<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-735</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area of SCP-735 is to be monitored twenty-four hours a day by at least four Foundation personnel. Any signs of activity are to be reported immediately to Dr. ████.</p><p>If the Moon's cycle occurs during the night, local police and emergency services are to be notified of the situation before any major containment procedures are enacted. The security perimeter around the SCP-735 site is to be kept cordoned off with minimum visual and audio access.</p><p>In the event that the Moon's cycle coincides with an organized celebration or event, Foundation personnel are to be placed in strategic locations on-board vehicles and aircraft, as well as on rooftops within the containment area.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-735 is an anomalous phenomenon which occurs when the Moon is at its last quarter or first quarter, which coincides with either the day after a full moon or the day before a new moon. The area of effect varies, depending on the date.</p><p>The effect of SCP-735 is to cause all individuals within the affected area to become extremely superstitious, to the extent that they believe that an eclipse is occurring.</p><p>Affected individuals will begin by behaving in a manner compatible with their beliefs, such as standing still, turning away from the sun, covering their eyes and mouths with cloth, etc. As time goes on and their behavior becomes more extreme, they will begin to experience other symptoms including severe anxiety, nausea, a feeling of nausea, headaches, hallucinations and insomnia. They believe that if they do not experience these things during an eclipse, they will die. Some have reported experiencing panic attacks similar to those experienced by victims of Hitchcock's Syndrome.</p><p>If there are no signs of life in any location near the boundaries of SCP-735, it will become active again after 18 hours. If any living beings enter the area during this time period, SCP-735 will activate instantaneously and terminate all life forms within the containment area. However, if it activates while humans are present inside a vehicle or building that is located within the containment zone of SCP-735, then it will not activate unless someone tries to exit the vehicle or jumps out of the window.</p><p>SCP-735 was discovered when two Foundation researchers were engaged in observation of SCP-███ in ██████ ████ when they noticed a large crowd gathering outside of town. They immediately notified local police and attempted to contain the situation before further anomalous activity took place. The resulting incident had no known casualties but caused significant damage to infrastructure and property throughout ██████ ████.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
