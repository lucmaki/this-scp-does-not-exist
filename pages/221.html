<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-221</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-221 is currently non-operational and is to be kept in its standard containment locker. It is to be locked with a key only possessed by Dr. ████████. A Level 3 access key is also required to deactivate the object. When not being used as a system upgrade, SCP-221 should be stored at level 4b of the safe room in a secure locker.</p><p>Due to its limited operational history, SCP-221 has been deemed a Safe Class item and poses no threat to Foundation personnel or other SCPs.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-221 is a circuit board with a printed circuit board housing approximately 2,000 integrated circuits, each capable of performing 0.4 operations per microsecond. A 1Gbps packet buffer on the printed circuit board sends and receives data at rates of 121MB/s. When SCP-221 is not in use, all internal components are powered off and are only capable of performing point-to-point communication.</p><p>When SCP-221 is connected to any existing 2Gbps packet transmission system, it can perform a communication network utilizing only two dimensions. Currently, SCP-221 is being used as an upgrade for Foundation communications systems to transmit data at the speed of light.</p><p>SCP-221 was recovered from the ████████ Radio Observatory in ██████████, where it had been adapted into a point-to-point radio and installed on site by Dr. ████████. SCP-221's primary function was to send and receive experimental messages to and from Earth. An anomalous effect was observed when Dr. ████████ attempted to transmit data to Earth using SCP-221's sent data channel (the 'x' channel). Dr. ████████ reported that the transmitted data appeared as white radio waves propagating along a single dimension instead of along three dimensions.</p><p>When Dr. ████████ attempted to send data to Earth the second time, he noted that the white waves were no longer viewable as "points" but instead appeared as dim blue lights with an estimated intensity of one star per 100 trillion miles from Earth. Upon further experimentation, Dr. ████████ discovered that by transmitting information at speeds approaching light speed, any object could be viewed across multiple dimensions simultaneously.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
