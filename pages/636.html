<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-636</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Hyper-threat</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-73 is to be guarded by two on-duty sentinels of Site-77 at all times. The coordinates of SCP-636 are to be entered into the mainframe at Site-77 using the command "INPUT 6636", and added to Local File ███, which is to be stored in a standard Foundation database.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-636 is a SCP registered under the name of "UNPUBLISHED", with the imprint "UNPUBLISHED", currently in the possession of The Foundation.</p><p>The number 636 was written down on a piece of paper by a man named ██████ ████████████ (henceforth referred to as SCP-636-1) shortly after his death. It seems that this number was important to the deceased, but no details are known.</p><p>SCP-636 has several anomalous properties, which have been observed so far. All of these effects are only present when SCP-636 is being read, clapped or played improperly. In all other conditions, the existence of these effects is unknown and unobservable.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
