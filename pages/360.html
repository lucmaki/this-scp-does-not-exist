<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-360</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area surrounding SCP-360 is to be fenced off, and access is to be granted only to personnel with Level-2 security clearance or higher. Personnel who wish to visit the area should inform their supervisors of any hazardous substances they may encounter.</p><p>If any human specimens are still alive after contact with SCP-360, they are to be kept in an adjacent cell, isolated from the main chamber and provided with sufficient food, water and air. The subjects must not be permitted outside SCP-360's containment chamber otherwise the effect will dissipate, and they will immediately regain their senses. Any subjects which survive the process are to be humanely terminated via injection of amnestics; this may be delayed if necessary for scientific study of the substance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-360 is a continuously functioning, self-replicating nanobot. Due to the nature of their replication process, the range of SCP-360s (and the entire containment area) is exponentially growing. When placed in a six cubic meter space, the current range of SCP-360s (estimated to be over twelve million) will eventually reach into the entire distance between Earth and the Moon. At this point, all human specimens will undergo a process similar to that described above and will lose their memories of being in SCP-360.</p><p>SCP-360 was first encountered on ████'███ when a subject attempted to transport several specimens from another site. In addition, three subjects voluntarily attempted to leave their cell in order to trace the source of SCP-360. Upon exiting their cell, all subjects immediately became severely disoriented and began screaming for help. All subjects were found dead shortly afterwards, with multiple levels of hypothermia and aspiration injuries present in all cases. Autopsies performed by an individual with Level-2 clearance confirmed that these injuries were consistent with surviving exposure to dry ice vapors or other substances known to cause lung damage or death in humans.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
