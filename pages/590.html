<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-590</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe (See Add</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-590 is to be kept in a standard Safe class containment locker at Site 14, located in ██████, MI. Any personnel attempting to access SCP-590's properties must use a shielded and encrypted communications channel. The following transcript of SCP-590's speech is to be transcribed and written on a microfilm strip inserted into the object. Personnel should not attempt to remove the object from its cell until after an approved period of time has elapsed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-590 is a silver watch with an estimated value of over 200,000 Dollars. The only marking on the object is "A.S. Walther. Geneva, Switzerland." SCP-590 is currently disassembled for analysis, and will likely be examined in this state for the rest of its usefulness. However, given the current trend towards mechanization, there is a real possibility that it could be recovered intact at some point in the future.</p><p>SCP-590 can cause any timepiece to display its properties due to simple contact. In less dramatic situations the anomalous effect is often purely a minor annoyance, but in more extreme cases subjects have reported severe strain while attempting to operate multiple timepieces simultaneously. It takes approximately two hours for subjects (or subjects and observers) to become sufficiently familiar with the object's effects to desensitize themselves to them.</p><p>The following conversation was recorded by Dr. ████████ during his first interaction with SCP-590:</p><p>Dr. ████████: Do you mean to tell me that this watch doesn't stop ticking? Every second?</p><p>SCP-590: Indeed, Dr. ████████. And I will continue so long as you wish me to.</p><p>Dr. ████████: Why are you doing this? Why would you make yourself your own accessory?</p><p>SCP-590: The same reason as anyone else, Doctor. I can go dashing about all day, or I can go docilely ambling about like a normal man might do or I can sit on a park bench reading an old newspaper or I can make myself useful by making my time last longer than it really should because it is not precisely my own time and if I am not having fun then why am I doing it? But when my time comes around again then I will let someone else enjoy it!</p><p>Dr. ████████: How much time have you bought with…your owners?</p><p>SCP-590: Much more than they deserve, but they haven't seen that yet have they doctor? No one has! They've simply been able to press their hands onto this watch and take what little pleasure they're permitted before being forced back into the mundane world of mere mortals where no one cares about their existence even though we all know that it exists! I know you don't see it because for you time moves at the same pace no matter how fast or slow you push it along but try watching this clock from the corner of your eye! See if it doesn't look different! See if it isn't unique! See if you don't want more!</p><p>Dr. ████████: Please answer my questions as honestly as possible Miss Walther.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
