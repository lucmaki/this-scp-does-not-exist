<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-572</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-572 is to be contained within one (1) sealed containment unit. No personnel are allowed within the inner chamber of the containment unit under any circumstances. A full complement of on-site personnel are to be prepared to enter the chamber when a test with SCP-572 is required.</p><p>All personnel entering the containment unit must wear flammable protective clothing and equipment, including gloves and emergency respirators, prior to entering. The inner chamber is to be equipped with a pyrotechnic alarm system before it can be entered. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to enter the chamber will activate the alarm and request additional emergency personnel, who will respond as instructed.</p><p>The entrance to SCP-572's containment unit is surrounded by a twelve (12) meter high blast wall of steel, lined with [REDACTED] fill, reinforced with multiple layers of concrete, in order to withstand any possible blasts from SCP-572.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-572 is a creature commonly described as resembling a two (2) meter wide, pale green monster with large, bulbous ears and a large, crescent-shaped mouth. SCP-572 has been observed to occasionally open its mouth while in its inactive state, but has yet to attempt to make any vocalizations.</p><p>SCP-572 is capable of moving at a maximum speed of twenty (20) km/h over short distances, however it appears to prefer to stay within the confines of its sealed containment unit. SCP-572 will occasionally generate a blinding white flash of light during the day, and appear at night in an inaccessible area around its containment unit.</p><p>Only personnel that remain within the inner chamber of SCP-572's containment unit for at least seventy-two (72) hours are able to make observations on the entity from a close range. During this time period, personnel have noted that SCP-572 will be able to manipulate small items of metal within the unit and will attempt to remove these objects from its immediate vicinity whenever possible. It possesses no discernible means of locomotion or transportation outside the sealed containment unit.</p><p>According to reports from Dr. Rennard, who spent three years observing SCP-572, "the entity will occasionally place objects in sealed metal containers and move them to different locations within the chamber; when exposed to humans, it has been observed dragging items and objects towards people that could potentially be used by itself." No physical evidence has been found regarding these actions, suggesting that SCP-672 uses anti-material constructs in place of conventional vehicles.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
