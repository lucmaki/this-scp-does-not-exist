<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-441</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-441 is to be kept in a standard containment cell equipped with a cot, refrigerator, and incense. SCP-441 may be permitted to attend sessions at Containment Site-██, but it is forbidden to speak or interact with any personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-441 is a humanoid composed of grass with two large horns protruding from its head. SCP-441's physiology is typical for its kind. It is able to move at speeds of up to 200 km/h and has expressed interest in cooperating with researchers in testing new transportation methods.</p><p>When not under the influence of hallucinogenic agents, SCP-441 expresses extreme hatred for humans, perceiving them as savages who have desecrated its rightful home by feeding it to cows.</p><p>Humans appear to be the only sentient beings that SCP-441 has deemed non-hostile; it will attack any other creature with little provocation. Evidence suggests that SCP-441 is capable of coherent speech and is able to form simple sentences. It will only speak when under the influence of hallucinogens or when spoken to by a human, however it has demonstrated an ability to understand basic spoken language in response to questions.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
