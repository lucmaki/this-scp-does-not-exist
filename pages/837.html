<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-837</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> It is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-77 outfitted with a modified organic plant growth chamber. SCP-837 is to be fed a high quality diet, free of harmful chemicals, and several liters of water are to be provided daily. SCP-837 is not to be permitted to contact the outside world through any means. Any personnel found distributing or possessing SCP-837 outside of approved channels are subject to immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-837 is a humanoid, roughly 5 m in height, who has not yet entered into adulthood. SCP-837 exhibits no mutations or abnormalities. SCP-837 appears to be entirely physically human save for the shape of its head and limbs. SCP-837 shows similar behavior to humans; it is intelligent, capable of speech, and capable of logical thought. SCP-837 is completely immune to the effects of memetic agents believed by medical personnel (the Foundation’s medical staff) to affect all humans, indicating that it is mutant in origin.</p><p>SCP-837’s anomalous properties manifest when it is exposed to an organism with a genetic makeup similar to its own. Upon exposure, SCP-837 will communicate and act as if it were the relative of the organism. If a human is exposed to SCP-837, they will believe that SCP-837 is their relative even if genetically unrelated. This process is irreversible unless the human has died, in which case it will attempt to restore them to life and maintain an emotional relationship with them. This process requires no machines or other external equipment.</p><p>Any human who believes that they are related to SCP-137 (the designation given to individuals affected by SCP-137), will become exponentially more aggressive over time and possess delusions about being subjected to altered genetic material or a combination of both. Due to this incompatibility with normal humans, exposure does not have any other effects on nonanomalous persons outside of those associated with the actions mentioned above.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
