<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-697</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-697 is currently contained at Site-██. Due to its size, SCP-697 is kept in a large holding cell, measuring about 1 km in length and 0.5 km in width.</p><p>The perimeter of SCP-697's containment cell is lined with barbed wire, and patrolled by security teams armed with non-lethal weaponry. Access to SCP-697's containment cell is restricted to Site personnel.</p><p>Any staff members affected by SCP-697 are to be removed from the site and given treatment as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-697 is an unidentified species of large sea turtle, measuring approximately 2 km in length.</p><p>SCP-697's body is covered with a thick layer of armor plating, composed primarily of a calcium carbonate mineral. However, the bulk of SCP-697's shell is composed of kelp, despite not being native to its aquatic environment.</p><p>Incidentally, SCP-697's shell material seems to be unable to penetrate, puncture or otherwise damage any of the building materials present within the site it is kept at, despite the force and size of others that were able to cause this effect.</p><p>SCP-697 alters its body shape and tactics in order to avoid capture. It appears almost completely incapable of communicating verbally or through other sensory means. Instead, it utilizes a series of natural methods to communicate, including the use of large groups of predatory fish as sentinels; a crude method of vocalization; and by submerging itself completely in water, effectively ceasing all activity until reawakened by environmental stimuli.</p><p>SCP-697 will only speak when it is in danger or extremely agitated by another event. The exact content of whatever has caused SCP-697 to become distressed is unknown; however, there have been several cases where this has not been limited solely to verbal communication, but also extended to other forms of behavior shown by SCP-697.</p><p>Due to its size and appearance, SCP-697 is typically unapproachable unless provoked in some manner. In such cases, SCP-697 will fight with all available means necessary to defend itself from capture or death.</p><p>Although most individuals who are captured by SCP-697 show no signs prior to their containment within its enclosure that indicate they are aware that SCP-697 is what they are fighting against, there have been several instances recorded with abnormally long periods of time between being taken captive and showing signs that they realize this fact for what it is. Although these individuals have never exhibited any further anomalous behavior after escaping their confinement, the circumstances surrounding their initial capture remain a mystery.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
