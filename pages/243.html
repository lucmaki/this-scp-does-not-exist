<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-243</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-243 is currently contained in a standard office desk drawer at Site-██. No special precautions are required in order to contain SCP-243 itself as it poses no immediate threat to any living entity.</p><p>SCP-243 is currently classified as a Safe object due to its appearance, which poses no present threat to any living creature. The only known way of opening the lid of SCP-243 is through the use of an ordinary key. Further research into this particular limitation is currently ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-243 is the name of an office desk drawer, currently located at Site-██. SCP-243 appears to be a standard desk drawer with a normal keylock on the bottom. However, once the lid is opened and closed, it displays no long-term effect on its contents; any documents contained within SCP-243 will return to their original state in about 24 hours.</p><p>Documents contained within SCP-243 do not display any anomalous effects until they are first returned to their rightful place. This window of time usually lasts from 12 to 24 hours from the time of sending back an object until the object returns to its original state. Documents that have not been located for 30 days are considered "lost" and are disposed of.</p><p>SCP-242 does not appear to capture or display any patterns or trends within its effect; however, there is no way to avoid returning objects to their natural state. Once returned, all documents inside SCP-242 will return to their original placement within 24 hours regardless of how they were originally placed into SCP-242 (i.e.: if they were stuck by hand, they could still have been placed into SCP-242 through a desk drawer).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
