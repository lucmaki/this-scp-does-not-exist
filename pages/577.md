<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-577</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-577 is located in a large containment chamber that houses SCP-577's core as well as a small monitoring station. One security guard is to be stationed outside of SCP-577's chamber at all times. The doors to SCP-577's containment chamber should remain sealed and guarded at all times. In the event SCP-577 begins to move, Foundation personnel are to approach it remotely via secured computer terminal and make the appropriate changes. All information pertaining to SCP-577 must be considered Class III personnel only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-577 is a vending machine that was manufactured in 1966. SCP-577 is composed of an aluminum chassis, a plastic casing, and an assortment of levers and buttons. SCP-577 has not been altered from its original manufacturing. There are several anomalous properties to SCP-577, but the most notable trait is that it will self-repairs within 3 hours after sustaining damage or after being damaged for an extended period of time.</p><p>SCP-577 does not contain any type of money and instead does not react to any form of currency; instead, it will accept everything but cotton candy. The item will then dispense a small piece of cotton candy with each use. This effect can be negated by placing a piece of cotton candy in the dispensing slot before activation.</p><p>SCP-577's primary anomalous property is the time it takes to repair itself after sustaining damage. Upon first inspection, SCP-577's core demonstrated only minor wear and tear and was able to repair itself within 4 hours after sustaining severe damage. After these initial tests, additional systems were added to SCP-577's chassis, including a remote control unit, computer chips, and batteries. SCP-577 continues to repair itself at an accelerated rate. On 9/30/2011, it was able to self-repair within 10 seconds upon sustaining fatal injuries.</p><p>After recovering from this incident, further tests were conducted on SCP-577's secondary and tertiary systems as well as its primary system. On 10/10/2011, testing 577 - A was carried out on SCP-577's tertiary systems. The final test was conducted on 11/19/2011; Testing 577 - C involved computer chips being placed in the primary system and a 'Get Cotton Candy' command being given through the remote control unit.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
