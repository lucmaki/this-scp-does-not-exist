<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-277</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-277 has been contained in a soundproof containment chamber, measuring 25x25x30 cm (10 cubic feet). SCP-277 is to be contained in the chamber's south side, with its base facing west; however, the north and east sides of the room may be used by researchers for testing purposes.</p><p>The chamber is to be kept at a constant temperature of 22 degrees Celsius (50 deg Fahrenheit). No sunlight is to enter any portion of the chamber, as this could alter SCP-277's properties. The chamber is to be cleaned once per week by D-class personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-277 is a tiny spherical structure, measuring 1.5cm in radius and 0.8cm in height. It has no edges, but roughly resembles a triangular prism with a slightly bulging top. Its surface is smooth and mirrors the appearance of any nearby surface (including other SCPs). SCP-277's interior is completely empty, with no light source or source of temperature known to exist within it.</p><p>SCP-277 causes large amounts of heat to be generated in its vicinity. This heat will take an initial form (resembling normal body heat) that will usually dissipate within several hours. However, if SCP-277 is held by a subject for more than 3 hours, SCP-277's heat will instead form into the shape of an adult human female (designated SCP-277-1), who will attempt to communicate through speech and gestures with any person holding SCP-277. Attempts at communication are typically met with resistance; however, SCP-277-1 has been seen speaking in English, German, French and Dutch, and attempts to translate them have been successful.</p><p>SCP-277-1 displays the ability to manipulate matter from this heat through "telekinesis", which manifests as small objects such as pencils, feathers, silk flowers and other small trinkets. For every 5 minutes spent interacting with subjects holding SCP-277, an additional item can be telekinetically manipulated from within its internal temperature.</p><p>When outside of the immediate presence of subjects holding SCP-277, SCP-277-1's form does not change. When observed directly by D class personnel, the subject's form will rotate once every 2 minutes until they disappear from sight. The subject's form reverts back to normal when leaving the immediate presence of D class personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
