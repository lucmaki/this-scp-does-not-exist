<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-607</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-607 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-43. SCP-607 is to be inspected once every two weeks by security personnel, who are to report any damage or changes in the object's exterior. No personnel are to enter SCP-607 without written authorization from Level 3 staff.</p><p>SCP-607 is to be monitored at all times for any signs of movement or other activity. Any unauthorized interaction with SCP-607 is grounds for disciplinary action. Any personnel who violate these procedures are to be terminated immediately and their belongings confiscated for study.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-607 is a standard office desk with a metal lock on the counter. The inscription "KEEP OFF" appears on the front of the desk. The lock can be opened with a standard key, with the exception of one key which will not fit the lock. Attempting to open SCP-607 with this key produces no results.</p><p>When an individual sits at SCP-607 and closes their eyes, they will report seeing their own face for approximately two minutes before losing consciousness. After this, the subject will have no recollection of what transpired during this time.</p><p>SCP-607 was recovered from a house in ████████, Australia after reports of mass suicide and gruesome killings began to surface. When police arrived at the scene, three human corpses were found hanging from a tree outside of the house, each sporting deep lacerations on different parts of their bodies. During interviews, all eleven inhabitants claimed that they had been possessed by an entity named "The Boss" who would order them to commit one murder or another while they slept. All murder victims were found to have met the same grisly end as the residents of the house, though no bodies were found at the crime scenes or inside SCP-607's containment cell.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
