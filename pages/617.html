<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-617</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-617 is stored in the Site-12 Storage Facility. No more than two staff members are to be present for testing of SCP-617. One technician has been assigned to SCP-617; any further experiments require her authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-617 is a small, red plastic table toy with a piece of paper inside. A drawing of an anthropomorphic turtle named "Chris" is printed on the paper. The only identifying marker on the paper are two lines in blue ink: "Please help me".</p><p>SCP-617's anomalous properties activate upon it being scratched on a flat surface, typically a wall or floor. If the paper inside is removed, SCP-617 will move away from the object that created the scratch. SCP-617's movements are erratic and uncontrollable; to date, no consistent path has been observed.</p><p>After establishing movement, SCP-617 will begin to travel at its greatest speed towards any marked room on the same floor level. Common places such as homes, libraries and offices have been recorded, but rooms outside of these places have also been documented. For example, SCP-617 was found in an abandoned Mall after wandering through several deserted buildings for several hours. It took several days for SCP-617 to navigate back out of the mall again by selecting its current route to "move forward", much to the dismay of those who wanted it to stop moving. SCP-617 will continue attempting to return to its starting location until it exits an indoor location at which point it reverts to an inert state.</p><p>SCP-617 can be made not to act if desired; however, this requires direct knowledge of its anomalous properties. Any personnel involved in ensuring that this happens are administered Class D amnestics and $5,000 USD in cash upon completion of testing for maintaining information about SCP-617's status.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
