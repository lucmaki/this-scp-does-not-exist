<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-588</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-588 is to be contained in an airtight containment unit, watertight, and lined with sound-proofing material. Standard cleaning procedures are to be followed when removing SCP-588 from the containment unit.</p><p>Personnel interacting directly with SCP-588 are not to use facial hair at any time. They are to maintain an unobtrusive mustache at all times. Any personnel attempting to grow a beard so as to properly conceal their face are to be denied access to SCP-588 and initially quarantined for two weeks before being permitted to return and interact with it. If they request the use of SCP-588 again, they will be required to undergo monthly monitoring of their beard growth, during which they are allowed to remove their facial hair.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-588 is a large vial containing a viscous, dark green liquid. It appears to be mostly water, with various organic components (including several unidentified barks) and a few other compounds present. The temperature of SCP-588 is 94°C and its specific gravity 2.2. Its volume is 37 L.</p><p>Attempting to drink or ingest SCP-588 causes the subject to explode violently, with a force of approximately 30 kN, followed by the liquefaction of whatever substance they were imbibing.</p><p>When placed under the surface of skin, through cutaneous absorption, SCP-588 begins to grow hair at a faster rate than normal. After an initial growth period, the new hairs become very coarse, and more so as to provide protection from any potential damage caused by the growing mass. At this point, SCP-588 passes into its active phase; the hairs become finer still, more silky in texture and form, and grow like roots into whatever muscular tissue was contacted by them first. The subject only becomes aware that something has begun growing out of their face when it becomes apparent that their usual facial hair is not being replaced.</p><p>SCP-588 grows regardless of age or gender. Subjects have reported distinct feelings of discomfort when SCP-588 is first applied to their face; these feelings may continue for months after exposure ceases.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
