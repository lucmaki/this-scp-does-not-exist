<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-49</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-49 is to be contained in a standard containment cell within Site-19. At no time is the use of SCP-49 to draw outside of containment to be permitted. No exceptions.</p><p>If any personnel are found to employed by SCP-49, they will be terminated immediately. Any personnel caught attempting to employ SCP-49 outside of this procedure will also be terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-49 is a standard wooden pencil, approximately 12″ in length. Despite its anomalous properties, it is physically identical to a standard pencil. SCP-49 has the ability to imbue drawings with a small amount of extra color and detail not normally present within them. The colors and details are consistent when SCP-49 is used to draw within a specific time-frame between 1 and 24 hours.</p><p>SCP-49 will only be used for drawing and no other purpose. This includes, but is not limited to, writing or even using it as an implement for signing one's name.</p><p>Once these restrictions have been met, any drawing made by SCP-49 will reflect all colors present within the subject's perception of colors - however these colors will appear slightly out of place when compared to those that could normally exist in real life. For example, an orange red would appear as pink, yellow would seem green and so on.</p><p>Once inside the containment cell, SCP-49 will continue to draw as before until it's allowed outside again. Once outside, it will stop drawing until another subject (or objects) picks up the pencil and begins drawing again. Any other non-living object that comes into contact with the drawing created by SCP-49 will display an identical phenomenon; if 4 or more people create drawings while inside containment, they are expected to contain all colors present within the subject's perception of colors. The coloring system used by SCP-49 is similar yet different from that used by the human eye.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
