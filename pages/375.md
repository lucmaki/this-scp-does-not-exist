<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-375</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-375 is to be kept in a solitary humanoid containment unit, equipped with CCTV monitoring cameras and a closed loop air system. This containment chamber is to be continuously monitored by two (2) Level 4 personnel, who will monitor any and all activity within the boundaries of SCP-375’s chamber. These personnel are not to be exposed to SCP-375 for any reason whatsoever.</p><p>Within SCP-375’s chamber is a table furnished with two chairs, one for the subject and one for an observer (hereafter referred to as the “Observer”). An ornate knife made from ██████████ steel is located on the table, which is to be used solely by the subject in order to cut his own flesh.</p><p>The subject is free to roam around its chamber as he wishes; however, no more than ten (10) persons are allowed to observe him at any given time. It is highly recommended that no more than five (5) persons are present at any given time in order to prevent accidental exposure of the subject. Cameras must only record what the Observer can see.</p><p>Once every three (3) weeks, the subject shall be administered Class-A amnestics and will then be allowed a total of one (1) hour of recreation time; he may interact with any visitors during this time, but none may handle him.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-375 is a young male human, aged seventeen (17) years.</p><p>SCP-375 possesses a visual field of ██° in all directions, which is similar to that possessed by other humans. The only exceptions to this are:</p><p>SCP-375 has shown no signs of abnormal perception or increased intelligence.</p><p>SCP-375 is able to use its anomalous vision to read and comprehend written material with ease. SCP-375 was also able to learn to play the violin and piano in short amounts of time. SCP-375, though not known for his academic prowess, has demonstrated an advanced proficiency with mathematics and numerous languages; however, it is unclear as to whether SCP-375 possesses these skills naturally or not.</p><p>SCP-375’s anomalous perception allows him an unobstructed view of his surroundings at all times; he has no apparent blind spots.</p><p>SCP-375 possesses the ability to create large quantities of blood at will using nothing but his own hands. Furthermore, SCP-375’s blood is considered magical in nature, being extremely viscous and sticky, allowing it to “stick” on almost any surface as long as it does not come into contact with anything "exotic" (i.e., metal). Any living organism coming in contact with SCP-375's blood will report feeling a need for more blood.</p><p>In the event that an afflicted person cannot be found or made aware of their condition before consumption of SCP-375's blood is complete, the process will be repeated; however, the number of subjects affected will increase exponentially:</p><p>While they may appear otherwise healthy until consumed entirely by SCP-375’s blood, subjects affected by SCP-375 begin vomiting after fifty minutes of consumption and have shown no signs of regaining consciousness until approximately two (2) days later.</p><p>Vomiting can result in death if there are not too many subjects affected before they are finished with their food. Loss of consciousness occurs within hours after the final subject vomits, once again leaving behind a large amount of unused blood.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
