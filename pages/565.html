<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-565</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-565 is currently contained in a 1 m x 3 m x 3 m containment cell. Four observation windows have been constructed into SCP-565's floor and walls, and are only to be opened during testing. A food trough is also provided for the enclosure's standard diet of rodent and bird species.</p><p>During testing, one (1) D-Class personnel is to remain within SCP-565's area at all times, armed with a P90 submachine gun. Failure to comply with containment procedures will result in termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-565 is a three story apartment complex comprised of masonry, wood, and plastics. The exterior of SCP-565 only exhibits moderate wear and tear.</p><p>The interior of SCP-565 houses many complex mechanisms within each unit, including but not limited to:</p><p>No structural damage has been recorded, nor has any anomalous consequence been reported without the presence of a subject with knowledge of mathematics or science.</p><p>SCP-565 was discovered by Foundation agents after an anonymous tip was received to a local law enforcement agency in ████████, Italy. The whereabouts of the originator is currently unknown, as individuals that provided aid in the initial investigation were subjected to amnesticization. A 32 year old male resident of ████████ was apprehended by Foundation agents and taken into custody after testing the anomaly.</p><p>SCP-565-1 is a grey cat found within one of the rooms on all three floors of SCP-565. When approached, SCP-565-1 will retreat into a hiding spot within said room until prompted to exit. Attempts at sedation have failed due to a creature that appears to be composed of various metals and electronics, giving off noxious fumes in the process.</p><p>Test Procedure: D-50522, who is familiar with mechanics and basic programming, is to be left alone in SCP-565 for two (2) weeks. D-50522 is currently in the seventh week following his arrival at Site ██ for the duration thereof.</p><p>On ██/██/20██ at 10:09 AM EST, D-50522 exited SCP-565's front door with one minute remaining before its expiration time limit. Upon exiting SCP-565's front door, D-50522 proceeded down the stairs leading to the raised bedroom area of SCP-565. He then proceeded into the bedroom area where he observed SCP-565's primary anomaly being transpiring (See Notes From Testing Log). After closing the bedroom door behind him, D-50522 proceeded down the stairs leading back towards SCP-565's entrance to signal his desire to return home; however, he became paralyzed and collapsed into unconsciousness when he attempted to leave SCP-565. Upon recovery by Foundation medical staff, D-50522 was nonresponsive to questions regarding his experience within SCP-565 during his test period.</p><p>The following is an excerpt from D-50522's diary which contains statistical evidence that his paralysis was not caused by natural causes:</p><p>Diary Entries Only Found Basingstoke 1129/06/20</p><p>05:30 am: Wake up from nightmare about being pulled out from my family every 2 months for forced military training. No improvement through conversation with mother on phone call this morning; I'll call again tomorrow night if nothing changes…</p><p>10:00 am: I'm packing my bag for my leave from here tomorrow morning; I just wish writing about what I've experienced so far could make it all go away…</p><p>10:48 am: Joking around with my friend on Skype before leaving bed today; enjoying our time together being able to just talk about anything we want without it being considered "off limits". Sometimes I just don't know why my last name isn't more popular as everyone else on my branch of service….</p><p>12:00 pm: Leaving the house now; is it getting hot outside? Can't tell since my window won't open…. 1101/06/21</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
