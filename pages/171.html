<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-171</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-171 is to be kept within a locked storage room. Personnel are to keep their distance when interacting with the object, and are not allowed to touch it. No research involving the possession of SCP-171 may be conducted until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-171 is a wood and metal rocket, approximately two meters tall. The object is powered by an unknown source, and displays no evidence of reactor heat or resulting radiation. All attempts to determine the source have been unsuccessful. SCP-171 will continue to function regardless of external conditions. The object also exhibits several other unusual properties.</p><p>When placed in a vacuum (less than 10,000m), the object's propulsion system will operate at maximum efficiency for 100 hours before requiring another refill of air. The object will not stop unless its propulsion system is torn down and refilled from Earth. This "recharge time" can be extended if material is interjected in between refills. Refilling is currently only possible once every year from within Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>SCP-171 will always land on Earth (the object does not share any traits with commonly classified aerobots). In some instances, during high wind/tornado conditions, the object was able to successfully land on Mars or Venus.</p><p>Upon landing, the object will disappear within an average period of 5 minutes, leaving behind no visible traces or remains. No video footage exists of SCP-171 while it is operational outside a vacuum environment, except in one case where an image of SCP-171 was obtained by reflecting moonlight back off [DATA EXPUNGED]. Personnel are not to refer to this image as "video".</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
