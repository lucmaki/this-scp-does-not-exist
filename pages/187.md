<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-187</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> For the purposes of containment, known instances of SCP-187 are to be kept underground at a depth of 100 meters. A reinforced concrete dome is constructed above the site, with an airlock leading to a small compartment for maintenance purposes.</p><p>Visual surveillance of SCP-187 is to be maintained by a remote drone which is launched from the airlock once per week. Foodstuffs and fresh water are to be placed in one of the compartments within the airlock in order to prevent SCP-187 from taking residence there.</p><p>Any SCP-187 that leaves the underground chamber is to be investigated. Should such an occurrence be confirmed, mobile task force Zeta-7 ("Pest Control”) is to be called in for investigation and termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-187 is an effective (but not very well-known) biological weapon that can be used to infect and destroy a wide variety of plant and animal life. Its primary anomaly is that it requires the subject to have some form of romantic interest in the other creature before it becomes active.</p><p>This is represented by a parasitic, ring-shaped organism which resembles a species of mollusk, but is actually a microscopic virus that imparts feelings of affection in its host. The only way to inoculate oneself from SCP-187's effect is to then go on to develop affection for another living being. The virus effectively “kills” itself when the two subjects no longer agree with one another, and will transfer itself into the next victim for its reproductive cycle.</p><p>The effect of SCP-187 lasts for several years, but only if both subjects continue to work together with one another. The virus will kill any member of its host species who does not contribute towards its continued survival, up until the point where their physical requirements are no longer matched.</p><p>SCP-187 was discovered at [A]███ ████, ████████ ██, during what was assumed to be a routine search for… unusual herbivores. During containment procedures, a large quantity of SCP-187 was found as well as four human skeletons - all bearing various degrees of infection. Of these skeletons five were sent to Site ██ while a further three were preserved and kept on file at Site ██.</p><p>Investigation revealed that previous owners had established an underground farm with the intention of breeding animals without requiring outside assistance and nutrients; however, prior cooperation between the humans involved was not strongly held by any member of the group. As such, each individual soon developed severe cases of SCP-187 which caused them to consume their own organs in order to survive until the eventual spread of infection killed them off - at least two examples being cannibalism, resulting in death by septicemia.</p><p>Due to these circumstances, it currently remains unknown how many people were sealed inside this vault or how long they may have been trapped there before they began showing symptoms.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
