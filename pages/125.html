<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-125</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-125 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site 17. Its casing is to be checked regularly for any signs of damage and repaired if necessary.</p><p>SCP-125 is to be disconnected from its power source during testing, and checked for the presence of non-anomalous components before reconnection.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-125 is a coffee machine with two legs, capable of standing on its own. It is about the size of a small kettle and has a height of 102 cm. SCP-125 is made out of plastic, around the same colour as normal black coffee, though it always appears to be an off-white colour.</p><p>SCP-125 has no anomalous properties until its coffee is made. Once SCP-125's coffee has been brewed, however, it takes a humanoid shape. This humanoid can materialize entirely from SCP-125's coffee or from spilled coffee on the ground.</p><p>Upon its transition into this form, the coffee becomes transparent and translucent and can easily be seen through by onlookers. The coffee urn/coffee pot turns off for unknown reasons, switching back to normal function after about three hours of brewing. Currently, there does not seem to be a limit to how much SCP-125's coffee will make in one sitting; it is known to make between 60 kg and 1000 kg of coffee in one sitting.</p><p>Due to this phenomenon, the testing logs below have been redacted. Any information indicated with ██ is classified information or research data that cannot be reproduced or leaked without grave consequences.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
