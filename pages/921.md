<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-921</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All windows and doors in the containment area are to be sealed by means of a ducting system. Any movement detected within SCP-921 should be reported to a nearby station agent as well as security personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-921 is a large, sealed containment area located in the basement of Site-106, a Foundation experiment and containment facility. The area measures 1.5m x 2m x 1m, with no other entrances or exits present.</p><p>When within SCP-921, all objects will float about 0.4 meters above the ground with no discernible loss of mass. A lack of gravitational pull has been confirmed to account for this anomaly.</p><p>Testing has shown that SCP-921 can completely collect objects from outside, as well as objects from inside the containment area. When an item falls into SCP-921 from any direction, it will completely collect it and return to the field of gravity. MTF units assigned to this location have reported various behaviours when interacting with objects within the anomaly:</p><p>Door: When opened without the use of a key, doorways will show themselves to be closed behind them, with no change made to their position.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
