<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-662</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As the area covered by SCP-662 is relatively small, regular patrols are sufficient in addressing any incidents. Under no circumstances are civilian vehicles permitted to enter this area. No civilian vehicles are allowed to be rented or transported through the city to avoid a possible leak of information. Security personnel are to check all license plates and vehicles entering SCP-662 for any signs of an anomalous object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-662 is an area covering a two block radius around Murfreesboro Pike and Skyline Drive in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. It is located within the town of Smyrna, TN. There are no distinguishing characteristics aside from its anomalous nature.</p><p>Any vehicle entering SCP-662 will experience all objects moving at a slow speed. Some objects such as animals will become visible, but this effect is only noticeable when the vehicle itself is moving at a relatively slow speed. Low speeds at which the object becomes visible to the driver are difficult to observe, and objects appear to be flitting in and out of existence depending on the speed of the vehicle.</p><p>This effect can be circumvented with high speeds however. In this manner vehicles traveling above 60 mph displays the effect, though it is not as pronounced as at low speeds. The closure of Smyrnna Drive has somewhat negated this effect, but even at idle speeds other cars display this effect too.</p><p>At all times while driving within SCP-662, the front license plate on any stationary or moving vehicles can be seen in full detail by anyone with a view directly behind them (see Addendum). This area appears to have been specifically designed for surveillance purposes with several decoy stars placed on rooftops along with several "give way" signs leading up to and into the anomaly.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
