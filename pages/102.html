<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-102</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-102 is to be kept on a 24/7 video surveillance system at Site-17. At no time is the object to be removed from its chamber. Researchers are to be aware of the temperature in the room and if the slightest change in temperature is noted, or if any noise or unusual movement is detected, the object must be immediately disarmed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-102 is a large concrete box, measuring 5m x 7m x 4m. SCP-102 is composed of what appears to be stainless steel and reinforced with concrete walls. The object's exterior is covered in graffiti and resembles the design of an IKEA style storage unit. The object's interior is identical to other standard storage units with a temperature sensor, light bulb, drain and air conditioning unit.</p><p>SCP-102 possesses the power to "heat up" if exposed to temperatures lower than 0° [C]. When exposed to temperatures exceeding this limit, SCP-102 will effectively slow its temperature until it reaches a stable level at approximately 1.7°C (2.9°F). According to SCP-104, this does not cause any damage to the object or any deterioration in its appearance, contents or durability; however the extreme cold experienced by SCP-102 causes frostbite and severe surface damage to biological organisms.</p><p>Discovery: SCP-102 was discovered on 18 November 1989 in ████, Colorado. Two contractors were excavating an area for construction when they found a large concrete vault approximately 2 meters underground. Upon opening the vault, research teams were greeted with a very cold environment with thick fog covering the area. The walls were covered in graffiti dating back to 1991 and contained numerous outdated newspapers dated between 1975-1982. Between these dates a series of articles pertaining to a missing [REDACTED] individual known as "John Doe #1774" had been found. These articles contained crude drawings depicted the individual's face and detailed the murder of "John Doe #1774".</p><p>Further exploration revealed several boxes containing several old newspapers from the 1980s with writings on them regarding a missing persons case . These newspapers included one article detailing claims that John Doe #1774 had been found alive and well inside of SCP-102 with no signs or injuries upon his body. At this time Foundation agents located John Doe #1774 living in ██████, Colorado located 5km away from where SCP-102 was discovered.</p><p>Agent ████████ was sent into contact with John Doe #1774 and asked if he knew anything about his whereabouts before he disappeared off of his farm in ████, Colorado at age 8 years old after having injured himself while playing outside with friends on his block of land where he lived with his family at the time. John Doe #1774 did not remember anything that occurred prior to 1971 due to amnesia which began when he attempted suicide at age 11 years old by drinking three cans filled with gasoline mixed in milk after an incident involving him being bullied for his alcoholism by student's at █████ high school.</p><p>After reviewing various records it was discovered that John Doe #1774 had been reported as missing at age 9; however police never investigated because his family was able to establish several witnesses that had seen him leave home alone after having spent time alone for 6 hours; the witnesses stated that John would become unresponsive upon leaving home with mild intoxication in his breath and generally sweaty from spending time inside playing games on his console without taking any food or water during this period leading up to 1972 when he was reported missing by his parents at age 10 years old after saying goodbye to one of his neighbors who claimed he saw John riding away on a bike while wearing pajamas similar to what he owns today.</p><p>(Interview Logs)</p><p>Interviewed: John Doe #1774</p><p>Interviewer: Agent ████████</p><p>Foreword: Due to John's mental state after living in isolation for so many years coupled with his unresponsive demeanor during this interview, Agent ████████ was instructed by Dr. ████████████ not to use more than basic concepts he had been shown while reading through medical books on possible methods of rehabilitation over the course of three days prior as well as several medications placed upon John's body under order from Dr. ████████████ just prior to beginning this interview hoping it would drive him into becoming more alert and responsive throughout the course of this interview; however despite intensive rehabilitation efforts John remained unresponsive throughout each session regardless of medication being administered according to Dr. ████████████'s instructions on how best to treat John's condition given this information we must focus our dialogue more around general concepts rather than directly asking questions regarding how he regained memory loss within SCP-102 given everything he knew before being put into isolation within SCP-102 if we are unsuccessful I will be forced by Dr. ████████████'s orders not only will I be demoted but hopefully my career will finally come crashing down around my ears via disciplinary action which I can tell you Dr. ████████████ despises me personally for now…</p><p>[Drumming noise begins following questioning.]</p><p><Begin Log></p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
