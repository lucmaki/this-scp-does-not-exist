<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-267</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The containment procedures at Site-77 are to be updated after each SCP-267 containment breach, as well as periodically. The current containment procedures for SCP-267 are as follows:</p><p>To prevent SCP-267 from moving beyond the boundaries of its pit, a barrier wall has been constructed around the perimeter of the pit. This wall does not have to be impregnable from the outside; this is to limit damage to the surrounding area should SCP-267 breach containment at any time. The interior of Site-77 is maintained in a state of constant low temperature and desiccated environment. Periodically, personnel will enter Site-77 and perform regular maintenance tasks before entering.</p><p>Containment Procedures may be altered or modified at any time by Foundation personnel with level 6 security clearance or higher. Any personnel found breaking these protocols may have their credentials revoked until further notice. Any breach of containment by any means that was not intended by the Event Horizon Protocols may result in termination of security clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-267 is a snake avian monstrosity, the remains of which were found in the wild on the island state of Palawan in the Philippines. SCP-267 has been observed to be able to produce heat, at least when its body temperature is near 41 degrees Celsius.</p><p>SCP-267's intelligence level has not been determined yet; it has shown signs of attempting to communicate with personnel and has been created in various attempts at preventing containment breach by SCP personnel. The following are transcripts of SCP-267's attempts at communication.</p><p>Transcript 1:</p><p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p><p>Transcript 2:</p><p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p><p>Transcript 3:</p><p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
