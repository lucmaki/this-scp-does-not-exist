<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-807</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All personnel investigating SCP-807 must wear standard formal dress when approaching the area of SCP-807. All other areas of Foundation facilities in the United States have been cordoned off from public access as a precautionary measure. Any unauthorized persons attempting to enter either area of Foundation facilities must be detained or led away without alerting nearby nonhuman sentients.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-807 is a two-kilometer wide area of land located in a remote area of the southwestern United States, approximately 120 kilometers east of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The area is covered with an extremely high density of white pine trees (Pinus albicaulis), commonly known as pinyon pines. Within SCP-807 there is also a transitional zone between SCP-807 and the surrounding desert where sandstone outcroppings and rock formations can be found.</p><p>The landscape within SCP-807 contains numerous large stone structures consistent with Mesoamerican architecture and several rows of large stone figures, believed to be sculptures. It is currently unknown how the objects arrived in this location. Human bodies are not present.</p><p>If a human being attempts to enter the area of SCP-807 (defined as a person attempting to enter the transitional zone), they will report seeing other humans within the area, whom they characterize as wearing different styles of fur clothing and using technology not yet developed by humans today. These beings will call out to the individual, waving and gesturing towards them, but not approaching closer than 30 meters away at any given time. One group of these entities have been observed attempting to convey images such as those shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.</p><p>Figure 2: The Foundation has established that these images depict complex glyphs and designs which cannot be understood by humans. Attempts to translate them into English result in garbled text or nonsense word strings.</p><p>Figure 3: The Foundation has established that these figures represent concepts such as various animals and vegetation, including what appear to be depictions of maize plants, jaguars, and butterfly wings; this recent pattern suggests that "cultures" discovered within SCP-807 may have developed language capable of describing concepts outside the scope of human experience.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
