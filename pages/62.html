<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-62</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Bekind of</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-62 is to be kept in a 7 m x 3 m, 6 m high by 1 m thick iron and steel cage. This object is to be kept in the lowest security wing of Site-06. Security personnel are required to stand at least 2 m away when observing SCP-62. Any persons who would like to observe SCP-62 must first be administered a class-B amnestic.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-62 is an elephant that stands at 7 m in height. It also possesses a thicket of long, dark grey hair and extremely large ears. SCP-62 is capable of speaking English and Japanese, but prefers to speak English exclusively.</p><p>SCP-62 uses its gray hair as both material (for constructing things such as species specific clubs) and as a means of defense. At random intervals, SCP-62 will produce 1 ounce of what appears to be wood-iron alloy. This object is not affected by gravity or magnetism, however it does stand out from the rest of its body. This alloy expands into a cubic structure that bursts 2 seconds after production stops. There are no known effects after the alloy has expanded except for a brown stain and mild odor in the area where it was produced.</p><p>Interview 62-1:</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>SCP-62: Hey! Come on over here! You can't see me yet!</p><p>Dr R███████: Alright, SCP-62, let's get started!</p><p>SCP-62: Hey! I'm here! You can't see me, but don't worry, I can see you!</p><p>Dr R███████: Excuse me? What do you mean by that?</p><p>SCP-62: See these huge ears of mine? Well, I've always had really big ears… do you know how many times people have tried to force them down? But none of them could! I guess humans were having a lot more trouble there back then than they do now… They call me "Katog", because my ears are so big… but now I'm being called Elvis because of my hair! Man… that's so weird… I actually find it quite funny though! If only my neck didn't go all the way into my shoulders…</p><p>Dr R███████: … wow… You're… very unique. Can you give us any information regarding your ownership?</p><p>SCP-62: Yeah yeah yeah. Now if you can just sit down next to me that'd be great!</p><p>Dr R███████: - Yes, please sit down on the ground and wait for further instruction. Thank you. -</p><p>[Dr █████ leaves the area.]</p><p>Dr R███████: Hello sir? Hello?! Dr █████?! Come back here immediately! No one's sitting on grass anymore! Yes sir we understand this situation isn't favorable, especially given the current lack of personnel in the area… yes indeed sir… oh dear god we understand how frightening this must be for you sir… yes well without any volunteers there's nothing we can do about it sir other than offer you some more coffee or tea for your troubles. Whoops we might've touched on his nerves again there science officers – ah yes sir we're sorry about that – Then again it's a bit difficult with protocols and such when our field work is almost entirely observational — Okay, Mr Katog? Doh – I'm sorry if us being here makes you uncomfortable but if you aren't comfortable with us being here then we'll leave right away - Uhh oookay thanks for coming in sir - No problem at all — Thanks so much gentlemen. This conversation went better than expected. We managed to gain some valuable insight into our subject today.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
