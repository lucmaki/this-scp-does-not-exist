<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-961</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-961 is to be kept under observation in its room. Only D-class personnel are permitted access to the object's chamber.</p><p>SCP-961 may not be removed from its containment unless it is secured by a researcher with Level 2 or higher security clearance. If a researcher has not been assigned to SCP-961, no personnel may enter its chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-961 is a plain curtain from a local theatre. The curtain's last performance was in the play "Lobster Cove" in ███████, England, on ██/██/19██.</p><p>When any person touches SCP-961, they will disappear. This effect will last for approximately five (5) minutes before ending abruptly, with no trace of the subject's remains being present.</p><p>SCP-961 was recovered by Mobile Task Force Delta-6 ("Black Cats") after several reports of townsfolk vanishing. Foundation agents posing as MTF agents interrogated ██ witnesses while several Class D personnel (including an agent disguised as a tree) observed the event. When questioned about their sudden disappearance, eyewitnesses claimed that they had been handcuffed to their chairs, and then "thrown out the window", leading to their apparent demise.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
