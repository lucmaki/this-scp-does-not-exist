<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-763</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-763 is to be surrounded at all times by Level 4 personnel from Security clearances, who are to respond to any civilian trespassing. Any trespasser found within SCP-763 is to be detained and questioned, and are to be restrained until the end of the tour.</p><p>The stairway itself is to be quarantined, and the air in it to be evacuated periodically. Should a captive test subject be found attempting to leave the stairway or escape into it, they are to be detained until the end of the tour, and then subjected to termination by Security personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-763 is a tour of the borderlands of Mexico, consisting of a stairway descending into a chasm. The stairway descends in an upward spiral over one hundred and fifty meters.</p><p>Anyone venturing down the stairway will die within minutes, but if they make it to the end of the line they will be revived and found by Researcher Jorge Cárdenas and returned to the containment area where they initially entered.</p><p>SCP-763 was discovered when Researcher Jorge Cárdenas was sent to investigate reports of trespassers. His initial account stated that he had searched for intruders on numerous occasions without success, and determined that this was due to people believing SCP-763 to be a regular tourist attraction. He then investigated the second floor, discovering a room filled with dead test subjects, which were all wearing shuttle passes bearing his name.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
