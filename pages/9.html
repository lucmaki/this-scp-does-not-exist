<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9 is to be kept in a low-humidity storage container in Site-77. SCP-9 is to be monitored by an automated weather station to ensure that the temperature remains between 10°C and 20°C. In addition, SCP-9 is to be moved at least once every ten days to prevent corrosion of the valves.</p><p>Should SCP-9's ventilation system fail, it is logistically feasible to construct a replacement apparatus. However, due to the risk of contamination by SCP-9's unique content, such an act would only be permitted following the presence of a team of three (3) Level 3 personnel. Immediately after maintenance work begins, all personnel are to wear full protective suits and Hazardous Environment Suits (HES).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9 is a plant grown in the interior of a large steel-and-aluminum storage tank. Owing to its anomalous nature, it has been maintained and studied by the Foundation since its discovery in 1972. SCP-9 is large enough to require a team of two (2) Level 3 personnel to move. It consists of a mixture of water and dried fish, which are believed to be the cause of its growth rate. This growth is aided by the presence of a naturally occurring, highly conductive fluid in the bottom of SCP-9's container.</p><p>The content of SCP-9 is extremely unusual; however, this is believed to be caused by an unknown property embedded within the plant material. The liquid inside SCP-9 appears to be composed entirely of sodium chloride (common salt), although any compound formed from sodium chloride would not normally remain liquid at room temperature. As such, SCP-9 is able to remain at its current temperature regardless of what method is used to cool it down below its boiling point (which has so far been reported as 31°C). Addition chemicals have been known to help solidify the salt, sometimes becoming visible through SCP-9's clear walls.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
