<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-86</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Harmless</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-86 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber. SCP-86 is to be fed two pounds of nuts per day, though only three hundred grams of these are needed for sustenance and the rest are to be saved for replanting.</p><p>In the event that SCP-86 dies all remaining nuts are to be thrown into his containment chamber at once, SCP-86 has been known to produce more than one hundred thousand pounds of nuts in a single day.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-86 is a human male, aged sixty-six years old and regal in stature. DNA testing has shown that SCP-86 is entirely human, but it is unclear precisely how he came to possess the ability to generate nuts.</p><p>SCP-86's anomalous properties manifest when he consumes nine kilograms of raw or roasted cashews within twenty four hours. It is unknown whether this effect occurs due to any form of nut allergy on the part of SCP-86.</p><p>In the case where SCP-86 consumes roasted cashews, he will be capable of generating additional mass at a rate of roughly one kilogram per minute. This new mass cannot be determined if it originates from potential nut matter already present in his body; it seems that SCP-86 does not need to eat raw nuts for this effect to occur.</p><p>While under these conditions SCP-86 has shown a remarkable capacity to produce large amounts of nuts within a short period. The production of nuts by SCP-86 has also been observed as an extremely labor intensive process; with no discernable source of power SCP-86 must rely upon his own muscles for movement and counter pressure, though it seems the end result is worth the effort.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
