<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-962</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-962 is to be contained within a steel tank of 200 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height. The interior of the tank is lined with lead and concrete, and the tank is to be filled with water. A lid to the top of the tank is to be kept on at all times; attempts to remove this lid will result in immediate termination.</p><p>SCP-962 is to be fed a diet consisting of fish, crustaceans, and small mammals; the exact composition of this diet is at the discretion of Dr. ████████.</p><p>The exterior of SCP-962's containment tank should consist of a 10 cm thick layer of lead; any breach above this thickness will result in immediate termination. In case of emergency, personnel that breach more than 1 cm of the lead casing are to be terminated immediately and replaced. Any attempt by researchers to interact with SCP-962 should be restricted only to approved testing procedures, unless given explicit approval from O Command.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-962 is a large, squid-like creature measuring approximately 1.5 meters in length and weighing an estimated 200 kilograms. The body of SCP-962 appears to be made of a material similar to steel, and has no discernible organs or bones. The head of SCP-962 bears two large black eyes with a circumference of roughly half that of the entire body. The mouth of SCP-962 is located at the base of the body, near a small ocular organ; this mouth is capable of producing a purple substance that may be used for communication purposes.</p><p>SCP-962 possesses the ability to alter its size at will and can assume any form from that of a squid to that of a human. SCP-962's actual size is dependent on the form it takes; when in human form, SCP-962 appears to be 2 cm tall and weighs 3 kg. In squid form, SCP-962 is roughly 10 cm long and weighs approximately 30 kg.</p><p>The current state of SCP-962's brain is unknown; however, it appears to have several functions similar to those possessed by other organisms. For example, it can see, hear, taste, and feel pain like normal humans. It also possesses basic emotions such as fear and anger; however, these are not dependent on stimuli like they are in normal humans.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
