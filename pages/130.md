<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-130</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-130 is to be kept in a secure containment chamber behind an airtight door. SCP-130's container is to be regularly inspected and cleaned. Any deviations are to be immediately reported to MTF Tau-24 "Resistance".</p><p>The primary method of containment consists of closely monitoring SCP-130 itself. At this time, SCP-130's containment chamber has been designed such that it will become dormant at the end of any given month. Those portions of SCP-130's body which are not dormant is to be attached by steel cables to the containment chamber walls. In the event that SCP-130 experiences activity beyond the design specifications, all personnel entering the containment chamber must wear full protection against radiation and non-anomalous carcinogenic and/or mutagenic agents, as well as standard radiation suits and respirators.</p><p>A secondary method of containment consists of closely monitoring every individual who works with SCP-130. Personnel are instructed to report any signs of cancer in their families or significant others, abnormal cell growths on bodies, or changes in physical appearance. The Foundation has provided ██ years of medical research dedicated toward locating the cause(s) of anomalous cell growths, including the development of vaccines for all known types.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-130 is a humanoid entity, composed of a complex network of steel cables, connected to an electrically-powered generator. SCP-130's mass and height are variable, but the currently reported measurements include a mass of ███ kg and a height of 5.3 meters. Over the course of its containment, SCP-130 has gone through several distinct stages (generally described under the heading "Cell Line: No Lower Energy Level Than ONE"). The standard set of instructions for containment is based on this newest stage, in which SCP-130 is believed to be using an increasingly-complex form of kinesis involving advanced robotics and robotics technology.</p><p>SCP-130's containment chamber is filled with cryogenic liquid nitrogen at all times. Despite its appearance, SCP-130's main body appears to be entirely composed of living tissue, albeit heavily altered. The amount and types of modified constituent matter have changed over time (see Addendum A), with the most recent major change being the addition of a grid pattern covering most surfaces.</p><p>All biological processes within SCP-130's body appear to be wholly independent from any external sources; this includes the generation of free radicals, which are present in all bodily tissues regardless of age. These free radicals have no known effect on themselves or other tissues within SCP-130's body; as a result, they may be considered "naturally protective". Due to this feature and its anomalous durability, it is theorized that SCP-130 may possess highly-advanced regenerative functions beyond those possessed by any known living organism.</p><p>SCP-130 was first observed within the University Medical Center in ██████, █████ during routine surveillance of the human populace by the Foundation. According to various newspaper articles at the time, Dr. ████ █████████ had been experimenting with bioengineering techniques involving live tissue grafts. Shortly after his disappearance (no charges were brought against him due to his status as a prominent researcher), SCP-130 was observed following Mr. ██████ █████████ (father of Dr ██████████) from its home laboratory in Dr. ██████████'s basement laboratory into a storage space beneath the house where his family resided. Later investigations revealed that Mr. ██████████ had been afflicted with acute lung cancer and had spent several days receiving surgery and radiation before dying early on October 1st, 1982.</p><p>Despite initial fears that SCP-█0 would kill others in its vicinity (and even potentially infect them directly), it did not attack anyone directly or display any aggressive behavior until several months later when it moved into the upstairs bedroom of Mr. ██████'s daughter, Ms O██████ ██████████. During this period, it expressed several emotions and developed several physical changes consistent with those seen in active stages 3 through 5 (see Addendum A). It also began developing new kinesis abilities consistent with modern robotics technology; testing conducted shortly thereafter determined that these abilities could only have come from mankind.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
