<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-530</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-530 is to be stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. SCP-530 is to be kept sedated and fed IV fluids at all times. Any personnel approaching SCP-530 must wear opaque body armor, as SCP-530 can cause severe damage to unprotected human anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-530 is a human female, approximately 15 years of age. Its body structure is similar to that of a normal human female. However, SCP-530 does not possess any organs or other anatomical components necessary for the maintenance and functioning of such organs. In addition, SCP-530 possesses the ability to temporarily become transparent at will.</p><p>SCP-530's anomalous nature was discovered during ██████ ██ ████, 1993, when a patrol of Foundation agents alerted others to what initially appeared to be an "anomaly". Upon closer examination, it was determined that the cause of the appearance of this anomaly was in fact SCP-530's anomalous properties. Investigation revealed that SCP-530 had been born with its anomalous properties. When SCP-530 was six years old, it killed its mother in an accidental instance of "transparency", and has since been sedated by Foundation agents on a daily basis so as to prevent further damage to public health.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
