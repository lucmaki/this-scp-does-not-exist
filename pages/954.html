<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-954</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-954 is to be stored in a standard Safe-class locker at Site ██. The door of the locker is to be locked and keyed personnel must wear a Level 3 Security Clearance for access to SCP-954. No more than two D-Class personnel are to be allowed within ten (10) meters of SCP-954 at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-954 is an audio device of unknown type, with the appearance of a steel pipe with a 3/4″ threaded end. SCP-954 is capable of producing any audible frequency ranging between [REDACTED]. It is highly resistant to damage and can withstand temperatures in excess of 2500°C. SCP-954's operation is non-random and its compositions have not been revealed. It only appears to function when connected to a pre-existing musical instrument or musical system, as well as any other device which uses audio playback.</p><p>When connected to a musical instrument or speaker, SCP-954 will emit a constant sound consistent with the original audio signal used by said instrument or speaker. Additionally, SCP-954 will produce no sound during silence and sudden pauses in the playback of music. The only exception to either of these conditions is if music played through SCP-954 comes to an abrupt halt; this will cause the sound produced by SCP-954 to increase in volume for several seconds before returning to normal levels.</p><p>SCP-954's anomalous properties are further extended when it is used with a mechanical device such as a clock or calculator, which will enable it to play any desired melody while simultaneously counting time. This means that it can be used to play one's favorite song or jazz piece while doing calculations on one's homework, creating an unusual source of entertainment on top of its SCP status.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
