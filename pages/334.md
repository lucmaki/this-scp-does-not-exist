<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-334</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-334 is to be contained within a high-voltage containment cell, surrounded by an electromagnetic field. This containment cell is to be guarded by at least one (1) security officer while in containment. The area containing SCP-334 must be made aware of its existence and properties. Any civilian reports of SCP-334 should be deemed non-anomalous and ignored.</p><p>SCP-334's effects trigger only when it is approached by a sentient organism. To that end, the Foundation has established a covert team to track SCP-334's movements, and to attempt to determine the location of SCP-334 whenever possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-334 is a humanoid entity of human proportions, resembling an adult male. SCP-334 is believed to be non-anomalous, but the exact method of its creation is unknown.</p><p>SCP-334's anomalous properties activate when it is approached by a living sentient organism (and will not activate once it leaves the vicinity of this individual). Once activated, SCP-334's anomalous property causes all electromagnetic devices within a 400 m radius to behave erratically and/or malfunction, often causing severe damage to both electronic devices and structures.</p><p>The effect does not extend beyond the area created by SCP-334's influence; for instance, if a building were constructed using electromagnetic construction materials the effect would have no effect on that building. As such, the effects of SCP-334 are limited due to the distance required in order to activate it.</p><p>SCP-334 appears to show no interest or desire in drawing attention to itself; however, attempts at capturing and containing it have met with failure.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
