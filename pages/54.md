<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-54</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-54 is to be contained in a standard containment cell with an additional isolation chamber containing a human subject. Further testing by SCP-54 has been postponed for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-54 appears to be a 17th Century ink and red seal letter written by the noted French scholar Pierre de Beaune. The message indicates that the author is sending SCP-54 in order to secure a position within the Palatinate of the Electorate of the Rhine. The contents of SCP-54 are as follows:</p><p>with this my heart, I announce you my desire to work useful here at the court of Cologne. I am [deleted] and 20 years old, and have already worked in Strasbourg and Mainz, but I don't know what all the dificulties that you can encounter with the Electorate.</p><p>I know I've said it repeatedly, but it is true that I need more experience, because otherwise I will not be able to give my entire attention to success in your highnesses' service.</p><p>The job I ask for merely has to exist: what we do is collect money from wealthy individuals (that's our ticket!). And from there we distribute it to different noble families, as well as filling countless coffers under the name of taxes (we can also literally empty them). It's a very lucrative business! But then again, being with nobility brings its own problems - they're always suspicious of anyone new.</p><p>And so far so good. But if I don't find a better place soon then I will have no other choice than going back home. That is why it's important that you answer this letter quickly.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
