<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-48</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-48 is contained in a standard Safe object containment unit located at Site-88. Current equipment requirements for SCP-48 include life support and an acoustic dampening system. SCP-48's room has been modified to provide a flat, smooth floor. Following its original acquisition, personnel are instructed to avoid the area of most recent damage caused by SCP-48. Personnel with sensitive hearing should refrain from entering SCP-48's containment chamber at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-48 is a black, humanoid entity measuring 1.5 m (5 ft) in height. While not appearing to be animate, SCP-48 shows a hostile reaction whenever it is observed. SCP-48 is largely fluid and fusiform in its appearance, but exhibits appendages at the ends of arms and legs that appear to be made of an indestructible material and are described as "marbles." These appendages, as well as SCP-48's torso and head, appear to be composed entirely of glass. SCP-48 is completely immobile despite being able to detect motion around it.</p><p>Observation of SCP-48's appendages has shown them to attach themselves to objects that are struck with enough force. Once attached, SCP-48 will then use its appendages to manipulate whatever object it was attached to for up to 3 minutes before detaching. The manipulation can be performed in several different ways, including the following:</p><p>SCP-48's anomalous properties manifest whenever an individual strikes itself with force typically greater than 35 kg (75 lb). Subjects who suffer severe injuries are usually observed with one or more appendages detached from their bodies, often resulting in amputation. Despite this damage, subjects report no pain following movement. Subjects claim that the detachment is completely painless and instantaneous, often lasting mere seconds following contact with themselves.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
