<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-659</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the extreme impracticality of containing SCP-659, it has been neutralized. The cable that SCP-659 was connected to has been removed and destroyed, and the area is to be cleaned of any traces of SCP-659.</p><p>SCP-659 has not shown up again since its neutralization, and no further incidents are currently predicted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-659 was a cable, consisting of a transparent plastic tube with a three-pin connector at the end. SCP-659's weight was not large enough to require more than one person to remove.</p><p>Upon removal of SCP-659, the cable has shown a tendency to "unravel". This is indicated by it breaking apart into a black threadlike wire, which then pulls itself out of the cable, much like an eraser pulling out of a pencil.</p><p>Once removed from the cable, SCP-659 will attempt to reform itself and reattach itself to any surface. It is currently unknown how this can be done without assistance from another object or subject.</p><p>When attached to something, SCP-659 will attempt to connect with other cables resting there. If no other cables are present, SCP-659 will wrap itself around the object it is connected to, similar in behavior to string or wire wrapping around an object. If another cable is present within its coils, it will pull itself through the other cables and attempt to reconnect with them. When multiple cables are present, SCP-659 will begin pulling itself through all of them at once until it is interrupted or breached by anything outside its environment.</p><p>If forced through an anomaly (e.g., a wall of solid concrete), SCP-659 will simply dematerialize upon breaching the barrier. It has been shown that it is capable of passing through most barriers that force a dematerialization (including steel sheets and reinforced concrete). On rare occasions, SCP-659 has become stuck inside of spatial anomalies such as a temporal anomaly or fourth-dimensional space; however, even if not explorable by normal means (i.e., removing obstructions), it has always been able to dematerialize into a normal space unharmed (this includes being trapped within multidimensional spaces).</p><p>After first appearing in 1999 in Singapore (who discovered it after the death of [REDACTED], owner of a record store), SCP-659 would continually appear via spontaneous manifestation in various areas worldwide until 2009 when its anomalous properties were discovered and neutralized in New York City; it would later be neutralized in Washington DC on 10/13/2014.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
