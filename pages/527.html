<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-527</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All sources of SCP-527 are kept in Containment Locker 77. A full list of the known sources of SCP-527 can be found in Document 527-01. All subjects affected by SCP-527 are to be kept in Observation Locker 4. A full list of subjects affected by SCP-527 can be found in Document 527-03.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-527 is a phenomenon affecting any recorded media that has recently been removed from its original container and replaced with an alternate container. The effect of SCP-527 manifests when a subject viewing the affected media attempts to view the first piece of it after SCP-527. When SCP-527 is affecting media such as film, television or computer disks, the subject's perception of the object immediately after viewing it will be corrupted, causing them to claim to be viewing a completely different object.</p><p>After approximately one minute of viewing an affected object, a secondary effect occurs in the subject who viewed the affected object. The age of the primary effects are shown below:</p><p>Exposure to these effects will result in the following symptoms being caused by the subject:</p><p>Due to the severe psychological effect that occurs when a subject is affected by SCP-527, under no circumstances are they permitted to be used for testing purposes except in special circumstances. Nevertheless, they are still required to undergo mandatory psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>Subjects affected by SCP-527 display behavior consistent with these symptoms depending on the age of exposure. Subjects exposed prior to their fourteenth birthday will demonstrate behavior consistent with symptoms before this time. For example, if a subject believes they have seen Batman before they have seen any other superhero, they will demonstrate psychological trauma due to this belief and delusional thinking regarding Batman. Other symptoms will vary depending on how old the subject was when they were exposed to SCP-527.</p><p>Most subjects currently under Foundation custody experiencing SCP-527 exhibit several visual hallucinations at once, and as such are not able to determine what caused their symptoms until after all hallucinations have disappeared. However, most subjects can recall their exposure taking place at several points throughout their lives. All instances of SCP-527 were introduced into human populations through mass media displayed primarily through television networks today.[1]</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
