<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-535</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of ██/██/████ all SCP-535 instances are to be monitored via CCTV in Site-03. When the number of instances has reached 200, activation of missile interceptors is to be initiated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-535 is a collection of 200 to 300 crystalline structures, the approximate size, mass and form of 1-meter cubes. The structures are able to move by opposing gravity, maintaining an angular velocity of 6 meters per second at all times.</p><p>SCP-535 instances act as both structural and structural support for SCP-635, an extradimensional entity contained within. Unlike SCP-635, SCP-535 remains inert unless instances are within 3 meters of it. An active instance makes no attempt to interact with others or influence events outside its immediate vicinity unless directed to do so.</p><p>SCP-535 will attempt to retain the path of any object moving in the same direction as it. If the target object moves in a horizontal path, SCP-535 will move in a vertical one until it reaches the target's eye level. If it cannot reach its target's eyes, SCP-535 will continue to move in the same direction as its target until it is within approximately 5 meters of them. In these circumstances, SCP-535 will release a cryogenic gas that causes frostbite on human skin in less than 10 seconds if inhaled; Prolonged exposure can cause frostbite to the lungs if not immediately dealt with.</p><p>When two or more objects are moving either horizontally or vertically at high speed (>200 km/h), SCP-535 instances organise themselves into formations resembling aircraft wings. These formations do not harm each other unless attacked; Instead, they act as containers for instances of SCP-632 and SCP-294 (extradimensional entities).</p><p>All instances carry a large amount of polyesters in their bodies; Humans who consume polyesters from a nonanomalous source often experience mild euphoria and fatigue shortly afterward. This effect can be amplified when polyesters are ingested through the oral cavity.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
