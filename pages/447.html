<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-447</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-447 is to be kept in a large, sealed storage-type container at Site-16. The item itself is not to be removed from the container, in order to prevent any disruption of the wax coating on its surface.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-447 appears to be an electronic memo pad. The item is, however, coated with wax from end-to-end and top-to-bottom.</p><p>When a human visible at least eight (8) inches away from SCP-447 attempts to write on it, regardless of whether or not the writing is in English, or in any language for that matter, the writing will appear on its surface in the same way as ink would if it were applied by normal means. At no point during the process does the writing alter to seem 'foreign', nor will it change over time.</p><p>All writing done on SCP-447 remains on its surface until the item is returned to its original container; after which, writing done within itself will disappear forever.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
