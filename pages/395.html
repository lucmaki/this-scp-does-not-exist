<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-395</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-395 is to be stored in a locker at Site-██. Containment locker has been modified with a standard biohazard suit carrying case lid as the only opening fit for SCP-395. Samples of SCP-395 are to be stored in a separate storage locker, and are to be inspected regularly by a member of security staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-395 is a mental aid accessory. All that is known of SCP-395 is as follows:</p><p>SCP-395 was discovered in the possession of John ███████, who had claimed to have acquired it at some point between 2/07/1984 and 3/14/1984. He claimed he had no recollection of how he had obtained SCP-395, but believed that he had been given it by a man named Ray █████, who had claimed to be a sailor during World War II (the events described by Ray are not confirmed). John did not recall Ray's name, and only remembered that Ray wore a green uniform. This information corresponds with later reports of SCP-395.</p><p>John ███████ claims to have used SCP-395 on ██ occasions, but cannot remember the name of any individuals involved with these events. The effects of SCP-395 are consistent with the following list:</p><p>By adding another word or phrase to the sentence inside SCP-395's clear shell, the user can activate one of three different functions for their mental aid agent; each function has its own color which matches the original color of SCP-395's shell.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
