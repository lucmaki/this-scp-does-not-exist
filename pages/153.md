<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-153</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-153 is to be located at Site-42, under the guise of a soundproof chamber. The chamber itself is to be located in Sector-E, guarded by one (1) Level 3 security officer and a team of four (4) D-Class personnel. In addition, the chamber itself is to be equipped with an audiovisual system, along with sensors in order to detect disturbances in the area surrounding it.</p><p>SCP-153 may not leave this chamber until further notice from Site Command. Any personnel wishing to practice notes or other musical instruments within the vicinity of SCP-153 are to receive permission from at least two (2) level 3 security staff.</p><p>Permission to practice vocal exercises with SCP-153 has not been granted at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-153 is a large soundproof chamber which produces loud, complex sound waves. These sounds are produced at varying frequencies and can be described as that of a choir singing from multiple octaves above the range of human hearing. When in use, the inhabitants of the chamber will periodically produce loud noises in order to maintain group cohesion.</p><p>SCP-153 is sentient and intelligent, possessing a personality similar to that of a human male of the late twenties with little education. When not in use, the chamber frequently spends its time practicing vocal exercises, ranging from simple melodies to complex harmonies.</p><p>Currently, researchers do not know how SCP-153 manages to accomplish this effect, as there are no speakers within the chamber. The only observable effect has been provided by SCP-152, which is an interface located on the wall behind SCP-153. This interface also appears to show slight signs of life in a very rudimentary manner (running programs or "experiments" in Windows XP). SCP-152 performs these tasks when instructed to do so by SCP-153 or the occupants of the chamber. No reasoning has been found as to how it is able to manipulate this interface.</p><p>During tests observed by personnel who have been issued earplugs, SCP-153 has demonstrated an ability to detect noises from outside the area being tested. However, this does not seem to be related to its use as an amplifier for outside sounds; if a noise is created in one side of the testing area but outside of it, it will not show any type of response from SCP-153 prior to a test being conducted on that area.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
