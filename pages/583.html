<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-583</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-583 is kept in a standard high security SCUBA tank with a small chamber containing objects of cultural significance to the inhabitants of the island of Kofunoshima, Ogura District, Okinawa Prefecture. The tank is to be monitored at all times for leaks or spillage. Should leakage occur, an emergency retrieval team is to establish a containment zone and contain the overflow of SCP-583. Tanks used for testing are to be maintained at the same level of containment as SCP-583.</p><p>A double layer of polyethylene sheeting is to be used during containment, typically when the tank is above water level for cleaning purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-583 is a pale yellow waterborne liquid of unknown composition originating from the island of Kofunoshima, Ogura District, Okinawa Prefecture.</p><p>SCP-583 may be digested in the human stomach and absorbed into the body through skin or lungs. It has been shown to take about three hours for complete absorption, with symptoms appearing approximately four hours after absorption.</p><p>Under normal conditions, SCP-583 causes no long term harm to humans. However, SCP-583 will begin to cause symptoms of severe nausea and vomiting if any amount is ingested at one time. All symptoms appear within six minutes of ingestion, and continue until the level reaches 7mL. This takes about two hours and thirty minutes in total. The symptoms gradually increase in severity until they are equivalent to those of an acute gastric ulcer.</p><p>If left undigested in the stomach for more than thirty minutes without emptying it, SCP-583 will begin to undergo a process known as osmosis. Once a concentration of 1mL has been reached by osmosis, the biological processes involved in digestion automatically cease altogether, causing death within about fifteen minutes.</p><p>SCP-583 was once contained by the Foundation due to its effects on sea life when one of its containment tanks was accidentally breached during maintenance work by personnel with no knowledge of its anomalous properties; subsequent testing has shown that this process is not specific to SCP-583 alone but occurs equally on all waterborne substances introduced into the body simultaneously.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
