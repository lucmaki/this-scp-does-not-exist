<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-911</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-911 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with three (3) solid walls, nooses or loops, and a ceiling of at least 2 m. The floor must be padded and contain no sharp points. The walls are to be reinforced with an apparatus of some kind to keep the subject in place while they administer the task.</p><p>Two (2) armed guards must remain within the containment chamber at all times except when performing tasks as specified in this document. One guard is to remain stationary outside the room holding a radio that can be used for emergency communication once the other guard leaves for 15 minutes. To facilitate this, the guard inside must have access to a recording device capable of storing lengthier tapes.</p><p>The cell is to be kept cold and humidified by means of a humidifier draining into a sump, with the water being replenished daily if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-911 is a sapient, humanoid entity designated SCP-911-1. SCP-911 appears to be a translucent red, green, blue or purple liquid that spontaneously generates surfaces with irregular patterns of goop and gnarls. At least one (1) pair of arms extend from the surface at all times.</p><p>The anomalous properties of SCP-911 are expressed in its method of locomotion. It appears to move by generating "steps" along the surface it occupies. The generated surface moves in the same way as if made up of rigid non-liquid material such as metal, though it can be deformed, broken, and destroyed with great ease. While seemingly deformed and breaking apart, the surface retains a plastic likeness of how it once was before being distorted and destroyed.</p><p>SCP-911 seems to prefer walking on hard flooring when exposed to opportunities for this, although it could be shown moving about the laboratory on any surface provided there was no risk of damage to itself or other entities.</p><p>When presented with an opportunity for movement, subjects under observation will attempt to move about and repeat actions similar to those commonly performed by humanoids like themselves. This observed behavior is replicated by SCP-911 whenever able regardless of its containment situation or current bodily composition.</p><p>This apparent behavior is directly correlated with the time spent in an environment conducive to movement and further activation of SCP-911's anomalous properties until it becomes unable to walk anywhere remaining stationary unless subject is prevented from moving or forced into moving situations.</p><p>SCP-911 has demonstrated the ability to "write" in the air with various illusory motions using its body parts wherever possible instead of attempting to create physical marks upon paper or similar materials. Human subjects observing this are able to read the information written in this manner without assistance from the subject that wrote it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
