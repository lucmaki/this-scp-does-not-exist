<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-456</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-456 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment room, furnished with a table and chair. SCP-456 instances are not to be allowed to remain for more than 24 hours without a staff member being present.</p><p>All incoming correspondence from SCP-456 is to be immediately destroyed by incineration. Any documents or images produced by SCP-456 are to be disposed of as soon as possible using the techniques documented in SCP-1104.</p><p>Any personnel assigned to SCP-456 should be pre-screened for mental illness and/or history of drug abuse. Personnel who have been affected by SCP-456 should undergo treatment following standard Foundation psychological evaluation protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-456 is the designation given to a collective of individuals who display symptoms consistent with anomalous psychopathology. Instances of SCP-456 are typically socially inept, impulsive, and restless.</p><p>While SCP-456 instances exhibit the same abnormality across all age groups and genders, certain personality traits can be anticipated by studying individual cases. While several details remain unknown about the specific causes of these attributes, it is believed that they are innate and not affected by other psychological or medical conditions (see Addendum).</p><p>Because of their low intelligence and repetitive behavior, SCP-456 instances will spend most of their time idly playing games or watching television. However, they may become devastated when they are unable to achieve a goal they set for themselves (see Addendum). Examples of such goals include:</p><p>An SCP-456 instance also tends to feel a sense of pride over any accomplishment (i.e., winning at chess).</p><p>SCP-1104 describes the procedures for destroying documents produced by an SCP-456 instance.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
