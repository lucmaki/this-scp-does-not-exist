<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-272</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to its ability to operate off of an electrical source, System Batteries have been neutralized and replaced with non-electrical batteries. A permanent containment cell has been constructed in Site-██.</p><p>In the event of an emergency breach at Site-██, the entrance to SCP-272 is to be sealed off immediately and small charges implanted throughout the room. Proximity alarms for all areas containing SCP-272 are to be activated in the event that SCP-272 does not remain contained within its cell. A variation of SCP-272, designated SCP-272-A, is to be contained separately under Containment Protocol XXXX-03a and supplied with a standard Service Battery upon discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-272 is a humanoid entity approximately 1.9 meters in height, with pale skin and dark blue eyes. It possesses no discernable gender or sexual characteristics, but appears to be sterile due to the absence of organs associated with reproduction. SCP-272 has the ability to manipulate electrical energy, which it uses to levitate the mass at its center. SCP-272 primarily inhabits containment areas equipped with a battery system, but has been recorded entering homes when power has been cut off.</p><p>SCP-272 primarily communicates through vocalizations, but also is capable of transmitting information through signs. Instances of SCP-272 are known to spontaneously generate within theaters, offices and other situations where an electrical supply exists. Upon being observed, instances of SCP-272 exhibit behaviors typical for humans in similar circumstances. The behavior of these instances changes depending on the location they inhabit; agents have observed common personalities exhibited by instances of SCP-272 include:</p><p>When the "Opposite" personality is present (as defined in Addendum 272-3) the instance displays violent tendencies and attempts to terminate any living beings within its area of influence. In addition, attempts are made to locate and remove all sources of electric equipment.</p><p>While there have been several reports of this behavior occurring at sites where non-anomalous products are produced, efforts have not yet been made to research the source or origins of SCP-272.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
