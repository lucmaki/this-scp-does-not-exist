<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-796</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-796 is to be located in the Communications Wing of Site-██, locked in a secure locker located on site. A standard radio transmitter operable from a distance of 200 meters is to be attached outside SCP-796's containment locker. This transmitter may only be used for testing purposes and is not to emit any signals. Testing with SCP-796 should take place on site.</p><p>Should testing require equipment that needs to be transported to site, two (2) Level 4 staff members are to escort the object at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-796 is a black, plastic box measuring 35cm x 15cm x 15cm (14"x6½"x6½") with an open compartment in the front. The bottom of the case contains an aluminum support that allows the object to be hung from a hook on a wall. The box contains no electronics or circuitry. When SCP-796 emits radio waves at a frequency of 28.35 MHz, it will attempt to establish contact with an individual designated by said individual's last name. Should contact not be made, SCP-796 will retreat into its sealed compartment and attempt to establish contact again when conditions are appropriate.</p><p>Test Log:</p><p>Testing Notes: The following was conducted at Site 84 on 4/11/███, with Dr. ████ posing as subject █████.</p><p>As the test progressed, Dr. ████ reported hearing his name being mentioned several times. Due to the length of time required to complete the test, audio analysis had been completed by the time of reporting, with low-frequency ultrasonic analysis showing that the subject's first name was being spoken by the object, while his surname and last name were being spoken by Dr. ████. Analysis of voice patterns showed that there appear to be two separate speakers using identical language patterns, with one female and one male speaker. (See Audio log.)</p><p>At 21:27:22, Subject [REDACTED] entered Site 84 and began talking to [REDACTED]. As Subject [REDACTED] turned his back towards Dr. ████ to answer a call on his cell phone, he asked Dr. ████ if he could talk through SCP-796. He was prompted to place a piece of paper inside SCP-796's container for approximately thirty seconds before noticing it had already fallen out when he opened it again and asked what happened; when told that he had not "dirtied" SCP-796, he became visibly upset and returned to the communications room for discussion purposes. At this point, Dr. ████ noted odd background noise similar to a radio or television playing in the distance outside Site 84's perimeter fence; it grew stronger as both subjects spoke over SCP-796's radio transmitter until they disappeared off site at 21:30:08 and 21:30:17 respectively.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
