<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-414</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Amnestics have proven ineffective at erasing the memory of SCP-414 from all actors. Retaining the testimony of an individual to show them the object's anomalous properties has proven more effective at lessening their knowledge of its actuality.</p><p>SCP-414 is currently housed in a heavy security containment cell at Site-██ for several reasons, including:</p><p>Any personnel still aware of SCP-414's true nature are to be administered Class-A amnestics and re-assigned to sensitive positions or no position.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-414 is a billiards table with 4 balls and a cue stick. The side of the table opposite the cue stick has been modified to allow for unobstructed vision of the participant’s body.</p><p>Anyone sitting at SCP-414 is capable of manipulating the exact arrangement of their body parts at will, regardless of their physical properties. They are able to make themselves seem either taller or shorter, thinner or fatter, and in any combination. In addition, they can cause their limbs or other body parts to move in ways impossible for mass constructs or even inanimate objects. For example, one subject was observed to make his head spin rapidly while the rest of his body (ignoring the head) remained still, demonstrating that he could move his head independently of his body. After this subject had finished manipulating his body, it reverted to its usual state and became inert once again; it was theorized that if he had stopped manipulating his body at this point, he would have reverted back to his usual state and been unable to manipulate his body again. Subjects were not affected by SCP-414's anomalous properties if they were occupying a different area of the same room; thus, subjects within a room but not physically touching SCP-414 were unaffected by its property, but if placed with one or more subjects who were physically touching the device, all subjects would be affected by it. If one or more subjects exited the room from which they were physically touching SCP-414, their anomalous properties would cease as soon as they left the room behind them; thus subjects could use SCP-414's properties to create illusory versions of themselves and then leave them behind so as to fake their own death as well as having enough time for SCP-414 to revert back to its inactive state once they had completed whatever task they had been performing with it. In addition factoring in both potential deaths caused by prolonged exposure to SCP-414's anomalous properties and potentially dangerous medical conditions caused by prolonged manipulation of an individual's organs whilst under the effects of SCP-414’s anomalous properties, it is currently believed that only 1 human subject can be affected at any given time by SCP-414 at Site-██.</p><p>If one or more subjects are not seen interacting with SCP-412 after dealing with these issues, researchers should assume they have died under unknown circumstances and report this fact immediately; if possible, attempts should be made to retrieve their bodies and research specimens without allowing documentation of their death.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
