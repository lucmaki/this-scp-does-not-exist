<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-875</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> </p><p>Operation: All SCP-875 is to be contained in a standard secured aircraft hanger. Air temperature is to be maintained at 75°F with relative humidity at 75%. All work involving SCP-875 is to be conducted in uniformed guard uniforms. A motion sensor has been installed to monitor for unauthorized access to the hanger during routine maintenance. Personnel authorized to interact with SCP-875 must wear flame-retardant coveralls and respirator masks.</p><p>Outdoor experimentation requires written approval from Dr. ██████. No other personnel are to be present when testing occurs outside the facility's hanger.</p><p>All research involving SCP-875 must be carried out in the presence of Agent ████ and two other agents as required by basic safety protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-875 appears to be a pair of twin-engine A-6E Intruder attack planes. SCP-875 displays no anomalous properties when under its own power, but will immediately take off when a pair of propellers are connected to it (See test logs). SCP-875 moves at speeds typically equivalent to those of an aircraft powered solely by a single machine gun. The total scale of SCP-875's propulsion is not currently understood.</p><p>All recorded information regarding the origin and purpose of SCP-875 is as follows:</p><p>Name: ████████ B-28A Bodney NAS</p><p>Serial: ██120463</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
