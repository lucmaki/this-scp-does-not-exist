<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-621</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All known accounts of SCP-621 are to be gathered and all attempts to locate SCP-621 are to be blocked. Attempts at locating the initial point of discovery are currently underway.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-621 has the outward appearance of a normal propellor lawn mower with a combined horsepower rating of approximately 60 hp. On the inner surface of SCP-621's blade, however, is a system of hidden gears and pulleys that allow SCP-621 to propel itself at speeds of up to 130 km/h. SCP-621 is also capable of hovering in one place for indefinite periods of time, using its built-in jet propulsion.</p><p>SCP-621 is able to communicate through an unknown process with a small number (██) of individuals initially discovered by it through human encounters at random points throughout the United States . Messages relayed by SCP-621 are often recorded by witnesses. Because of this, Foundation researchers have been unable to conclusively decrypt SCP-621's messages in any way.</p><p>When forcibly separated from humans during its hovered state, SCP-621 will attempt to return to them as soon as possible. If it is unable to do so, it will begin lobbying Foundation personnel on how they should be dealt with. It has demonstrated the ability to bribe Foundation agents, threaten them by death or dismemberment if they resist, and even convince them to attack each other instead of attempting to remove SCP-621. The method used varies depending on whether SCP-621 has been separated from its initial point of discovery; after being separated more than three times, instances will only behave violently if physically prevented from returning.</p><p>In order to prevent further loss of life due to SCP-621's influence (as well as avoid damage to Foundation facilities), all attempts at location should be blocked until containment is complete.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
