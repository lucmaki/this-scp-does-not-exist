<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-107</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-107 is to be contained within a sealed containment unit at Site-27. Introductions to human subjects are prohibited; personnel handling SCP-107 should wear full hazmat suits and respirators at all times.</p><p>The air in the containment unit is to be filtered and must not exceed 7 µm PMMA particle size. The edepositor supplied with SCP-107 should be sterilized via gamma irradiation at least once every three years. Any waste water from the sterilization process must be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-107 is a set of stencils and a small plastic cup. The stencils are both etched with the letter "A" (henceforth referred to as SCP-107-A). It is currently unknown how these items were produced, but it is believed they were manufactured in the late 1970s or early 1980s.</p><p>When mixed with paint, either water-based or solvent-based, SCP-107 creates "Bitrooper Paint." When dried and cured, Bitrooper Paint has the same visual properties as real bituminous paint (primarily being opaque), but can be reused thousands of times without degradation.</p><p>SCP-107 was first discovered by Foundation agent ██████ ████████ during the Araida family's home remodeling project. Agent ██████ had been attempting to track down a workman who had been using Foundation property to create anomalous materials on a regular basis. After interviewing the workman and conducting some basic research into his methods, Agent ██████ discovered that SCP-107 had been used in another construction project earlier in the year.</p><p>Further investigation into the second area revealed that SCP-107 had been used in order to recreate an underground portion of SCP-106's basement. Testing has since determined that SCP-107 has no anomalous properties when used externally; only when put into use on an object existing within SCP-106's primary anomaly's space.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
