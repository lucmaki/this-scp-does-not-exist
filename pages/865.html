<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-865</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-865 is kept in a standard containment locker, located at Site-██. It is to be monitored for any signs of movements or damage, at all times.</p><p>Any personnel involved in the maintenance of SCP-865 are to be wearing protective eyewear while they are nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-865 is a storage locker located in an abandoned police station that can only be accessed through a fire escape. Its interior, which resembles that of a typical dentist office, contains approximately 1.3 containers of various teeth and bones inside of it.</p><p>SCP-865 was found in the possession of Hannah ███████, who was arrested three weeks prior to this incident due to the discovery of several human remains in her apartment. According to information available, Ms. ███████ was frequently seeing a therapist, resulting in SCP-865's discovery by the police. She had been using the items in SCP-865 as part of a makeshift magic circle of sorts. The items were later confiscated due to their suspicious and unusual nature.</p><p>During a containment breach on █/█/20██, security footage revealed that Ms. ███████ constantly checked the items of SCP-865 throughout the night prior to the incident. It is also notable that she would periodically open and close SCP-865 for unknown reasons. During this time, several human body parts began appearing from within its interior; however, after Ms. ███████ entered her bedroom, these body parts would vanish from sight. The police soon entered her room after several complaints about her unkempt living conditions, but were unable to find any evidence regarding any missing body parts or other abnormalities, according to the reports filed by local authorities.</p><p>However, after determining that Ms. ███████ had killed herself with her own handgun following this incident and that her case had been closed, investigators found no record of such incidents occurring at all.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
