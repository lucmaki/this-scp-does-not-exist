<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-23</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-23 is kept in a reinforced containment case at Site 77, with further security measures as detailed in Document 23-2. SCP-23 is to be kept under constant observation and recorded on D-Class personnel at least every hour.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-23 is a wooden facsimile of the Solvay telescope, used to search for extraterrestrial intelligent life in space. The original Solvay telescope is located in the International Space Station. When an intelligent extraterrestrial life form is discovered, the image of SCP-23 will be transmitted to an orbiting satellite and then back to Earth.</p><p>SCP-23 retains no anomalous properties other than the image transmission. It has been tested repeatedly with non-anomalous versions of the original solvay telescope and all have produced identical results. Testing with different locations on Earth and in space have yielded identical results for SCP-23's anomalous functionality.</p><p>Automatic telescopes displaying SCP-23 are being installed at major astronomical observatories around the world to assist field personnel in identifying inhabited extraterrestrial planets if they are found by current technology.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
