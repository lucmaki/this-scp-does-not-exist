<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-449</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All known fragments of SCP-448 are to be recovered, studied and any suspected instances of SCP-448-A identified and contained. Foundation assets are largely restricted to scientific research and public relations of the economic benefits of containment of SCP-448.</p><p>Full documentation of all active Foundation recovery teams is restricted to Clearance 4 or above. Recovery efforts should be staged in such a way as to minimize civilian casualties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-448 is a large anomalous object, estimated to be approximately 60 km tall. The object appears to consist of a mass of amorphous material resembling tungsten carbide.</p><p>While SCP-448's structure and composition are not known, it is estimated to weight at least 1.2×10^30 tons.</p><p>SCP-448's primary effect is that it continually causes economic growth (hereafter referred to as SCP-448-A) in human society. In case of multiple instances of SCP-448 in the same location, the SCP will only affect one instance at a time; multiple instances in the same location may cause SCP-448 to become unstable.</p><p>The rate of growth produced by SCP-448 varies, but is generally between 3% and 12% annually depending on the region in which it resides. Anomalous effects have been observed with almost all world economies, including Iceland and Japan. However, production of SCP-448 tends to occur in areas with high population densities and a lack of natural resources. Currently, no regions are known to have an active SCP-448 anomaly, though several countries show signs of increased prosperity due to the presence of other active anomalies.</p><p>SCP-448 will remain stable until all fragments are safely contained or it ruptures. While containment efforts have been limited due to its massive size, no breaches are known to have occurred as of yet.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
