<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-166</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The artifact is to be guarded under constant video surveillance at Site-64. All research on the artifact is to be carried out through Site-64's legitimate library, which is to be completely separate from the artifact itself. The staff of Site-64 are to be given class C amnestics upon entering the containment wing of SCP-166. Any personnel who leave Site-66 and enter a Foundation Site are to be considered as having been captured by SCP-166.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-166 is an artifact with the appearance of a 33 cm x 24 cm photograph. The back of the paper is blank, but the front bears various logos, all of which appear to be connected to a company named APS Photo. SCP-166's anomalous effects become active when it is placed in a camera.</p><p>SCP-166 will then activate its anomalous effect to slowly change the images displayed from that picture. Initially, this will begin with very minor changes, such as straightening of perspective or slight additions or removals of objects from the background. As time progresses and more people come into contact with the picture, these changes will become increasingly severe. For example, a person who looks at the image will begin to see their head dissolving and separating into individual particles, while a second would see the particles taking on human proportions. This effect will continue until something takes place with the picture, such as disposing of it.</p><p>If SCP-166 is taken directly from camera to camera instead of being kept in storage, it will also gradually change its appearance over time. However, if any other object is placed into the photo itself before taking it away again (such as holding it up to another camera), SCP-166's ability to change photographs ceases entirely. Attempts have been made to take a photo of SCP-166 itself; however, this appears to have no discernible effect on the object itself.</p><p>SCP-166 was discovered by Agent ████ after he observed two male subjects approaching his office during an investigation into anomalies occurring within Site-66 for several hours without leaving. Upon questioning them about their whereabouts, they had no memory of their behavior and claimed that they were not aware that SCP-166 had been there for some time despite having been working on it. Agent ████ managed to secure a copy of SCP-166 from them and later reported this artifact along with others found related to SCP-972 and SCP-173 to Dr Januszpork1 at Site-64 through Headquarters Security Department 5 ("HSD").</p><p></p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
