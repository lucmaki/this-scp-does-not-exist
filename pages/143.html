<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-143</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Newcomer</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-143 is currently contained at Site-11, and is subject to a bi-weekly blood donation. In addition, a single Geiger counter is to be placed in the containment chamber during each cycle of renovation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-143 is a mass currently composed of approximately two (2) gallons of human blood, and is in the form of a roughly 12 ft long, six (6) foot tall, and three (3) foot wide humanoid figure. The SCP-143's main body is composed of mostly red blood cells, with a lighter yellow complexion on the head, hands, and feet. SCP-143 shows no signs of aging other than the occasional discoloration of blood due to exposure to air.</p><p>SCP-143 appears almost entirely biologically intact with the exception of its spine, which has been surgically removed, and internal organs have been replaced with various mechanical components.</p><p>SCP-143's internal mechanisms are as follows:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
