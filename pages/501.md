<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-501</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-501 is to be held in a standard containment locker, located in Site-19. It is to be provided with a variety of materials and toys, but no items are to be brought into the testing chamber or placed on the pedestal. The cost of one month's worth of food rations will be deducted from its current value at the end of each month.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-501 is a stackable Magic: The Gathering card game deck, and is currently comprised of 52 black-bordered cards divided among five different types:</p><p>SCP-501 was purchased in 1987 for $12.95 at a "Uncle's Games" store, located in [REDACTED], Washington, USA. SCP-501 does not bear any distinguishing marks or labels on the outside of the packaging. SCP-501 exhibits no anomalous properties when examined under non-anomalous magnification, and will draw no attention to itself when viewed by an average human under normal conditions; however, if SCP-501 is viewed while its pedestal is covered with any sort of cloth (such as a handkerchief), photocopied cards, or other materials, it will activate and become animate. In this state, SCP-501 will attempt to steal any item placed upon its pedestal; these items range from pens to papers to clothes to playing cards to a small stone carving of a dragon. If the pedestal remains undisturbed for more than 30 minutes, SCP-501 will return to its inactive state. However, if moved with sufficient force or reoriented, it will remain animated indefinitely</p><p>When SCP-501 is animated, it will attempt to find another instance of SCP-501 made from paper or fabric based off of the same set of rules. This process begins anew every time SCP-501 is animated. Comparison shows that the number of possible combinations available are far greater than the number of possible decks; however, as each instance of SCP-501 has been created through different methods (card shuffling vs. actual play) and by different people, little information has been gathered about how this process occurs.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
