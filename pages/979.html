<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-979</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-979 is to be kept in a standard containment unit at Site-73. SCP-979 is to be fed twice daily, and given its own bedding, as well as a full suit of basic armor. The chamber itself should be cleaned twice daily, and SCP-979's food is to be replaced every day.</p><p>SCP-979 is to be placed under the care of Dr. ██████████, who is to oversee all testing involving SCP-979 and any potential subjects. SCP-979 is not allowed outside of its containment unit under any circumstances, except for the testing chambers that must be built for each test. Any staff with an interest in magic are to be denied access to SCP-979, as are any individuals capable of performing magic. Any researcher attempting to perform a spell on SCP-979 regardless of attempts to keep them away will be treated as a hostile subject, and will be terminated immediately by all personnel involved.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-979 is a humanoid figure, approximately two meters tall and weighing approximately 150 kg. It has pale white skin and black hair, which is mostly pulled back into a ponytail. Its eyes are black and its mouth is always slightly open. Its clothes consist of a black hooded cloak, with a silver trim on the edges, as well as loose fitting pants that are tan in color. SCP-979 has no visible ears or nose, so the only way to determine its gender is by its voice. SCP-979 has claimed to be female when asked by researchers.</p><p>SCP-979 is capable of performing an unknown form of magic, without the use of any tools or spellbooks. It speaks English fluently, and can produce written language as well. SCP-979 claims to be able to find answers to any question it is asked by anyone who knows magic. Any given subject may ask questions of SCP-979, or make requests for aid. SCP-979 will respond in a manner that seems appropriate to their personality type, and will attempt to fulfill the request or question they were given.</p><p>SCP-979 was recovered in ████, ████ after the Foundation acquired an eyewitness account of it killing a man named █████████████ ████████ ███ in what seemed like an impossible manner. The Foundation recovered SCP-979 from the scene and took it under their control. Further investigation revealed that Mr. ████████ had actually been killed by his own daughter, who had been taught how to use magic by her estranged husband and his friends before fleeing from him and joining the Foundation's ranks. She was later interrogated by Foundation personnel and found to have been using magic to commit crimes against her father's company in order to obtain money for her personal use.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
