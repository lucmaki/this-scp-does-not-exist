<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-50</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to monitor any and all sightings of SCP-50. Further information will be processed by the technical division.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-50 is a fleet of ███ unidentified vehicles, which all display characteristics of an off-road military grade vehicle. Any attempts to gain information about the drivers or designation of origin have failed.</p><p>SCP-50 appears as a fleet of five vehicles. A large object resembling a bus or monorail is located at the front of the fleet, containing all crew members. The vehicles of SCP-50 vary between models and styles, with different models in the fleet having different model numbers and names. All units are human-operated and were originally used by a private company, USA Transport Corporation.</p><p>SCP-50 is considered non-anomalous as it has been observed in various parts of the world, including Russia and Mongolia. The Foundation is currently investigating where such vehicles originated from.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
