<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-930</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-930 is to be kept in a secure locker in the Site-19 armory. Any personnel wishing to set foot in the containment chamber are to be briefed on the object's anomalous properties and remain in safe proximity at all times. In the event that SCP-930 is used for any manner of testing, precautions must be made to prevent its escape and presentation of said results to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-930 is a helium filled, white, rubberized balloon with a circumference of approximately 5 m. SCP-930 is composed of two sections; a gray interior and an exterior made of a yellow latex paint. The latex paint has apparently been applied in strips and is continuously being torn off at the seams. On the outside, several markings are present:</p><p>The purpose of these markings is currently unknown, though it is theorized that they were created by one or more individuals prior to its containment. SCP-930's volume was measured at 4.6 m after it was inflated using air in containment chamber 824 (see Incident Report). The interior of SCP-930 is composed mostly of what appears to be random pieces of paper, dried out clothing and a partial plastic toy car. Besides this, there is little notable data on the object aside from what can be gathered visually.</p><p>After being used on five separate occasions since being discovered on ██/██/19██, SCP-930 has shown itself to be highly adaptable and cooperative when utilized by Foundation personnel. It has demonstrated a dislike for being deflated and reacted violently prior to its rediscovery when interrupted during inflation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
