<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-291</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-291 has been stored in an abandoned warehouse in ████████, CA. It is to be kept on a constant temperature of 4°C, with the air circulation system on during the day and turned off at night. The door to the enclosure is made of steel, with a force of over 1000 kgps when closed. This can be tested using no more than 15 kg of force applied to it from outside the enclosure; any greater force will cause it to open from the inside. This area must be monitored at all times for possible breaches.</p><p>Ventilation is to be controlled by an air conditioning system, as well as a system for checking for leaks in the roof.</p><p>Any personnel wishing to enter SCP-291's containment area are to wear at least 8 layers of clothing, including long sleeves and pants, socks, boots and gloves, and must sign an online waiver before entering.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-291 is a battered ████ automobile, with an unspecified manufacture date. Its engine is in unknown condition, and repairs are to be done by the nearest garage. Only one wheel is functional at this time. The left headlight and right tail light are missing, as well as the door on the passenger side, as well as plastic break lights on the driver's side front. Much of the paint has been scratched off.</p><p>SCP-291 cannot be entered without being online, and will not enter sleep mode unless it is plugged into an outlet. When plugged into an outlet, SCP-291 is unable to enter sleep mode; however, it can still be used for charging electronic devices such as cell phones.</p><p>When entering sleep mode, SCP-291 will move under its own power to any place that is within range of the outlet that SCP-291 is plugged into. It does this consistently every night at 5:00 AM Pacific Standard Time. SCP-291 attempts to sleep in a place that has had enough sleeping material available for it to find; thus far it hasn't failed in this regard. Additionally, when SCP-291 wakes up from sleep mode, it notices a large amount of sleeping people nearby and veers towards them until it reaches the first available outlet upon which it can recharge.</p><p>While SCP-291 has been kept within Foundation custody for over █ years at this point, no further anomalous events have occurred aside from its nightly behavior. Future containment may require additional measures to curb any potential harm that may come from SCP-291's only behavior pattern.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
