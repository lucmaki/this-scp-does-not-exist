<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-788</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-788 is currently restrained within a soundproof containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber's interior is fitted with two seismic sensors (type SSE-21) which monitor the motion of SCP-788. These sensors are adjusted to detect irregular seismic activity within twenty seconds of SCP-788's movement. As SCP-788 does not respond to any stimuli, no attempts have been made to break or remove its appendages.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-788 appeared in the basement of a ████████ home on 5/3/████. It has since been identified by a variety of common features, such as a missing left arm, an enlarged right foot, a prosthetic left hand, and an artificial left hip. However, it lacks a vocal apparatus and behaves in a manner consistent with a non-anomalous instance of SCP-788. Although it claims to be an "artificial life form", SCP-788 does not appear to exhibit any anomalous properties other than the inability to communicate verbally.</p><p>SCP-788 consistently objects to being contained in its current state, claiming that its current appearance is only a temporary measure until it can obtain real limbs and organs. Notably, despite its status as an SCP object, attempts have been made to reach out and grasp SCP-788's appendages. No recorded instance of SCP-788 removing its appendages or replacing them with new ones has yet occurred; however, it has been observed to apply adhesive tape and electrical tape to parts of both appendages if they appear damaged or worn.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
