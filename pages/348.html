<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-348</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> ██ guards ("The Clowns") are detailed to patrol the perimeter of SCP-348, checking for instances of SCP-348 and a state of childlike fear. They are to be armed with high-caliber firearms, and are to report any young children who attempt to enter SCP-348, or those who show signs of distress. Any instance of SCP-348 they discover is to be suspended until SCP-348 is contained.</p><p>Public strangeness has led to the creation of the MoCo (Middle Class Concern) Task Force, which has been assigned with overseeing SCP-348's containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-348 is an abandoned apartment located at ████ ████ ████████. It appears to have been demolished over the past five years, and has not been occupied since ████. SCP-348 was previously owned by Mr. ██████, who died from a sudden heart attack in his sleep in 1983. When the Foundation acquired SCP-348 in 1981, no anomalous properties were noted until 1981.1981 Addendum A</p><p>On March 7th, 1981, an instance of SCP-348 reappeared outside ██████ Hospital, which was previously the location of SCP-348's previous containment, after being mistaken for a child in need of medical attention by Dr. █████, who was on her way home after working graveyard shift at ██████ Hospital. Dr. █████ responded to the call and discovered SCP-348s standing at attention behind a police barricade around the square near the hospital. A Foundation investigation was launched shortly after this incident, and led to the eventual discovery of SCP-348's real nature. The following incident took place within two minutes of the first instance of SCP-348 appearing outside the hospital:</p><p>Dr. █████: "Yo! Can I help you?"</p><p>SCP-348: "You're not supposed to be here!"</p><p>Dr. █████: "Uh… okay? Why don't –"</p><p>SCP-348: "We're called 'Clowns!' And you are not supposed to be here! You should run away now!"</p><p>(Cuts out for several seconds)</p><p>Dr. █████: "Uh… okay… uh… what's wrong?"</p><p>SCP-348: "We're going to put on a good show! You're not supposed to be here!"</p><p>[From here, SCP-348 presses its body against that of Dr. █████.]</p><p>Dr. █████: "Well… you're right." (Note: Dr. █████ is only identified as male because SCP-348 seems incapable of distinguishing between genders.)</p><p>SCP-348: "You've got to go now! Goodbye!" <End Log></p><p>(Note: Dr. █████ was making his way out of town on foot when he tripped and fell into a ditch.) After Dr. █████ reported this incident immediately, an MTF team was dispatched across town and arrived at the location within 20 minutes.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
