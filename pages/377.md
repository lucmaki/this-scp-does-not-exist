<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-377</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-377's activity is to be monitored 24/7 in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Foundation agents are to monitor SCP-377's body and mind for any changes, and inform of the results as soon as possible to prevent any unknown alteration from occuring. The body of SCP-377 is currently stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-77.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-377 is a male human, approximately 35 years of age. SCP-377's physical appearance is significantly altered from its natural form, being 19 cm taller and possessing a large build that is disproportionate to its young age.</p><p>SCP-377 can be referred to as a 'machinist' or 'mechanic' by external parties due to the artifacts and machines constantly located in its possession. These machines are mostly found in various stages of disassembly and repair, and are generally under-maintained; SCP-377 has been observed repairing these objects without difficulty. SCP-377 also carries around many tools stemming from the early 1900s, including a winch and saw.</p><p>When SCP-377 is active, several portable buildings, towers, and other structures are formed out of scrap or newly found items such as wood and metal. This occurs with great speed and precision, and it is currently unknown how long it takes for SCP-377 to construct these structures.</p><p>SCP-377 constructs most of these structures at random locations, but will seldom return home before each construction is completed. When returned home, SCP-377 usually claims that the construction was completed with no specific instructions other than "Build this". The reason for this is currently unknown.</p><p>When not in use or otherwise occupied with other work, SCP- 377 shows no other interest in mechanical devices or construction than the daily maintenance required for them. It relies on the care of others more than anything else when directly interacting with their design or maintenance, showing a high level of selflessness and humility when doing so.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
