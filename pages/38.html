<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-38</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-38 is an integrated part of the worldwide financial system and efforts to isolate it are mostly irrelevant. The Foundation has the power of financial regulation, but its most effective use seems to be limited to preventing the citizenry from learning about SCP-38's existence. Environmental factors such as specific local economic conditions, climate and demography have been shown to have a significant impact on the credit rating of local institutions.</p><p>The Foundation takes care to ensure that SCP-38 does not gain too much influence over national politics. While SCP-38 is tasked with regulating itself and is overseen by the Bank for International Settlements, any attempts by SCP-38 to reshape national banking policies are resisted by the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-38 is an integrated system of numerous financial institutions, known as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. The BIS was founded in 1930 to administer the gold standard after its collapse during World War II. When an individual or institution seeks debt with a BIS-member entity, SCP-38 automatically assesses their credit worthiness. If the individual or institution is rated as having a sufficient "credit rating", SCP-38 will provide them with a loan of up to 13 times the original balance owed.</p><p>Organizations that are unable to access such loans are denied by SCP-38's automated systems and subject to concerted efforts by Council members and staff at various international banks to bring them into compliance. Individuals who become aware of this process usually notice that their local economy is thriving while national politicians seem powerless to prevent it.</p><p>Most people living in areas where SCP-38 exercises significant influence see this process as an act of providence. However, due to SCP-38's global reach and the normal secrecy surrounding its operations, many have expressed fears about the effects of SCP-38 on local banking systems. Some concerns include:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
