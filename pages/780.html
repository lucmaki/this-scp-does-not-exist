<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-780</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-780 is to be kept in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell. Should SCP-780 enter an empathically mediated state, a standard bedding of coarse grasses is to be placed around it with the addition of 3 liters of fresh water daily. Any sleeping or other noise produced by SCP-780 must be properly muffled, and all attempts to communicate with the subject are to be preemptively terminated by the guards posted for this purpose. The bedding used for SCP-780 is to be rotated once every week.</p><p></p><p>Any breach of containment or exposure incident must be investigated and reported as quickly as possible, given the unusual properties of SCP-780.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-780 is an adult male, currently in its middle years; physically healthy and apparently healthy, but incapable of speech. There are no discernable origin or history to this entity. It is immobile, but it can hum and sing at a moderate pitch. SCP-780's skin bears what appears to be suggestive skin-tight shorts across the lower torso, visible through a mildly torn pair of boxers.</p><p>SCP-780 is extremely sensitive to sound, particularly those in the infrasonic range. Its emotive state fluctuates rapidly and erratically depending on the degree of noise in the room, with a maximum of subjectively normal behavior occurring during quiet periods. SCP-780 will react to more intense shouting, singing and music with agitation, ecstacy and fear.</p><p>Any attempts to penetrate this entity's outer shell of sound produce a shock wave that is felt by multiple individuals several feet away from SCP-780 and continually expands outward until at least one meter of space has been vacated around it. This shock wave will continue to expand as long as SCP-780 continues moving or making noise. The shock waves produced by SCP-780 have not been found to be affected by distance (although the strength does decrease with distance). Additionally, if SCP-780 moves between walls of sufficient height (at present about three meters), the shockwave will not expand beyond their outer edges; despite continuous movement by SCP-780 the shockwave does not 'leak' through these walls.</p><p>All attempts to communicate with SCP-680 have thus far failed due to its passive inability to respond in any manner other than loud humming and singing accompanied by hissing breaths in an incredibly high pitch (>6400 Hz).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
