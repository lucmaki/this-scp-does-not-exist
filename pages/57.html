<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-57</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A small containment tank has been constructed to hold SCP-57. A remote camera has been installed in the tank, and a steel grate has been affixed over the top of the tank preventing entry by any form of dangerous sea creature.</p><p>SCP-57 is to be fed cooked meals at regular intervals, and water is to be provided via a water spigot. Personnel are prohibited from swimming in or observing the testing chamber when SCP-57 is present, as aggressive behavior has resulted in damage to laboratory equipment and personnel.</p><p>Any questions regarding SCP-57 are to be directed to Dr. Harry Suitor, Research Lead.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-57 is a small anemone-like organism, approximately 2 cm in diameter, with a single eye in the center of its body. SCP-57 shows no signs of growth or development, and only one tentacle protrudes from the gas bladder at all times. SCP-57 does not appear to age, and does not show any symptoms of injury or disease.</p><p>SCP-57 is extremely aggressive when presented with other organisms, either by striking them with its tentacles or pulling them into its body. While active, SCP-57 will continue to consume any foreign objects pulled into it, regardless of what kind of organism it was originally collecting (sea squids are the most common form).</p><p>While inactive, SCP-57 resides in the center of its containment tank and accumulates sustenance by consuming food particles and sea water. A remote camera has been installed into the tank to monitor as much behavior and activity as possible.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
