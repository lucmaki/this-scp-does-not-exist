<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-835</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-835 is to be kept in a standard Safe object locker at Site-77. Testing of SCP-835 requires the approval of at least two (2) Level 3 personnel assigned as test subjects, and is to be performed at least once per week.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-835 is a set of three (3) pairs of headphones, each pair manufactured by and branded with one of the following companies: Bang & Olufsen International Inc. [B&OI], Sennheiser Electronic Corporation [SBC], and Sony Corporation of America [(SCEA).] SCP-835 is a standard 3.5mm jack plug, and contains no additional components.</p><p>When SCP-835 is plugged into any audio device, it will output the desired frequency at a rate proportional to the level of audio present in the device. The headphones themselves operate normally, and only change when they are used with an audio device that doesn't support the intended frequency; unmodified B&OI headphones can be used to play music on conventional stereo systems, but will not produce anything but noise when used with those systems.</p><p>SCP-835's anomalous effect occurs when multiple instances are plugged into the same audio product, such as a portable stereo system or a home theater system. Each instance of SCP-835 will transmit simultaneously at the intended frequencies, producing harmonics and other interference that can confound most listeners' perceptions both audibly and visually. Extended exposure may induce acute hearing loss, euphoria, or even hallucinations similar to those caused by narcotics or hallucinogens; prolonged exposure has been known to cause nausea, vomiting, migraines, vertigo, and even heart attacks in some individuals. These effects can be reduced if each instance of SCP-35 is adjusted separately so that every listener only receives one broadcast at a time.</p><p>Both B&OI headphones and SBC headphones have been shown capable of transmitting multiple distinct sounds simultaneously through this process; however, while SCEA headphones do not possess this capacity alone, they are capable of distinguishing between different frequencies transmitted simultaneously from other pairs of SCP-835 instances.</p><p>As of 09/19/2349, no known way has ever been devised to reproduce the range of frequencies available through SCP-835 instances except for through use by instances connected to an audio device. Each instance is also equipped with a small LED display monitor indicating the frequency currently broadcasting from it; note that these displays have proven difficult to read without prior training in measuring frequencies.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
