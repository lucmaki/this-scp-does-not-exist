<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-90</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-90 is kept in an enclosure at Site-77. SCP-90’s enclosure is to be maintained with a reasonable level of room temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and food availability. The enclosure’s floor is to be lined with sand, gravel, or concrete.</p><p>SCP-90 is not to be directly supervised by personnel who do not already have direct experience with electronics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-90 is an Astradroid, a humanoid bipedal robot designed and manufactured in the late 1980s by Insitu Incorporated. SCP-90's chassis is of a solid steel frame that is 5 mm thick. The two rear wheels are connected to servos, while the center drive motor is connected through a central shaft.</p><p>SCP-90 has two arms that terminate in three fingers on each hand. Each end of the arm has six joints at .275 inch intervals. These joints allow for movement in 12 degrees of freedom, which roughly approximates human motion. This motion is transmitted to a wrist joint on the arm’s upper arm. Each shoulder on the arm can rotate independently of its counterparts. The shoulder joints are actuated by servos within the suit’s arms, which also have a range of motion beyond those allowed by human anatomy.</p><p>Each finger on both arms possess four degrees of freedom: finger rotation, elevation, bending and finger extension. Finger rotation is achieved through a joint in each finger; elevation is achieved from a plunger system in the palm of each hand; bending may be achieved through manipulation of flexible thin wires that extend from each fingertip; and finger extension—detectable only with advanced equipment—is achieved by bending the elongated fingertips backward towards the palm to complete an inverted “V”-shape between the palm and little fingers. SCP-90 does not have opposable thumbs due to its design and cannot grasp objects without assistance.</p><p>In addition to its arms, SCP-90 can demonstrate limited locomotion using the “pneumatic shock absorber system” included with its chassis. This system consists of 14 inflatable bladders located throughout the suit's legs, hips, chest and abdomen that allows SCP-90 to bend over when walking or standing up after sitting down. When inflated, these bladders will keep SCP-90's torso upright regardless of body weight distribution, greatly reducing strain on its joints. These bladders deflate after 3 hours of deflation or exceeding 25%, although even when deflated they provide enough resistance to allow SCP-90 to walk at speeds generally below 20km/h (12mph) when tested under extreme conditions such as during evacuations. The shock absorber system also allows SCP-90 to travel extremely long distances without overloading its joints with excessive force.</p><p>Ascertaining exact details about how this system functions has proven difficult due to SCP-90's robotic nature and software lockout preventing access from most modern computing equipment; it is theorized that SCP-90 uses pneumatic pressure combined with counterpressure supplied by compressed gas bladders held by both hands to brace itself against abnormal forces applied at any point along its skeleton.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
