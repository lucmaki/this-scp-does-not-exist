<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-439</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All members of SCP-439 are to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The chamber is to be equipped with an attached bed, toilet, and shower facility.</p><p>Cell maintenance staff are to visit the cells once every week to clean, vacuum, and mop the floor. Weekly checkups of SCP-439 are to be carried out by medical staff. Two guards patrol the containment chamber at all times. If an instance of SCP-439 has not been observed for a month, a guard is to be assigned to stay with that instance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-439 is a group of individuals whose physiology is indistinguishable from that of ordinary humans. The subjects' biochemistry and genetics, however, are in all ways similar to those of a person who has been genetically engineered to be identical to a human being. They each have a particular organ structure that is either absent or modified so as to look and function like the corresponding organ.</p><p>These organs are not just cosmetic changes. They seem to act just like they do in humans and produce genuine human hormones, enzymes and other substances. These substances interact with the corresponding tissues in a way that leads to an extremely high rate of normal human function for organs that do not normally perform such functions. This includes skeleton, musculature, nervous system, blood vessels, digestive system tissue [DATA EXPUNGED]</p><p>While testing SCP-439's mental capabilities was inconclusive (their IQs range from 93 to 187), their physical abilities as measured by balance, strength, and reaction time have been shown to be sufficient for them to function normally in society.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
