<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-950</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-950 is to be kept in a climate-controlled chamber at its site of discovery, with no more than three (3) standard test subjects in at a time. The temperature of the chamber is to be maintained at 12 degrees Celsius.</p><p>When not under investigation, subjects that have interacted with SCP-950 are to be kept on a diet of water and non-perishable foods. Any type of SCP-950 exposure is to be dealt with as rapidly as possible by dousing the subject with water after its effects expire. It is understood that exposure to SCP-950 will continue during a controlled return to normal conditions.</p><p>SCP-950 has been sealed into a chamber equipped for destructive testing at Site-21. Any modifications made to this chamber are to be approved by a Level 2 staff member.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-950 is a humanoid figure of indeterminate gender, 16.5 meters in height, covered in a thick layer of frost and ice. SCP-950 possesses a beard and the ability to project clouds of frozen droplets from its eyes, which it can use as weapons.</p><p>Subjects that have interacted with SCP-950 (hereafter referred to as "test subjects") report that they experience extreme cold and numbness throughout their body as well as blurred vision. In some cases, test subjects report having difficulty breathing.</p><p>The effects of SCP-950 appear to be acute physical discomfort if the subject remains within an environment where it is present for more than five minutes at a time. Extended exposure causes the subject's veins to freeze over and leave them unable to move. Slightly less severe effects occur if the subject is exposed repeatedly over a longer period of time.</p><p>SCP-950 appears not to be affected by its own effect beyond minor disorientation or moments of confusion. Testing has shown that objects and organisms are unaffected by SCP-950's effect.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
