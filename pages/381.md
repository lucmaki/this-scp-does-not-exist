<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-381</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-381 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-77. The chamber is to be kept at ambient temperature and humidity, and must be equipped with air conditioning. SCP-381 may be moved into a holding cell during testing, but must remain within the containment room at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-381 is a large, solid wooden house, with a flat roof and two windows. SCP-381 does not appear to show any cracks or other signs of damage. SCP-381 was dubbed “The Crowded House” by those in the area shortly after the discovery of its anomalous properties, although it has no identifying feature that would lead to this nickname.</p><p>SCP-381 has two anomalous properties which manifest when it is in a populated area. If a human being enters the crowd of SCP-381 while they are there, they will be unable to leave until they leave the crowd. As long as there is at least one human being in the crowd, however, a ceiling will form over SCP-381 whenever it reaches a certain size. This ceiling will remain for approximately thirty seconds before falling back down. When this happens, any humans within it will not be harmed by this fall, as long as they have not left the crowd.</p><p>If a human being exits the crowd and stands outside of it, however, none of them will be able to leave SCP-381 until the last human being leaves it. At no point during this time will any human being be able to leave SCP-381 safely and immediately escape its anomalous properties, even if they are severely injured or cannot move due to their injuries. The only way to escape this crowding effect is to die.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
