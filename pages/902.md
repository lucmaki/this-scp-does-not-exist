<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-902</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As it is currently believed that there are no other "sculptures" of this kind, Foundation agents embedded within the Parisian art world have been assigned to monitor any similar stories and remove them from circulation.</p><p>Over the years, many reports of theft have been reported in connection with SCP-902. All such reports will be investigated thoroughly and the object recovered by use of covert gunmen by Mobile Task Force Omega-4 ("The Men in Black"). Sufficient evidence of vandalism or theft will be compared to more recent footage from cameras set out to monitor SCP-902's history. The result will allow recovered SCP-902 objects to be identified as originating from the private collection of a Foundation cover identity.</p><p>Though most art historians believe SCP-902 was not purchased but rather acquired through donation or an unaccounted gift, its true origin remains unknown and undetermined.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-902 is a modern sculpture coming from the early 20th century (c. 1910-1929) that depicts an unidentified character sitting at a desk, writing or drawing. SCP-902 has no discernable origins or previous owners.</p><p>Since its discovery and installation in a public art gallery in Paris, SCP-902 has been reported to be stolen and later returned in exchange for small amounts of cash or other valuables. In addition, numerous attempts to damage SCP-902 have been reported; the first such effort resulted in [REDACTED].</p><p>Note: All information regarding SCP-902's history prior to its discovery outside of Foundation control is classified under Level Omega.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
