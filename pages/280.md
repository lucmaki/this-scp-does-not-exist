<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-280</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Containment is complicated by the fact that the Foundation does not possess any reliable means of identifying the origins of SCP-280 instances. The only clues we have are:</p><p>Identification: All SCP-280 instances appear to be human. The average height, weight and skeletal structure appear consistent with a normal human. On the other hand, there is typically an unusually high level of adiposity and osteoarthritis in the joints due to the high amount of time spent in sedentary activities. This may change as they age, but it has been seen to occur in 30% or more of recent SCP-280 samples.</p><p>SCP-280 are genetically autonomous and will engage in autonomous behavioural patterns outside of Foundation control. Once acquired, they become trapped within the Foundation for a period of 99 years with no way to return to their normal environment. They consist primarily of office workers, academics and (most often) authors; although some police officers, business people and other professionals have been discovered. Exactly why this subpopulation exists is currently unknown.</p><p>Attempts to induce SCP-280 out of containment always terminate in failure; it is believed that the use of feeding tubes renders any attempt at escape futile on an individual basis. For this reason, SCP-280 are terminated when possible under the guise of natural causes. In addition, all SCP-280 instances encountered must be terminated at once, due to their tendency to engage in violent actions once broken out of containment.</p><p>Researchers assigned to SCP-280 are issued encrypted keys based on their position or professional background. A sample key is given below:</p><p>Key Description:</p><p>Experiment Log 280:</p><p>The following experiment was performed on a single instance of SCP-280-A using the key provided above.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-280-A sat on the floor of the testing chamber. When it was requested to stand, it could not so long as it remained in this position for several hours. When asked what it would like to do, SCP-280-A responded that it wanted to sit down and watch television. In response to the request to be turned back into a human, SCP-280-A picked up a smartphone and began using its GPS function using its thumb.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
