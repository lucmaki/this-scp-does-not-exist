<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-494</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-494 has no current containment procedures due to being an urban legend. Any reports of SCP-494 are to be ignored by the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-494 is a house located in [REDACTED]. SCP-494 has a history of being accessed by several entities who remain undetected.</p><p>SCP-494 is home to a family consisting of three adults, two children, and two dogs. The occupants of the house will always open their doors and windows to allow the entry of any individual to their home.</p><p>Attempts to apprehend or destroy SCP-474 have proven futile without prior research on the entity. Upon reaching adulthood, individuals that are granted entry into SCP-474's home will be granted the abilities of a demigod upon death. The residence has shown to contain several items that correlate with the mythologies of many nations around the world.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
