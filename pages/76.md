<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-76</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-76 is to be kept in a Standard Safe at Site-77 under the guise of an Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. Upon becoming active, SCP-76's exterior should be coated completely with an anti-freeze/water solution.</p><p>In the event that SCP-76 begins to disappear or change form without provocation, security personnel may enter the room designated by SCP-76 and retrieve it if it is not visible. In the event the containment area is inaccessible via the portal, security personnel are to use a designated "scrying" portal in Site-77 and retrieve SCP-76 from its location. Any personnel who come into contact with SCP-76 during this transition are to immediately report to their superiors.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-76 is a battery-operated handheld portal device. SCP-76's appearance varies with the subject using it; however, it always takes on the appearance of Captain My Captain (a cartoon altered slightly to avoid copyright infringement).</p><p>SCP-76 functions similarly to other handheld portals, but can do little else. It is only able to transport objects and entities from the "real" world into SCP-76's interior. SCP-76 does not appear to be able to move or teleport freely within its container; instead, SCP-76 requires external power in order to operate.</p><p>SCP-76 is connected to a power source inside Site-77 via a charging cord disconnected from any mains, and as long as this cord is connected, it will continue to function normally. In addition, if SCP-76 is removed from this power source for more than 30 minutes (approximately 30 seconds when powered), it will immediately lose all function and disintegrate completely until the next time it is moved away from its power source. SCP-76 will often emit an audible warning when approaching this state. When removed from its power source, the signal necessary for SCP-76 to connect back cannot be detected by any means available by Foundation physics research.</p><p>When placed on the ground and connected to its power source, SCP-76 exhibits anomalous behavior including:</p><p>SCP-76 also has limited photographic capabilities, allowing security personnel to view an image of whoever was last in contact with it in its previous containment area. The person depicted in photographs taken with SCP-76 are listed below:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
