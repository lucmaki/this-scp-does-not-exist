<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-578</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-578 is to be stored in a petri dish-shaped object housing chamber at Site-28, which may be accessed via the facility's supply elevator. The chamber should be heated to a temperature of 23 degrees Celsius or less, and oxygen should be provided by reverse osmosis filters on the outer surface of the chamber. The object housing chamber should always be within view of at least one security camera. Any SCP-578 within the containment unit must be kept away from direct sunlight, but this precaution is not required for SCP-578-1 instances.</p><p>SCP-578 is capable of being moved under appropriate conditions, but it does not move independently from its current location unless </p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-578 appears to be a thin layer of crust on top of a creamy filling. When SCP-578 is not moved from its original position, it will form a human face over the food. However, despite the face's resemblance to actual humans (as well as other animals), it is imperceptible to the human eye. The number of instances of SCP-578 will continue to increase over time. Although SCP-578 has no perceived volume, it appears to remain completely intact until it is detached.</p><p>SCP-578 cannot be eaten or eaten by others (including itself) without consequence. The faces that form appear vaguely humanoid, with two large eyes and two noses resembling those of human faces. When a person eats or ingests a piece of SCP-578, the head or face will drift away and hover above the subject, observing them. If the subject is observed for long enough, an instance of SCP-579 will envelop them, which appears to contain an instance of SCP-578 which is attached to its lower half. This occurs whenever any part of the subject's body touches anything regardless of whether it has physical contact with an object that also contains SCP-579; thus, this can occur even if subjects do not eat or ingest any part of SCP-578 (such as if their fingernails touch the surface).</p><p>SCP-579 instances are described in detail below:</p><p>SCP-579 and SCP-578</p><p>The actions taken by SCP-579 instances and individuals infected by them appear to be naturally occurring responses to stimuli, rather than being controlled by intelligent or intentional entities: however, they share many common characteristics. Below are examples of what would happen if one was able to observe such a scenario in action:</p><p>These observations suggest that SCP-579 and SCP-578 were created by something related to humans that senses and expresses itself through their forms (however this "something" may have originated). As such, they are likely sapient organisms themselves.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
