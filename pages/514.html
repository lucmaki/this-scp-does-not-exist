<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-514</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-514 is to be kept within a secure locker. No personnel are permitted to view this object without the express written consent of at least one (1) level 3 or higher personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-514 is a drawing in pen and ink of an early 20th century period British war poster, titled “OUR BRITAIN REDIVIVUS” (pictured). The original poster has not been recovered and has been assumed lost.</p><p>On the back of SCP-514 (facing the viewer) is the following inscription:</p><p>I have my sights set on you, nay!</p><p>Those who think they have learned to hide in the shadows shall soon be revealed!</p><p>The shadows of skulking ruffians make a good hiding place for traitors, but that's all they are.</p><p>So I will see you out into the open, where you may hang by your neck or be lashed to a gallows post – whichever method you prefer!</p><p>I may be merciful in this case – I'm inclined to be lenient with those who wish to turn their back on those who saved them from certain death!</p><p>Inscription was suggested by Dr. ████████ (see below).</p><p>Decompression experiments based on SCP-514 showed that a standard 1.5 meter x 1.5 meter room would expand under SCP-514's influence until it reaches its original size after ██ hours at which point SCP-514 would revert to its original state.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
