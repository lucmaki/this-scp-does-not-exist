<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-786</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-786 is to be kept in a sealed metal box. In the rare event that it is opened with an unauthorized key, it is to be immediately sealed and secured by security personnel. Attempts at counter-surveillance by SCP-786's owner are to be targeted and suppressed, with no exceptions.</p><p>The Foundation has recently come into contact with ██████ Corporation's Advanced Research division, who have expressed an interest in funding studies of the anomalies on the object. They have been made aware of its anomalous properties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-786 is an unmarked steel briefcase with a simple lock. If anyone other than the owner attempts to open it using a key, it will vibrate until the lock opens. It will then reveal itself to be a telephone, which can make and receive calls. The number of times this has happened is currently unknown.</p><p>The phone lines used by SCP-786 have been charged by security personnel on a pay-per-use basis. It is currently unknown how much information has been received from SCP-786's phone conversations; research into this anomaly was not initially classified as top priority due to the fact that they occurred while the object was in Foundation hands.</p><p>Further investigation indicates that SCP-786 may only work with certain phones; it has been made sure that any one who accesses its abilities must have at least one line registered to them, and no further information on SCP-786's anomalous properties can be obtained from it beyond what has already been documented.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
