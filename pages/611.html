<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-611</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-611 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject's diet is to be restricted to non-prescription fruit only, with a daily intake of one banana, one apple, and one orange. SCP-611 is to be examined at least weekly by on-site physicians, who shall note any changes or irregularities in organs or physical condition.</p><p>Standard humanoid exercise is allowed, but no contact should be made with SCP-611 while it is being physically examined.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-611 is a humanoid of roughly 9 ft, 6 in tall. Its skin is an indeterminate, pale white color, with occasional patches of red hair. SCP-611's skin displays no abnormalities that would impede its use as clothing or body paint. One anomalous feature of SCP-611's skin is the fact that it absorbs certain radio and microwave energy quite well, subjecting the skin to extreme heat but little harm.</p><p>SCP-611 has been designated as Safe due to the fact that no harm has ever been caused to either SCP-611 or any objects contained within its reach. SCP-611 has demonstrated a behavioral pattern of ceaselessly seeking out and consuming large amounts of food (typically consisting of dairy products, meat and fresh produce), often leaving the site it has resided in for several days at a time before returning with new provisions.</p><p>Studies have revealed the following information about SCP-611:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
