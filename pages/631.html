<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-631</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The object is to be kept in a specially constructed containment room, approximately 10 meters behind the south end of the ████████████ building. The room is to be monitored by closed-circuit television and motion detectors, with the alarm being triggered if the object moves more than 5 meters from its original position.</p><p>Site-24 personnel are to be given one key for access to SCP-631's containment area. As of Incident 631-3, all personnel are forbidden from entering SCP-631's containment area without permission from at least two Level 3 staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-631 appears to be a standard elevator of the ████████████ brand, but it has been discovered in several locations around the world. The exact source of SCP-631 is unknown, though it is theorized that it was constructed at some point during the 19th century.</p><p>SCP-631's anomalous properties manifest when an individual presses its "down" button. If the person finishes pressing the button before the elevator doors open, SCP-631 will move to a location approximately 10 meters away from its original position. It is unknown how SCP-631 does this, and it has so far only been observed to do so once per day, between the hours of noon and 1pm local time.</p><p>The effects of SCP-631's movements were first noticed on ██/██/19██, when a Foundation researcher was called to investigate an anomaly in his apartment building. When he pressed the button on his floor, SCP-631 moved to the first floor, then back down again. Since then, SCP-631 has been documented performing this action at least twice daily.</p><p>Since Incident 631-1 and Incident 631-2, all staff working with SCP-631 have become increasingly concerned that it may be attempting to escape its current containment area. Given that there are no known ways to stop SCP-631 from moving, any attempts to restrain it would most likely lead to its destruction.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
