<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-228</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-228 is stored in a standard containment locker at Site-66. There is to be no attempt to examine SCP-228 while it is inactive and no personnel are to attempt conversation with the creature without being accompanied by a Level 3 or higher security member.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-228 is an audio cassette tape measuring 10.5 cm by 5.4 cm and labeled "B.R.B." The object plays only one track, which is the song "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine" from the original 1966 album "Abbey Road", by The Beatles. SCP-228 was found in a box at the singer Paul McCartney's residence on 29 September 1974. No more cassettes were found and it is presumed SCP-228 was ████th of a full album, as it took only two weeks to record (and three months to produce).</p><p>The image of SCP-228 shows that there are two additional cassettes inside; the third track, part of the song "Here Comes The Sun", is not present. There is also an image of a triceratops on the front cover, wearing sunglasses and holding a baseball bat with its right forefoot. No information is given except for maybe being a dinosaur and potentially loving music.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
