<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-378</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-378 is stored in a standard containment locker located at Site-19. Any personnel with Level 1 clearance or higher are allowed to view SCP-378 as part of their training. No personnel who have contact with SCP-378 outside of supervision are to be expelled from the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-378 is a full-size model of the ship of Homeric legend, the Hero, Ulysses. Originally all wood, SCP-378 has been reinforced with steel over time and is currently constructed from reinforced plastic and filled with sand. Despite this, SCP-378 will not fracture or fracture under normal testing conditions.</p><p>Any person that touches SCP-378 becomes affected by its anomalous properties. Anyone affected will begin to exhibit signs of a mental illness affecting their ability to speak. This mental disorder manifests in a variety of ways, the most common being:</p><p>SCP-378 was originally discovered on ██/██/1986 when an anonymous tip led Foundation agents to investigate a house located in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Inside they found the body of Thomas █████████████ (nicknamed "Tom" by his family). Tom had been missing for a week before his disappearance was noticed and he was declared deceased at that point. His home had been ransacked and heavily damaged; police believed it to be a burglary gone wrong.</p><p>During their investigation, agents found the body of Tom's father, Charles █████████████ (nicknamed "Chuck" by his family) lying in his bed. He had died from [DATA EXPUNGED] before his home had been broken into and his son killed. Both bodies were severely decomposed and covered in severe burns; it is theorized that both victims were burned alive. The bodies were taken for autopsy but during this process, Agent ████████ came across a red envelope in Chuck's desk drawer containing SCP-378.</p><p>The envelope itself appeared intact other than some minor stains; however the message inside was unreadable due to it being partially burned upon inspection. All attempts to recreate the message have failed, as no one who has seen it can recall anything other than appearing blurry and "unfocused".</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
