<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-135</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-135 is to be kept in a standard Safe item locker at Site ██, currently in the testing wing. Testing of SCP-135 is currently prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-135 is a stairway climber with the ability to climb up any surface, albeit slowly. When activated, the rate of speed at which SCP-135 climbs will increase exponentially, up to a maximum rate of 15 mps. It has been found that SCP-135's climbing rate can be affected by varying factors, and can change rapidly based on time and location.</p><p>The majority of times SCP-135 is used for rescue purposes, it does not seem to affect the climbing speed of SCP-135. Only two instances have been documented that resulted in a lower climbing rate than the one programmed into the object.</p><p>Instances where SCP-135 has been utilized for rescue purposes range from ██ civilians to ██████████ agents.</p><p>To date, only four civilians have died while utilizing SCP-135: three in [DATA EXPUNGED], and one in [REDACTED]. Of the six known agents who perished while utilizing SCP-135 (five while attempting entry into a breach site, and one during an Overwatch site clearance), all were killed by being caught in high fall hazards (including [DATA EXPUNGED]).</p><p>Notably, none of those who died had anomalous traits or abilities that would cause them to have a higher death toll than the regular members of their team.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
