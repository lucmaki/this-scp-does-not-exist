<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-515</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-515 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, to which only Class 2/515 personnel have access. The SCP-515 is to be stored following the guidelines established by Department of Redundancy Department and may not be removed from its containment locker without permission. SCP-515 may only be handled with a thin pair of tweezers or forceps.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-515 is a pair of thumbtack dispensers, manufactured by Standard Industries. The dispensers are marked with the words "In case of emergency, break this glass. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN." The dispensers are connected via a twelve gauge copper wire.</p><p>In the event that any human comes into contact with SCP-515, they will be immediately affected by the dispenser. Upon removing the thumbtack from their finger, the affected individual will have all other joints jammed by the thumbtack. Approximately sixteen hours after being affected, the affected individual will develop greyish hard skin, similar to crabs or octopuses. This skin is lighter than normal human flesh, and has an unusually high tolerance to physical trauma.</p><p>Subjects that survive to thirty days post-initialization of this effect include test subjects who are subjected to extremely difficult or dangerous tasks such as excavating mountains or swimming in shark infested waters. Subjects that survive longer than ninety days retain this anomalous property (around 3% chance per month). In addition, these subjects find it extremely difficult to perform manual labor, even when they do not possess any anomalously enhanced strength or dexterity.</p><p>SCP-515 was recovered on 12/12/1875 when Foundation personnel discovered an abandoned warehouse in ████ ████████, ██ known for its industrial cast products drug testing pens and gauges. A fire burned out of control for several weeks in the factory before workers noticed that no one was coming in or out of the building. After interviewing residents who lived nearby and reacquiring SCP-515 from a shop owner, it was discovered that SCP-515 had been passing along all of its victims to an unknown source for unknown reasons.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
