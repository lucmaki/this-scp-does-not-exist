<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-672</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to maintain a permanent presence in ██████. The town is to be guarded by security forces, and the surrounding area patrolled with an aircraft. Any civilians affected by SCP-672 are to be detained and administered amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-672 is an anomaly that initially manifested on April ██, 1973, one year after the Vietnam War ended. SCP-672 affects civilians who have served in the Vietnam War, with their effects extending to their descendants.</p><p>After the first manifestation of SCP-672, instances affected by SCP-672 will exhibit behavior that is attributed to psychological and physical trauma sustained in the war. Affected subjects will regularly draw the attention of Foundation personnel, as well as civilians who are aware of the phenomenon. When interacting with civilians, affected subjects will progress into highly depressed and withdrawn states, often refusing food or attending mandatory therapy sessions.</p><p>Tests show that SCP-672's effect is permanent, regardless of treatment and intervention provided; there are no known cases of those effected exhibiting symptoms of PTSD or depression lasting less than five years after its initial manifestation.</p><p>SCP-672 was first discovered when an instance of ████████ ██████ (a Vietnamese civilian) was detained at a Los Angeles hotel for drawing attention to his depression by killing himself in what was later revealed to be a failed suicide attempt. The subject’s body was recovered and brought into containment following the event; it was noted that his pulse had significantly lowered to 7 times normal rate. The subject’s brain tissue was found to be anomalous; upon analysis, it was determined that he had been affected by SCP-672 following the 1975 American withdrawal from Vietnam.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
