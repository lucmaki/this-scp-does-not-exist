<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-619</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Omega Protocol</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-619 is currently housed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-17. A guard must observe the test chamber at all times, and may leave his post only for testing purposes. Guard staff are to be of average physical condition, and must be able to operate at least one firearm. Guards are to remain in the chamber until SCP-619 has been escorted out by security; testing may continue after SCP-619 has been removed from SCP-619 chamber, but must stop upon SCP-619's return to the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-619 is a Caucasian male, approximately 24 years of age. SCP-619 has claimed to be 45 years old, from a rural town in the American Midwest. In addition, SCP-619 has been recorded as saying "I am too old for you." However, due to SCP-619's age and fastidious appearance, Foundation agents have no way of verifying this claim.</p><p>When questioned about their background, SCP-619 will use their hands and legs to describe a person or object. This description is always accurate when viewed by an outside observer. Once asked to describe where they live, they will describe the exact house they are currently occupying. When asked how they entered their current residence, they will draw a picture of the doors and windows being unlocked at night. When asked to draw the inside of their dwelling, they will draw a house identical to the one they are currently staying in. When asked why they chose their current residence, SCP-619 will describe family members and long lost friends living there. When tested on this point further, SCP-619 will claim that they have not seen or spoken with them since they were five or six years old. Addendum: It has been hypothesized that SCP-619's memories may originate from another reality. If true it would explain how SCP-619 appears to always know what an observer is thinking about, without them stating anything with them. A man claiming to be 26 years of age currently resides at the same address as SCP-619.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
