<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-185</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A research site has been established for the study of SCP-185. All bee colonies from any geographic location confirmed to contain SCP-185 are to be removed from their habitats, taken prisoner and relocated to the containment area. No further information regarding the phenomenon is currently available.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-185 is an anomalous property of certain colonies of bees, Dacchini, which have been observed to "contain" objects and animate them. If a colony containing the anomaly is removed from its native habitat, no new instances are created in the same location.</p><p>The object will take on the form of whatever may be in the colony at the time of removal. Known examples include:</p><p>The properties of objects animated by SCP-185 vary greatly, with many behaving violently or destructively. Instances appear to be fully aware of their own properties, and some carnivorous instances have even been observed to consume their own containers.</p><p>Once removed from its native habitat, most SCP-185 instances lose all sentience and fail to respond to normal stimuli. A few instances survive, however, and become aggressive toward any person or animal they encounter after acclimation. SCP-185 has not been able to adapt to captivity yet; consequently, all SCP-185 instances are kept in large bee boxes at Site-45 for further research.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
