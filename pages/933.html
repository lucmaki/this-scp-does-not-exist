<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-933</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-933 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, the key for which is currently held by Dr. ██████. A video camera trained on the object at all times is to be positioned in the research area, and personnel are to avoid approaching it for testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-933 appears to be a short length of string attached to a dog, approximately 3m long. Neither end of the object is visible. It appears to respond to verbal commands (including two instances in which the object uttered one word for 10 consecutive minutes).</p><p>When SCP-933 moves, it does so with great precision, traveling along the ground at speeds up to 15km/h before stopping. Its movement has been observed to closely resemble the movements of a dog when on command. When not moving, it hangs limply in place.</p><p>SCP-933 was recovered from an abandoned farmhouse in ████████, England after reports of a "psychic dog" had been passed along local police departments by one [REDACTED], who had received them from [REDACTED].</p><p>MTF Beta-7 ("Psychonauts") has been assigned to investigate and test SCP-933. Exposure to any object related to domestic pets (especially dogs) has demonstrated that SCP-933 will respond accordingly. This response differs for each individual.</p><p>Interview 933-2: Written by Dr. ████████</p><p>Dated: ██/██/20██</p><p>[Dr. ████████ is sitting at a table with a notebook and pen.]</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr. ███████n: Hello?

<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
