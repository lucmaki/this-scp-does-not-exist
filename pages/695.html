<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-695</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-695 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-06. The area surrounding the cell is to be floodlit at all times. Reports of SCP-695's inexplicable disappearance should be dismissed as instances of SCP-012.</p><p>A medical kit is to be kept in the cell and replaced after use by Foundation personnel. All personnel are not to enter the cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-695 appears to be a male with a body mass at or below human standards. SCP-695 is ambulatory, despite its size and strength. It appears to have no biological need for food or sleep, as it recovers from such sensations immediately.</p><p>SCP-695 moves in an erratic manner that has been observed to elicit laughter in witnesses. Beings within hearing range of SCP-695 are compelled to move towards it; moving away causes them to fall or otherwise become immobile. This effect is primarily verified by SCP-012 effects, and does not appear to be perceived by SCP-695 itself.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
