<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-923</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The story of SCP-923 is to be kept secret from the public at large. Foundation operatives posing as astronomers have been authorised to observe and report on occurrences consistent with the anomaly's parameters.</p><p>In the event of a sighting, pursuit and retrieval are to be effected by Mobile Task Force Phi-4 "Galaxy Patrol" and Project Airbourne, in conjunction with a SSP-equipped firefighting unit.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-923 is a rapidly expanding sphere of space that occupies a portion of the observable universe, and is currently theorised to be accelerating. It may be visible to terrestrial telescopes, but presentation of the description as an extraterrestrial object would reduce the likelihood of it being studied by intelligent beings.</p><p>Interviews with astronomers who have observed SCP-923 suggest that its size has increased at an exponential rate since sighting in 1852; however, non-anomalous objects such as supernovae and galaxies typically expand over billions of years.</p><p>SCP-923's expansion is not linear; when first noticed in 1852, observations suggested a radius of only about 25 m (m=megatons). A year later, this had expanded to nearly 10 km, and it continued to expand exponentially through the next century without stopping. By 2005, SCP-49 was thought to be "only" 1–2 km in diameter, but recent estimates place the sphere's radius at 653 billion lightyears. In 20██, researchers estimated its size at 12.8 billion lightyears in radius and approximately 3 quadrillion kilometers in length.</p><p>The initial cause for these observed growth rates is unknown. There are some hypotheses, but none has yet been tested by experimentation.</p><p>Due to the brightening effects of gravity on smaller objects, it seems likely that SCP-923 will continue accelerating until it reaches approximately 50–200 times the mass of our sun; however, no specific upper limit has been set on the anomalous properties involved in this process.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
