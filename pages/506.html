<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-506</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-506 is to be kept in a standard containment locker in Site-28's Safe Object wing, with a closed circuit television camera installed and connected to audio surveillance system. A night light has been installed to conceal SCP-506 from casual observation. A door has been incorporated into the containment locker which requires 20 points of pressure to open.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-506 appears to be an empty plastic bottle of hair product, identical in all aspects. However, when a human subject attempts to open the bottle, they will instead produce a blow job from the material on opening the bottle. The subject will then receive sexual stimulation from the oral sex being performed on them by the entity inhabiting SCP-506.</p><p>SCP-506 is capable of turning verbally abusive when it becomes bored with being used as a toy. If allowed access to a human subject, it will perceive its human subjects as rewards for maintaining its entertainment level at satisfactory levels.</p><p>SCP-506's ability is not removed through physical removal of the object, although SCP-506's ability changes over time and can only be maintained if sufficiently aroused. In addition, SCP-506 is currently unable to produce orgasms due to recent damage inflicted in testing incident #1D-23. SCP-506 has suggested that it may attempt to construct a replacement penis once repairs have been completed.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
