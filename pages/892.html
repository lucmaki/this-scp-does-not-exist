<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-892</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Currently, containment of SCP-892 is ongoing, with the Foundation maintaining a low profile in local news articles. The Foundation has thus far declined to comment on the matter.</p><p>SCP-892 is to be kept in a secure storage locker. Any instances of SCP-892 in public should be brought aboard Foundation vessels, and kept under heavy guard.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-892 is a collection of 54 newspapers, all dated between 9/12/2009 and 8/31/2011. While the dates make them relevant to the United States, the pages themselves are dated to be from 12/4/2010, which makes them correspond with Long Island. Each issue's date can be determined from the year on the bottom corner of the front page, which is always December 4th of that year.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
