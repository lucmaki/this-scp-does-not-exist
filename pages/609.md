<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-609</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-609 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The creature is fed once daily via the standard SCF feeding method. All personnel interacting with SCP-609 are to wear full body biohazard suits, and communicate solely through prearranged voice modulators, due to the aggressive nature of its mental speech patterns.</p><p>Any personnel attempting to communicate with SCP-609 should be escorted by 3 armed guards at all times to avoid hostile or accidental physical contact. SCP-609 itself is to remain sedentary within its containment cell at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-609 is a female hunchbacked humanoid, approximately 1.4 meters tall, weighing about 50 kilograms. SCP-609 possesses a pronounced sloping back and abnormally strong legs which allow it to reach higher (and thus better) levels of physical fitness than humans.</p><p>SCP-609's body chemistry is unique, leading to an unusually high level of an unidentified polymer being produced by its skeletal system and viscera. The polymer absorbs light around the visible spectrum and converts it into heat at a rate approximately three times that of standard human tissue. This heating process has been shown to cause necrosis in regions of the subject's skeleton, including the spina bifida on its spine.</p><p>Discovery: SCP-610 was discovered on ██/██/████ in a firehouse in [REDACTED], Florida after a report had been filed by firefighters for performance issues (reports indicated speech difficulties, as well as occasional violent episodes). Upon examination by Foundation agents posing as doctors, it was determined that there were no medical problems aside from minor structural imperfections in the subject's rib cage, pelvis, and lower leg bones.</p><p>Upon interviewing the subject (who spoke through a special vocal amplifier) it was discovered that the subject had suffered two separate work-related injuries while working at a warehouse in [REDACTED].</p><p>The first incident occurred several months prior to discovery when the subject performed shift duty carrying large boxes containing devices used for liquid observation. While moving one of these devices the subject fell on top of the device and shattered part of its hip bone, leading to sudden admissions to hospital for treatment. At this time the device was returned to its original crate along with all other damaged items from the warehouse.</p><p>The second incident occurred only days later when the subject was attempting to move a heavy water pipe from place to place (the pipe weighed over 140 kilograms). As the pipe collapsed under its weight and knocked the subject down, she sustained severe spinal injuries when her head crashed into one of the metal supports beneath her feet. She remained unconscious for several hours before receiving emergency treatment at local hospitals. Following this injury SCP-610 displayed blatant and violent aggression towards itself, finding ways to damage critical organs and crippling limbs in an attempt to inflict harm upon itself once more. The resulting surgeries prevented any further permanent damage to SCP-610's skeleton; however it was still unable to work due to extensive nerve damage caused by blunt trauma in addition to persistent pain and swelling in her extremities.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
