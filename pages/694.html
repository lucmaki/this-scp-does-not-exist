<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-694</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-694 is stored in a locked safe, accessible only by personnel with level 4 clearance or higher. It is to be removed before any research involving SCP-694 and must be returned after the procedure has been completed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-694 is a lipstick container with a faint black pattern visible on its surface. The design is identical to that of the mini-sized tube of 74R-Lippenstift (“74R” for short), the standard lipstick brand of Germany, except that its casing is black instead of white. This case was originally manufactured by L'Oreal in 1994 for the purpose of displaying their product, and was sold under the name L'Oreal Cosmetics until 2004, when it was voluntarily recalled by the company.</p><p>SCP-694 also contains an identical number of mini-sized tubes of 74R-Lippenstift as its own, which it has been long suspected of possessing through unknown means. However, testing has revealed that no internal details have been altered during SCP creation; only the outer casing has been changed. In addition, nonstandard mini-sized tubes have been created in the past which contain no lipstick at all, but have otherwise been recreated identically to SCP-694 and its miniature counterpart. Furthermore, although no anomalous properties were noted prior to liquidation, testing determined that there is enough product inside SCP-694 to fill over 800 standard sized tubes.</p><p>When an individual applies SCP-694 to their lips, they will perceive themselves as having a natural lip color matching their shade of lipstick (brown with light pink tone) while their lips are still coated with SCP-694's active ingredient. This effect extends to both within and outside of Foundation containment; however, the "natural" perception is dependent on the wearer's level of knowledge regarding make up and makeup products (lowliness or general awareness will induce full lip coverage; highliness or expert knowledge will only induce minor effects). Upon removing SCP-694 from their lips or breaking contact with it (e.g., through kissing or biting), this effect immediately ends. Note that if a subject does not know what a proper shade of lip color looks like, or if they have never used lipstick before, they will have no idea what their appearance should look like; however, anything other than lipstick will be perceived as simply normal on them regardless.</p><p>All individuals who possess levels 2 or above of personal knowledge about cosmetics can recognize SCP-694 when presented with it. When this occurs, they report experiencing feelings and thoughts similar to those associated with wearing 73R Rouge, though they are subtly different: While 73R Rouge causes high quantities of embarrassment in regular individuals who do not regularly use cosmetics, those who know about makeup use no such discomfort and enjoy the experience greatly.</p><p>The only exception to this rule are those who possess low degrees of personal knowledge regarding cosmetics and makeup. These individuals generally experience feelings equivalent to those associated with wearing 73R Rouge but do not report any noticeable enjoyment from using SCP-694. At most they may feel slightly confused at first but not uncomfortable.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
