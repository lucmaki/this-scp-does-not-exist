<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-648</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-648 is to be stored in a standard containment locker (Type C) at Site-██, with periodic inspections for structural integrity. The subject of SCP-648 is to be covered by a glass dome when not in use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-648 is a book of approximately 100 pages bound in leather. The interior contains hand-drawn illustrations depicting the goddess Aphrodite in various poses, elaborate costumes, and multiple variations of draconic imagery. The title page depicts a woman holding a tablet reading "Aphrodisian for the Ages." The text appears to have been written by hand, with variations ranging from anseragraphs to misspellings.</p><p>Sections of other books have been cut out and pasted into the front and back covers, and several pages are torn out entirely. Three pages resembling writing tablets have been glued to one side of the back cover.</p><p>Elements from [REDACTED] (see Site Document 648c) appear throughout SCP-648's drawings. SCP-648's author(s) depict elements from many Greek deities including: Ares, Artemis, Athena, Apollo, Demeter, Hestia, Hephaestus (Hephaestus), Hera, Hermes, Heracles (Hercules), Hyperion (Helios), Iapetus (Jupiter), Io (Io), Kore (Juno), Nemesis (Nemesis), Persephone, Poseidon (Poseidon), Zeus (Zeus), and others. Prints of certain characters also appear on two stitched paper fragments in one drawing of Zeus' chariot: Ares' headdress on the left flank, Athena's helmet in the right lower corner.</p><p>The subject has worn through its binding over time. Researchers investigating SCP-648 claim they hear a faint humming tone rising from within it when open.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
