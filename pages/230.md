<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-230</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-230 is to be contained in a locked safe inside the offices of Dr. Bill ███████, with no exceptions. Personnel entering SCP-230's containment room must pass through biometric scanners. The Foundation's staff is not to be replaced, and all personnel affected by SCP-230 are to be given Class B amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-230 is a small bronze pyramid with an anomalous effect when used in conjunction with its counterpart, SCP-231. While both are identical in size and shape to regular pyramids, centrifugal force severs the apex from the body of SCP-230, while the opposite occurs for SCP-231.</p><p>When two (two) official replicas of one or the other are placed in proximity to each other, they will react by turning sharply away from one another until the anomaly is neutralized. However, if either replica is replaced with another replica, any effect that caused one replica to turn away from the other will be transferred to the new replica. Replica testing has confirmed this. This can be repeated as many times as desired without affecting the reaction initially observed by anyone present. To date, no method of neutralizing this anomaly has been discovered.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
