<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-223</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-223 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell is to contain two beds, one operating table and a shower. SCP-223 may freely roam the site between 0700 and 1900 with permission from Dr. Rimes.</p><p>When not working with SCP-223, researchers are to wear standard Site-19 protective equipment, including respirator masks, chemical goggles, and full-body hazmat suits. In the event of an SCP-223 outbreak, personnel are to be evacuated immediately.</p><p>Active SCP-223 outbreaks are to be suppressed by security personnel stationed at Site-19 who will deploy decontamination agents on affected civilians and civilian vehicles as necessary. Civilians entering Site-19 must also be decontaminated and administered amnestic if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-223 is a male human (SCP-223-1) that was removed from the [REDACTED] ██████ National Wildlife Refuge in █████, Alabama, on 05/05/19██ and scheduled for transport to the nearby [REDACTED] ██████ National Park. SCP-223 refused capture and attacked members of the Mobile Task Force after being transported to Site-19.</p><p>Recovered from SCP-223:</p><p>SCP-223 does not show any signs of aging and cannot be perceived as becoming physically ill, despite being exposed to harmful substances. SCP-223's food intake appears to be enough to support life with no known effects of starvation. Therefore, it is assumed that SCP-223 has no need for sustenance other than necessary biological functions.</p><p>SCP-223 is affected by all diseases that affect humans, including AIDS, cancer and heart disease. However, further investigation into this subject is currently underway. As of this note, SCP-223 shows no additional signs or symptoms outside of these diseases, but due to its vague condition, an accurate assessment cannot be made on its age.</p><p>SCP-223 has shown no pathology or abnormal physical development throughout testing. Despite its relatively unlikely lifespan, SCP-223 shows no signs of extreme fatigue afterward and does not appear to require rest beforehand. In addition, SCP-223 (which had previously been nonverbal) speaks fluently in English as well as Russian and German with little difficulty following instruction from researchers.</p><p>SCP-223 has shown limited resistance to pain and discomfort from injuries sustained while under Foundation custody; however, despite this resistance, SCP-223 must still be supervised during testing or experiments that may result in a wound or scarring.* As such, all limbs below the shoulder are bandaged during testing sessions.* While under sedation at the site hospital wing, SCP-223 will occasionally growl or cry out under extreme pain; however, this is not an indication of pain or discomfort on behalf of the subject.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
