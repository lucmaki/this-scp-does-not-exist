<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-132</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-132 is to be housed in a standard containment cell measuring 2 meters by 3.5 meters. At 3:58pm each day, a cover sheet with the following text is to be placed over the case's security camera lens and a stack of paper is to be placed beneath the lid:</p><p>Containment procedures are lax, as you all know there's nothing we can do about it. The Foundation has been unable to track down the sender or anything in the note other than the end of this Postscript.</p><p>Procedure A-105 "Chipping Away" is to be observed and carried out once every week.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-132 is a CD-Rom disc. It contains several pages of code, which can be easily deciphered by the human brain. Any attempt to do so causes severe pain in the part of the brain that is responsible for seeing and interpreting visual information.</p><p>SCP-132 was found in the possession of one Richard O'Barry, a corporate executive and "animal rights activist" living in ██████, England. O'Barry had described his work in Greenpeace as he was working on it from home.</p><p>On March 16th 1998, after having spent an hour deciphering blocks of text on SCP-132, O'Barry passed out and woke up later at [REDACTED], seriously injured by the loss of multiple fingers and eyesight in that eye. Having lost all sight in one eye, O'Barry had been using his other eye to read SCP-132's cryptic code. The damage had not occurred before this point in time. SCP-132 had been sent by postal mail from ████, Pennsylvania on February 22nd, 1998.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
