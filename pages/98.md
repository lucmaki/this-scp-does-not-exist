<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-98</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-98 is to be kept in a locked safe in the containment wing of Site-77. Any personnel involved in its recovery are to be escorted out of the site. SCP-98 is not to be moved from its original location, and all attempts to destroy it are highly discouraged.</p><p>Living organisms containing SCP-98 must be secured inside a standard Level 3 caging unit. The food source of these subjects is to be replaced daily by Foundation staff; this is also recommended that subjects be removed from their cage at night so no damage will happen to the caging unit during the night.</p><p>Only D-Class personnel with psychological problems are allowed to interact with SCP-98.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-98 is a type of plant native to the Pacific Northwest. It has four main parts: the main stem, flower head, seed pod, and root stock. SCP-98 possesses the ability to produce human genetic material from its rootstock, thus producing organisms containing it. This ability seems to be connected with lighting or heavy rainfall, causing SCP-98 to release this genetic material into the air through its rootstock.</p><p>The average lifespan of an organism produced with SCP-98 is unknown, however all organisms produced have died by the age of five. The form of an organism produced depends on the environment in which it is born; under a dark sky during nighttime, 1/3 of all organisms are tailless variants and look like small tree frogs while 1/3 are tall black frogs with only legs (referred to as "Mummers"). If a rainstorm occurs at night, 1/6 of all organisms are humanoid in appearance. They will usually stand around 2 meters tall and appear to be either richly dressed or poorly dressed depending on their economic status.</p><p>Due to its nature, subjects created with SCP-98 cannot survive outside of their cage without malnutrition or dehydration.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
