<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-157</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-157 is currently kept in Secure Containment Locker ██ at Site ██. No further testing is to be performed with SCP-157.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-157 is a set of six (6) paper clips, all exactly the same size, shape and weight. Each of these paper clips still has the original packaging on it, including a picture and bar code label on one end. The text on the packaging reads: "Paper Clip for Michaels Office Depot."</p><p>SCP-157 was originally discovered in ██/██/19██, when two newly hired associates at ████████ office supply store began complaining about a strange and unusual item that had been appearing in their deliveries. After two pairs of investigators attempted to retrieve it from its packing, SCP-157 disappeared along with the package.</p><p>No one has been able to find any trace of where SCP-157 came from after the packaging and item were taken away by the delivery man. However, according to the store's inventory records, this package was sold until ██/██/██, when it disappeared as well. Even though each of the items had gone missing before they could be linked back to their specific time period, all records show that they were generally sold over 6 months apart.</p><p>Both shipments included only five (5) items at a time, never more than six (6). All six (6) items have always been the same thing. Each shipment was sent in a plain white envelope labeled "Paper Clip", with no return address on it. Each time that Paper Clip was sold it went out at different times of day and different locations within the store itself.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
