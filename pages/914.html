<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-914</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-914 is to be kept in the Secure Storage Vault at Site-█. SCP-914 should not be removed from its box without Level 4 authorization, and may only be removed from the vault with Level 3 authorization. This restriction has been implemented owing to the potential for lucid dreaming when SCP-914 is left undisturbed for extended periods of time.</p><p>All items listed in SCP-914 should be catalogued according to the following system:</p><p>Items not specifically listed as manufactured by ████ ███████ are to be considered a generic item of unknown provenance, requiring no further action beyond basic documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-914 is a tape labelled with a handwritten label reading 'BACK CATALOGUE'. SCP-914 appears to be constructed from discarded audio cassettes recording at approximately 30-60 kHz. SCP-914 was acquired by Foundation agents in the possession of █████ ███████, a self-styled historian and antique dealer, on 08/██/1975.</p><p>When SCP-914 is placed beside the speaker (or speaker jack) of an audio system capable of reproducing such frequencies, it can be played back from beginning to end by either a person listening to the audio themselves or by an electronic scanning device. This playback—which has been observed to occur over several days' time—takes place at roughly the same speed as normal playback, although when the playback ends, the next audible section of tape will begin playing back immediately. Analysis revealed that all sections of tape appearing in addition to the initial one are identical.</p><p>SCP-914 was compiled by ██████ ████████ between 1972 and 1975 and is a list detailing some ██ anomalous items he has acquired over the years.</p><p>List of Items Acquired</p><p>Item #: SCP-912</p><p>Object Class: Keter</p><p>Special Containment Procedures: All copies of SCP-912 are not to be kept in safe storage locations. Instead, each copy is to be kept in a steel box with indestructible sides and an iron roof located in a remote safe house or research facility. All staff involved in dealing with SCP-912 are required to have Level 3 security clearances; researchers assigned to SCP-912 must undergo psychological evaluations before being permitted more than casual contact with it. All personnel involved with handling SCP-912 are required to submit specimens of their blood for analysis upon termination of assignment.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
