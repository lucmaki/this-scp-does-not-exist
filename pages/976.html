<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-976</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-976 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment chamber.</p><p>During testing, SCP-976 is to be kept covered with a cloth bag. This will prevent any accidental exposure. SCP-976 is allowed to be handled by personnel with Class 3 or higher O.C.D.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-976 appears as a plastic bag measuring 1.2m x 0.5m x 0.4m, with 30cm of those dimensions being the container's surface. The object appeared in ██████, ████████ on 4/3/1989.</p><p>When the bag is opened, SCP-976 will manifest a pair of goggles inside the container that appear to be made of plastic and rubber. These are functional, but are not as durable as human eyes. When worn by an organism, SCP-976's effects will be suppressed by the subject's ocular physiology.</p><p>SCP-976's effects can only be detected by creatures that do not possess ocular organs or other means of detecting light; those affected will not recall having seen SCP-976. Light detection is suppressed even further if SCP-976 is worn over the eyes of such a creature, leading to the belief that SCP-976's wearer is blind.</p><p>The effect of SCP-976 lasts until the subject removes it from their eyes or until they die. In both cases, it will immediately affect all organisms within 3 meters of its wearer. If a subject wearing SCP-976 dies, all other subjects within 30m of its owner will become unable to see light and experience blindness for 7 days after their death.</p><p>SCP-976 was recovered from the home of Mr ████████ ███████████, who reportedly used it to pass on his knowledge about the universe to his friends and family members.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
