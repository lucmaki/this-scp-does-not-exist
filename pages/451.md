<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-451</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-451 is currently contained at Site-46, a facility in the Pacific North West region of the United States. Containment consists of the building's outer fences being electrified and security personnel patrolling the grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-451 is a collection of eighty (80) elongated, interlocked human skeletons. Each skeleton is located in a different spot along the United States-Canadian border, and all are arranged near an irregularly shaped portion of the park land on their respective sides of the line. The collection is oriented in a way that makes it appear as if the skeletons are standing guard, with varying degrees of accuracy at times.</p><p>Twelve (12) larger human skeletons are visible from within the area that has been designated Site-46. These skeletons are visible only from within SCP-451, and all have neck muscles consistent with those of living humans who 'lift' their heads above their shoulders.</p><p>SCP-451 was first discovered on ██/██/20██, when a local environmental activist group 'Broken Ground', consisting of ██████ █████████, █████ █████████ and ██████ ██████████, encountered the anomalous effect while hiking on the edge of Big Muskeg Provincial Park in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. When questioned about possible paranormal activity around Pigeon Lake, several of them reported seeing SCP-451's anomalous effect without having any knowledge or knowledge of its location prior to that. Reportedly, they had experienced it before but dismissed it as wishful thinking or a hallucination caused by factors such as overexertion or dehydration.</p><p>After reporting this anomaly to local authorities, it was discovered that SCP-451 was contained within a small area of land designated Site-46 encompassing less than one percent (1%) of Big Muskeg Provincial Park. Investigation indicated that this area had been used for logging operations for over 100 years previously, though no trees were found within it aside from several old stumps and logs. A remote video camera was used to film the area, and it was determined that the anomalous effect would cease upon the occurrence of specific events such as moving beyond the point where one could see through SCP-451's exterior fence using a camera. Afterwards, further investigation showed that events such as lightning storms and other natural phenomenon would trigger SCP-451's effect once more until they ceased.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
