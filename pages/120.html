<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-120</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-120 must be kept in a storage locker at Site-77. SCP-120 may only be removed from its storage locker for testing purposes and under the supervision of a Level 3 researcher.</p><p>SCP-120 is to be inspected once every two months by level 1 personnel who should determine if it is still in functional condition and report any changes to the project supervisor for maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-120 is a pair of trenchcoat-styled sunglasses (SCP-120-1, SCP-120-2) designed to give the wearer the appearance of being an average human, who stands at 178 cm and weighs 45 kg. The manufacturer claims that it is made with holographic technology and has been tested for years in each market it was released in.</p><p>The glasses are known to have a default color scheme where the outside casing appears to be a dark gray and the inside surface is white. The outside casing is also said to change appearance based on the amount of light it receives, but no further tests have been completed as of yet.</p><p>When worn by an individual with eyesight level below 20/20 (4/4 in distance vision), SCP-120 will alter their appearance to that of one possessing eyesight levels on or above 20/20 (4/4 in distance vision). The user's head will remain unchanged, while they will appear to have perfect vision regardless of what their real eyesight is.</p><p>SCP-120-1: When SCP-120 is not worn, it will appear to be a normal pair of sunglasses. SCP-120-1 has no effect when used against sighted individuals.</p><p>SCP-120-2: When worn by an individual, SCP-120-2 will change color depending on how many fingers they use to identify themselves as belonging to non-humanoid species. Different fingers will change colors at different frequencies; all fingers currently recorded as belonging to nonhumanoid species are purple (including digits 2 through 5). If more than two fingers are used at once to identify the user's race, SCP-120 will register a frequency equal to the body parts it covers divided by 3 and then multiplied by 7. For example, if someone were to wear both SCP-120 and SCP-500, their appearance would change from purple mass composed of fingers belonging to nonhumanoids, to white mass composed of an unknown combination of fingers belonging only to humanoid creatures.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
