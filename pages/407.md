<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-407</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The perimeter of SCP-407 is to be patrolled at all times. Instances of SCP-407 are located in a small containment coffer and are to be kept in a standard humanoid containment pouch.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-407 are 54 human test subjects who have been infected with the SCP-407 virus and will appear as a humanoid entity when no more humans can be found. Instances of SCP-407 may be identified by their lack of blood and organs.</p><p>The only known method to recover a host is to kill the instance of SCP-407. The body will appear harmless until the body's skin is removed. Once the outer layer is removed, the skin will begin to shrivel and spark, leaving behind a blackened corpse in which the eyes are red with bloodshot pupils and empty sockets.</p><p>SCP-407 is a highly infectious and contagious disease carried via a dormant form in various species of insects and arachnids. Only two known methods of spreading the disease have been found:</p><p>There is no known cure for SCP-407 except for the death of the infected host. Infected bodies will not show signs of infection until the skin has been removed; once the skin has been removed, victims will begin to deteriorate rapidly until death occurs within one day (See Addendum 1). Victims are also highly susceptible to dehydration and malnutrition. Victims lose approximately 10% bodily fluids daily, with severe cases losing up to 25% daily. Death will occur from dehydration after 3-5 days unless treated with intravenous fluids or advanced medical care.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
