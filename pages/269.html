<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-269</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-269 requires to be handled in a gold case from now on, including during transportation. The case must always remain closed and locked.</p><p>The Foundation is to maintain a containment team at the location of SCP-269's discovery. All conversations with SCP-269 are to be recorded, transcribed and reported to Dr O███.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-269 is a blue crystal, measuring 0.62 centimeters in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. SCP-269's anomalous effects only occur near SCP-269 itself, or when it is physically handled by the human hand.</p><p>SCP-269's effect occurs when it is taken in the hand, seemingly causing a "magic moment" that disconnects the surrounding environment from the brainwaves of the subject. The subject will soon slip into a coma-like state, which lasts between one and three minutes before abruptly ending.</p><p>If any other lifeform touches SCP-269 during this time, they will experience similarly disconnected reality as the original subject, with most notably no memory of their previous existence or possession of SCP-269.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
