<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-226</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-226 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment locker at Site-28. Personnel working with or in the area of SCP-226 are to wear full body protection and eye protection during application of SCP-226.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-226 is a pair of flesh-coloured silicone earplugs. SCP-226 weighs 35 grams and is 6.8 mm in diameter, with a length of 13.5 mm. SCP-226 has smooth bumps on each end, similar in shape to the physiological pressure receptors in an ear.</p><p>SCP-226 inhibits the filtering out of external stimuli by the human auditory system, making it appear as if sounds are significantly louder than they actually are to any given individual wearing them. This effect is greatly amplified when the wearer is listening with both ears at once, but reduces substantially when listening with only one ear.</p><p>In addition to its anomalous effects on hearing, SCP-226 also causes auditory hallucinations to occur when worn, triggered by virtually any loud sound regardless of its source or nature. The exact nature and content of these hallucinations vary from subject to subject. Occasionally, subjects will report hearing voices that speak in languages they do not know.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
