<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-702</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-702 is to be kept in an airtight, climate-controlled chamber. The chamber is to be made of steel with a double layer of 1 cm thick polyethylene sheeting mounted on three sides. Surrounding the containment area are layers of polystyrene, fibreglass insulation, and a 6 m layer of concrete. A minimum of 8 cm of concrete is to surround the containment area and be lifted by an average level foundation for added security.</p><p>No personnel other than SCP-702 is allowed within 4 meters of the anomaly at any time. Guards should patrol the perimeter of this restricted area at all times, and remain vigilant for any signs of contamination or tampering by unauthorized personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-702 is a pair of female humanoid entities, approximately 3 m tall, with muscular bodies and musculature. SCP-702 is biologically male, but has been anomalously transformed into women by a unique and unknown species whose physiology is not compatible with human biology.</p><p>SCP-702's skin colour is a light grey tone, matching their bone structure and muscle tissues. The female entities' skin has the texture of putty (harder than human skin) and will not tear or tear easily.</p><p>SCP-802 is considered the 'normal' form of SCP-702, while SCP-703 appears to be physically 81 kg heavier than its partner. The male entity's arm movements are noticeably slower compared to its female counterpart.</p><p>SCP-703 appears to have physical limitations whereas SCP-702 displays no such limitations. SCP-703 also displays an abnormal resistance to damage caused by physical forces, requiring a higher amount of force to break through their skin than that of normal humans. For example, a steel ball impacting on their chest muscle would result in injury for humans, but not for SCP-703.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
