<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-500</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-500 is to be contained in a 1m x 2m x 2m cell. Its structure, excluding the limbs and head, is to be shielded from potential objects of interest by an opaque cover measuring 0.5m thick. It is not to be moved from this cell without approval from at least two (2) personnel familiar with the object. A camera within the cell records all voluntary activities undertaken by SCP-500.</p><p>Records of its designation are to be kept on paper tape so that re-designation is always possible and easier than previous attempts. Any further changes in classification are only to be made by three (3) individuals of Level 3 clearance or higher. Should the designation change, the new designation is to be written on a new piece of paper with an indelible ink so that its number cannot be changed. SCP-500 is to be fed human flesh four (4) times daily and human blood once a week, via intravenous access. Additional blood may also be added if deemed necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-500 is a male humanoid entity of unidentifiable origin. It still maintains a body structure similar to a human being, with the exception of its skin, which has become extremely resistant to damage. SCP-500's skeleton has also become more muscular and durable.</p><p>SCP-500 has an abnormally strong tolerance towards pain and can withstand knifes, bullets or other forms of hard physical trauma in a manner not seen in humans. When sustained by pain stimuli, it displays no signs of distress and instead remains composed.</p><p>SCP-500 is highly intelligent and learns new behaviors after observing them being performed by others. It is capable of mimicking facial expressions and hand gestures; when directed to "smile", SCP-500 will display an expression that they have learned to associate with satisfaction or pleasantness. However, there are no signs of genuine emotion from SCP-500, even when it performs acts that cause it suffering.</p><p>SCP-500's vocal chords do not function as well as those of a human being and it speaks in a distorted voice mimicking speech patterns used in English language. It demonstrates rudimentary knowledge of various subjects, including mathematics, history and astronomy, yet its education is limited due to the physical constraints imposed on it by seemingly unknown forces that prevent access to any kind of structured educational setting.</p><p>SCP-500 will offer limited information on itself if asked directly but displays little interest in talking about its origins or past memories. The only thing it seems interested in talking about are the Jack The Ripper murders that occurred in 1888.</p><p>When asked about Jack The Ripper, it will relate stories about the murders that he is aware of without fail whenever told about his crimes prior to this specific event as well as random accounts about incidents in other parts of the world involving unidentified individuals who acted similarly to him.</p><p>Despite its mental stability, SCP-500 is not immune to normal human emotions such as fear, anger and confusion. SCP-500 has been known to exhibit fear when subjected to intense physical punishment (such as being struck repeatedly on the back with an iron bar) or when exposed to extreme situations where survival is not possible (such as being hit at high speed by an automobile while driving). This was true even before its transformation into a sentient entity. When placed in extreme conditions (such as being submerged in water for several hours at a time) or confronted with sudden danger (such as facing off against another person who has been attacking it), SCP-500 will try to flee or escape from the situation while displaying all the signs of physical pain that would be expected from an organic entity experiencing such life threatening scenarios.</p><p>The following interview was conducted in order to find out more about SCP-500's relation with these events.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
