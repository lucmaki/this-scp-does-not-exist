<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-276</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-276 is to be contained in a standard containment locker at Site-19, accessible by Level-2 personnel only. In the event of an emergency involving SCP-276, 1 (one) D-Class subject must be utilized to remove the object from the containment unit and return it to its original location after the event.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-276 is a large bottle of champagne in the shape of a fire hydrant, capable of holding up to 600ml of liquid. When opened, SCP-276 emits no aggressive behavior, and is non-anomalous in regards to other anomalous objects produced by SCP-████. The only event in which SCP-276 displays anomalous properties is on New Year's Eve, where it functions as an amplifier for any noise within its vicinity.</p><p>When tested with varying acoustic signals, no uncommon phenomena have been observed from SCP-276 except for an increase in noise within the range of approximately 600 Hz to 1.2 kHz. Although this increase in noise has been shown to affect animals as well as humans, it was determined that both were under the effects of alcohol and therefore had a diminished perception of sound frequencies.</p><p>If the subject has consumed alcohol prior to testing at a volume sufficient to produce hearing loss, SCP-276 will cause permanent hearing damage.</p><p>Closing Statement: No further tests are required on SCP-276, as tests involving it pose little danger to test subjects and all information gathered on it has already been published by Dr. ███████ in Incident Report 276-1.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
