<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-949</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-949 is currently contained in a secured containment chamber, located in Site-██. In the event of an emergency, all personnel participating in the removal or destruction of SCP-949 are to be Class A amnesticized and kept sedated until return to the site.</p><p>No items created by SCP-949 have been produced as of yet. The Foundation has carried out extensive research on creating a non-anomalous equivalent, with several candidates being submitted for testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-949 is a woman, in her 30s or 40s, between 1.8 and 2 meters, who possesses the anomalous qualities of a non-anomalous human female. As such, she is capable of reproduction and has experienced menses and pregnancy. However, SCP-949 possesses the ability to spontaneously produce a non-anomalous human male, who is identical to standard samples of the species Homo sapiens sapiens.</p><p>SCP-949 is also able to create a substance which appears to have human DNA, but has ██████ as its base structure. When administered to a living organism, this "placenta" rapidly metabolizes whatever nutrients it contains into ██ ████████████ (██ ████████ D) within 8 seconds and rapidly absorbs all fluids from whatever organism it is placed in. This process successfully creates a living human male with genetic material identical to that possessed by SCP-949.</p><p>Approximately 15 minutes after SCP-949 produces this "placenta", it will begin to bond with any nearby humans, forming an additional anomalous organ within their bodies. After approximately 10 hours of this process occurring, the placenta will undergo what appears to be partial necrosis around the time of the subject's birth. The placenta will then dissolve into nothing over the course of 72 hours, leaving no evidence that it was ever present in their body.</p><p>The child produced by SCP-949 manifests itself in a location outside of the umbilical cord's effective range, between 50 meters and 200 kilometers depending on atmospheric conditions (approximately 80% accuracy). This location resembles that of an abandoned building or rural home. During this period, no sensory input can be detected by all sighted observers (including those using long range imaging devices).</p><p>After 2 weeks following the birth and disappearance of any placenta attached to them, these subjects will manifest secondary anomalous properties similar to those possessed by SCP-949 herself:</p><p>Additional Notes: Due to the large number of subjects produced by SCP-949's method of propagation, testing for extra features has been limited until further notice.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
