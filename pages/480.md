<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-480</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A specialized team of containment agents (referred to as M-480s) tasked with the recovery and entrapment of SCP-480 are to be stationed at each exit connecting Site ██ to the outside world. In the event that SCP-480 escapes from its current location, several teams of Foundation agents are to be dispatched to intercept and neutralize SCP-480.</p><p>Attacks against SCP-480 are to be confined to the period between 0200–0900, when SCP-480 normally travels and performs experiments. Furthermore, all individuals attempting to directly interact with SCP-480 during this time have been deemed high risk targets.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-480 is the designation given to a humanoid entity (designated SCP-480-1) residing in the site of ██████. SCP-480 is equipped with both cybernetic and biological limbs and is able to grasp objects in its vicinity using both mechanical manipulators and biological fingers. SCP-480 possesses several types of sensors throughout both its body, including an internal tracking system, as well as external sensors used for navigation. SCP-480 is able to adapt to various environments through alterations in its body structure, such as the addition or removal of biological/bionically constructed parts.</p><p>Specifically, SCP-480 has been observed frequently changing parts of its anatomy based on the environment it operates in; these organs are not necessarily directly involved with the function of its body but are integral for surviving within that environment. For example, SCP-480 can move its digestive tract into different positions within its human-like torso depending on when and where it feeds.</p><p>SCP-480 also possesses numerous weapons which it could use in combat should it be attacked by hostile entities such as humans. These include:</p><p>As well as a singular "projectile" for indirect use against hostile entities; this object appears to have been created from a fleshy mass and bears a striking resemblance to human male genitalia.</p><p>SCP-480 was originally discovered on ██/██/██, after an unusual number of murders began occurring at a hotel located in ██████, England. The Hotel ██████ has since been bought by Foundation management, and all claims made against SCP-480 have been deemed false or fictitious on investigation. Prior to this event, no murders had ever taken place at the hotel nor had any evidence occurred connecting any of the previous owners to the murders. Despite being capable of operating outside of Site ██ and engaging in unapproved behavior, no reports have ever linked it with anomalous properties prior to this incident, nor does it appear to be inherently anomalous other than those listed above.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
