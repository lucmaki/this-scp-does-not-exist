<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-287</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-287 is locked in storage unit #21. Access to the item is restricted to Site recreation staff. A cover story has been devised, involving spontaneous combustion of a non-anomalous fire hydrant, as a preventative measure against containment breach.</p><p>Personnel who use this object are to be monitored for signs of SCP-287's effect. D-Class and other expendable personnel may be used for experimentation if necessary. No testing is to occur outdoors, or on any civilian population larger than 500 people. Foundation personnel involved in testing are required to wear Level 4 lead radiation face masks at all times. The use of SCP-287 may only be undertaken by personnel with clearance level 3 or higher. Current maximum level of suspected clearance is ████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-287 is a fake fire hydrant constructed from fiberglass and metal, installed in an unnamed public park in █████████████, Michigan. Installed at the center of the park is a small, glass-encased gasoline pump with a hose attached to it, which can be connected to a tap or hose provided by the observer. When lifted up, the device exhales highly flammable aerosol mist that spreads out of its mouth and ignites upon contact with oxygen. It has been determined that this is not an actual functional fire hydrant, but rather an incendiary weapon designed to target civilian populations.</p><p>SCP-287's effect will only work on humans; animals and other non-human creatures are ignored. The effect manifests itself in 15-30 minutes (average 20), though testing has shown that exact time will vary depending on weather conditions and proximity to the device. The aerosol will spread for roughly 3 blocks before burning out. The spread cannot be stopped by reductive means such as blankets, webs or other barriers. As damage from SCP-287 takes place over several hours, there is nothing to prevent large scale damage through deliberate ignition of nearby fuel sources and outlets.</p><p>SCP-287's effect appears to be partially psychological; several captured test subjects believed themselves to be on fire after being exposed to the aerosol mist. Subjects who were not convinced by this illusion were treated for burns and identified as "deceased". It is believed that these individuals may have shouted phrases such as "I'm on fire!", "It's burning!" or "The building's on fire!" while they were under SCP-287's effects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
