<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-224</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-224 is to be kept in a standard containment locker decorated with an image of SCP-224 in its inactive state. Containers of any kind are not to be placed inside it. Any personnel working with SCP-224 must wear decontamination suites before entering the containment room, and attach them to their suits as they leave.</p><p>As SCP-224 has shown the ability to activate or deactivate itself at will, testing rules 1 through 3 need not apply; however, the presence of a subject must be confirmed via live video footage on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-224 appears to be an empty glass jar containing a liquid of some sort, normally appearing as a dark orange color. The liquid contains various types of bacteria and other microscopic organisms, including N2-type aerobic bacteria, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Candida albicans.</p><p>When a living organism comes into contact with the liquid inside SCP-224, it immediately begins to secrete a large quantity of the aforementioned microorganisms.</p><p>The subjects affected by SCP-224 appear to be oblivious to the presence of these microorganisms, even if they are in close proximity. This effect is only noticeable in long-term laboratory testing. Over 90% of subjects tested report discomfort in the lower abdomen area. However, the subject will continue to work on the assigned task until the discomfort eventually subsides after several hours or days.</p><p>Testing has shown that if the subject is distracted in any way during this time, such as talking to another subject or a researcher, their symptoms will increase quickly and prove difficult to handle. If left alone for long periods of time without distraction, this symptom will increase significantly and cause more severe reactions than would normally occur.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
