<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-687</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-687 is contained in a standard containment locker at Site-77. The locker is to be fitted with an independent air handling system, one opening for gas removal, one for replacement, and two intake openings; this system is to be checked at least once a month. The locker itself is to be monitored for tampering and any anomaly related to the containment of SCP-687 is to be reported immediately to the Level 3 security staff.</p><p>All persons or objects who come in contact with SCP-687 are to wear full body protective Hazmat suits at all times when near or inside the containment area of SCP-687. Any personnel entering SCP-687's containment area are not permitted to remove their masks until they have been decontaminated and are deemed to be safe and stable by level 3 personnel. After being decontaminated and approved, a hazmat suit can be removed without further permission from assigned security personnel. Due to the nature of SCP-687, it is recommended that only Level 4 personnel enter SCP-687's containment area, with Level 5 personnel as backups if necessary.</p><p>Any personnel attempting to exit the containment area of SCP-688 must first report their status to level 3 security station. Only security staff may enter SCP-687's containment area and enter the airlock unless level 3 personnel deem it safe for them to do so. All members of security are trained in double or triple hand entry techniques, where you place both hands in front of you and push against each other before exiting the airlock.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-687 is a strange form of matter which inherently changes shape and form depending on the configuration of its containment area. The more restrictive, less accessible areas of SCP-687 are the most resistant to change. Due to this, it is theorised that the airlock leading into SCP-687's containment area is the only "safe" way for personnel to enter and exit SCP-687 (this does not apply to testing with D-class personnel, as D-class personnel do not have standard methods of containment).</p><p>SCP-687 has three primary forms:</p><p>Two new forms have been observed in testing:</p><p>SCP-687's functions and capabilities are all dependent on its configuration in its containment area, whether it be inside or outside. One notable difference between samples of SCP-688 is how long they take to take form on a flat surface compared to their various configurations in water.</p><p>SCP-687's most dangerous ability is its complete lack of control over the conditions of the containment area it inhabits. All attempts to force it outside of these conditions result in failure. This knowledge gives us some idea of how dangerous this anomaly could be to an unprotected population. It also means that ingress and egress through SCP-687's airlock cannot be controlled easily or reliably enough to be helpful in maintaining containment.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
