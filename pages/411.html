<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-411</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The goal of SCP-411 is to create a positive, long-term effect on the behavior of animal life on Earth. All animals that meet the criteria listed below have been designated as part of SCP-411.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-411 is comprised of animals that display empathy for other animals or humans. This empathy causes them to avoid unnecessary deaths, even if it means it causes their own death. Currently listed are:</p><p>As of May 13th, 2017, the classification is still pending.</p><p>The animals eligible for SCP-411 designation were chosen because they demonstrated the ability to act in a nonhumanistic way, but their actions had no known effect on their own survival.</p><p>Upon designation as part of SCP-411, each subject is given extensive psychological counseling and meditation therapy and are monitored by researchers 24 hours a day. All subjects listed above are housed at Site 77. Any animal capable of being part of SCP-411 is a potential candidate for the program.</p><p>Animal testing within SCP-411 has been suspended; however, further testing approved by Site 77's Senior Staff Protocol Committee is still possible.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
