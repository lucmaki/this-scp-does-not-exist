<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-980</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-980 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, furnished with a bed, bathroom facilities, and an electronic video game console. SCP-980 is to be fed two (2) meals a day, consisting of at least two (2) hundred and fifty (250) grams of meat or fish, together with twice as much fruit and an additional one hundred grams of rice. SCP-980 is not allowed to consume any other food items. Drinks are allowed to SCP-980 only when it goes on a hunger strike.</p><p>All personnel involved in testing SCP-980 must wear full body protective equipment, including respiratory masks equipped with filtration systems, gloves made out of thick rubberized fabrics, and boots, which are lined with steel plating. Any personnel involved in testing SCP-980 should be aware that SCP-980 can inflict severe physical harm upon any individuals who have not been properly protected, and should follow all safety precautions at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-980 is a Caucasian male, approximately two (2) meters tall, weighing 110 kilograms. SCP-980's head is large and misshapen, slightly sloping backwards, with a common shape of most individuals of its race. SCP-980 appears to have a strange deformity in its left eye, which has been described as "very deep", "very dark", or "completely black". The same dark spot can be seen on the right side of SCP-980's face. The deformity of SCP-980's left eye is invisible with the naked eye, but appears to be a small area of bruise on the inside surface of SCP-980's eye.</p><p>When subjects are exposed to high levels of radiation, SCP-980 will approach them and attempt to communicate with them in an unknown tongue. When asked about its purpose for doing so, SCP-980 has responded that it wishes to gain knowledge from humans. However, all attempts by SCP-980 to communicate with humans have failed. Documentation from initial testing indicates that approximately fifty percent of human subjects who encounter SCP-980 report being able to understand what it is saying. The other half were unable to understand anything said by SCP-980. It appears that people who are insensitive to radiation are unable to understand what SCP-980 says. Subjects who do not appear sensitive to radiation still find the language spoken by SCP-980 hard to comprehend, but they seem to understand more than those who are sensitive to radiation.</p><p>SCP-980 will only talk with subjects who have been exposed to high levels of radiation within three (3) hours of exposure. Further testing has indicated that subjects who have been exposed to low levels of radiation less than three (3) hours after exposure do not respond when spoken to by SCP-980. It appears that the longer a subject remains in contact with SCP-980 without being exposed to high levels of radiation, the more difficult it becomes for him or her to understand what it says.</p><p>In addition to talking with those who are exposed to high levels of radiation, SCP-980 will also make attempts at conversation with those who are not subjected to radiation at all. Though it becomes very difficult for humans not subjected to radiation to speak intelligibly to it at first, it does not seem intractable in this regard; researchers have noted that if one does not speak too quickly when trying to communicate with it, and makes an effort at speech that suggests intelligence and rationality on the part of the person speaking - despite the fact that most such attempts will fall on deaf ears - then it is possible for humans not subjected directly or indirectly to high levels of radiation (including D class personnel) to carry on a conversation with it over time without fail.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
