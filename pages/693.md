<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-693</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-693 is to be contained in a secure concrete containment cell, located in Site 17. A single window has been placed at the front of the object; SCP-693 is not to be removed from this area. The monitoring station is to remain staffed 24/7 with two guards. Any personnel entering the chamber are to report any deviations in its condition immediately, and are not to remove SCP-693 from the viewing area without permission.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-693 is a standard photographic printing press, albeit an exceptionally large one. It appears to be in near-perfect working order, and was assembled by the same manufacturer as another press of its size and model. The object's printing plate area is covered in a layer of plaster, varying in thickness from 0.5 mm to 3 cm. It also includes a blank sheet of paper.</p><p>SCP-693 displays anomalous properties when removed from its cell, or when it is filled with printing ink or other chemicals capable of interacting with light. When these conditions are met, it will begin to produce a variety of images and text. These do not follow any recognizable design scheme, and are produced in a random manner. Although these images will sometimes include visible people or animals, most resemble abstractions of various shapes and colors.</p><p>If an image is printed onto paper using SCP-693 with ink, it will not produce any further anomalous effects until the paper is processed into paper pulp or some other material that can be used for reproduction. Ink printed on parchment or papyrus will have the same anomalous effect, but will behave differently when they are processed into paper products that do not require ink to be created again. Images on cloth cannot be reproduced normally even if they are printed directly onto the material instead of being placed on paper — those recovered so far have been produced only after being sewn onto garments designed for this specific purpose.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
