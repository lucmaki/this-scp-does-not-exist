<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-126</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-126 is currently contained in a standard containment locker. These cells are to be inspected annually, and any damage the object may have caused is to be repaired. Any changes in the object's character are to be reported immediately and investigated. Personnel handling SCP-126 are not permitted to have their wrists bound until after testing and should wear gloves in case of accidental exposure. During testing, personnel handling SCP-126 must sign a liability waiver, as requested for all SCPs.</p><p>All exterior and interior windows (including LCD displays) in the wing of Site-76 containing SCP-126 must be covered in opaque plastic for their immediate maintenance by Mobile Task Force Phi-4 ("The Watchdogs"). Should the integrity of Site-76's exterior walls or windows be compromised, MTF Phi-4 is to provide immediate backup from outside the facility on the nearest Foundation helipad.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-126 is a miniature, black toy robot approximately fifteen centimeters tall. SCP-126 is powered by a rechargeable battery pack located in its chest cavity, and every thirty days must be recharged to retain functionality. However, due to the simplicity of SCP-126's design and components, it is easily reparable with standard hand tools.</p><p>SCP-126 is impervious to non-physical damage such as corrosion, cutting, or blunt force trauma. Damage caused by physical impact does not affect SCP-126. When damaged or corroded by physical means, SCP-126 will attempt to repair itself over the course of one hour.</p><p>The only tool required to repair SCP-126 is an eraser. Any object capable of removing lead pencil markings from most surfaces can remove all remaining traces of damage from SCP-126. Reported methods used include saliva and saliva containing enzymes, water (from a hose), battery acid, and many other methods not yet explored by staff at Site-76. Removal has no adverse effect on SCP-126; however, the object will appear to have been deformed during repairs when viewed under magnification or when in a reflective surface. The object appears to reinstate its original shape after each repair.</p><p>Prior to being brought into custody, SCP-126 was discovered progressively disassembling itself at a rate over twenty thousand times faster than normal for a conventional high school chemistry project (See Addendum 126). Testing of both SCP-126 and the chemical that was causing the phenomenon have thus far failed to produce any results furthering our understanding of this anomaly; however in light of previous research findings it appeared prudent to keep the object contained until more information could be obtained.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
