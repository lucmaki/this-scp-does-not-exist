<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-956</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-956 is to be kept in a standard test chamber at Site-███, with one (1) cover to be removed from the chamber as needed. Every three (3) months, SCP-956 must be fed two (2) small meals of raw chicken. In addition, approximately once a year, SCP-956 should be sprayed down with deionized water and allowed to air dry for four (4) minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-956 is a small grayish-white rodent with gray fur and dark brown eyes. Its head is somewhat larger than its body, with the skull being thinner than that of most rodents. The animal's fur is dense but shorter than that of most rodents, and it appears to have no tail.</p><p>SCP-956 will occasionally gnaw on any solid surface available to it, especially in areas where it has previously lived. If these surfaces are not provided as food or shelter, SCP-956 will instead begin to scratch at them with its claws. It is unknown if this behavior is a form of self-defense or an attempt at communication. Once an area has been scratched through four (4) times, it will begin to show signs of wear. If left in its current state for longer than three months, it will begin to crack and crumble.</p><p>SCP-956 may also be found scratching on the inside of its containment chamber; however, this behavior has never been observed outside of testing. Maintenance personnel must make arrangements to keep SCP-956's containment chamber clean and free from scratches; otherwise, SCP-956 may present a health risk to others within the facility through its tendency to bite or scratch.</p><p>SCP-956 was recovered from ████████, CA in 1997 after local hunters were alerted by SCP-956's constant scratching and gnawing on trees and fences in the area. Foundation agents arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and secured SCP-956 without incident.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
