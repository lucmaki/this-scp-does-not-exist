<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-75</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-75 is contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, equipped with a camera, two speakers and a microphone. It is to be fed human food on a daily basis, but otherwise its containment chamber is not to be disturbed by researchers or security personnel.</p><p>The walls and ceiling of the containment chamber must be replaced annually due to SCP-75's ability to alter the structure at will. The new materials must be resistant to fire damage, as well as having an acoustic resistance of 10 dB. (See Testing Log, SCP-75 for details.)</p><p>When SCP-75 exhibits suicidal or other harmful behavior, it is to be tranquilized immediately. Once tranquilized it may be restrained in whatever manner is needed to prevent self-harm.</p><p>SCP-75 may be used as an experimental subject for arbitrary testing. However no tests involving any dangerous situations are to be initiated without written permission from the medical staff. This includes (but is not limited to) the following:</p><p>"Your request has been denied."</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-75 is a 35 cm tall humanoid entity, with grey skin and hair. It has two powerful retractable claws, two eyes on the sides of its head, and two larger eyes in the front of its head. SCP-75 communicates through a small device resembling an electric guitar pick.</p><p>SCP-75's behavior is highly erratic. It has nearly no control over its actions when hostile or in distress (see Incident Log). When calm it will play music, primarily acoustic blues and jazz, using the pick-like device for the strings. When agitated, it goes into a trance state described as "painful neurological stimulation". This stage is characterized by:</p><p>According to interviews with SCP-75 (During this stage, SCP-75 cannot be restrained), it claims to be able to do anything at any time, including:</p><p>SCP-75 was originally discovered in ██████████, Oregon as a homeless musician with no known connections to Foundation or other anomalous organizations. The Foundation was contacted in February 2000 after multiple reports of paranormal activity related to SCP-75 were submitted by residents of ████████, Oregon.</p><p>Investigation: On interview request #5539206848982357959 ████████ police department explained the following:</p><p>Upon investigation area, SCP-75 was discovered inside an abandoned warehouse behind ████████'s primary school. Surveillance footage showed SCP-75 wandering around without any serious injuries while playing several pieces on an acoustic guitar before resolving into a violent outburst against the building and attempting to climb out of a window. The building collapsed after approximately two seconds of SCP-75's attempt at escape; nothing else was damaged during that time.</p><p>The school had been abandoned for approximately 20 years prior to its collapse due to damage caused by fire and vandalism from students. No incidents of SCP-75 interacting with the building survived even basic documentation efforts on recordkeeping equipment at the time (1977–1982). The owners of the vacant lot were contacted and said that "something" had been living in their basement for 10–14 years despite having no history of domestic pets. The current occupants claim that they have never seen or heard anything unusual during their residence.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
