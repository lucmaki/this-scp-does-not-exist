<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-661</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-661 has been marked with a yellow warning sign by the Foundation. The laboratory where SCP-661 is held is currently under constant video surveillance, and all personnel entering the room are to be photographed and drug tested before entering. Any personnel found to be in possession of more than 0.3 micrograms of SCP-661 on any given day will be immediately terminated for security reasons.</p><p>A large locker in the same room stores samples of normal atoms present in the environment around the facility, with samples from previous days kept in an identical locker located on the other side of the room. This room should not be entered except by Class 3 clearance or above.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-661 is the radioactive version of neutronium, an extremely rare element. Its anomalous properties manifest when more than 0.3 micrograms of SCP-661 are present in the bloodstream of any individual at any given time.</p><p>The effects that occur due to this exposure vary with each exposure, but always involve others; anyone in physical contact with SCP-661 will undergo some form of mutation before dying within three days. The exact nature of these mutations depends on the amount of exposure to SCP-661, but they always include the following:</p><p>SCP-661's effect on non-human organisms is significantly reduced, causing only minor changes to their appearance and behavior patterns. These changes are not noticeable unless close examination is conducted for several years, and have been recorded as early as ██ days after exposure.</p><p>When the subject dies, a new instance of SCP-661 takes 106 seconds to form. This law appears to apply regardless of whether the subject was human or not. Existing instances are destroyed by normal disintegration after one hour, but if they run out of matter they continue to exist as a pure mass of radiation resistant to all known types of damage.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
