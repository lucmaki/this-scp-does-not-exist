<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-557</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-557 is to be kept in a climate-controlled storage case when not in use. Exposure of external SCP-557-1 to direct sunlight is to be avoided, and its location must be kept a secret from all Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-557 is a copy of The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. When it is exposed to direct sunlight, SCP-557 will mutate into a new object resembling any printed text that was printed in its place. If no printed text has existed recently, an endless number of printed texts will be created until the paper is destroyed. Once modified, SCP-557 will not revert back to its original form unless repeatedly submerged in water or shadowed by an opaque surface.</p><p>SCP-557 was recovered from the offices of philately-mania Foundation front company "The Hetrus" on 5/17/1954, following the disappearance of approximately ██ "Hetrus"-branded stamps from postal systems throughout Europe, Asia, Australia and North America.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
