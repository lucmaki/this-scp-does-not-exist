<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-728</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The building housing SCP-728 is to be maintained by Site-28 personnel. No personnel are to enter SCP-728 or its three floors without prior written approval from an O-4 level researcher. Entrance to SCP-728 is to be regulated by the presence of Class V amnestics and a Level 3 clearance. Access to the basement level is restricted to Level 4 security clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-728 is an abandoned building located in ██████████, Maryland, United States. SCP-728 is accessible through a floor and basement entrance. SCP-728 has underground parking and maintenance areas. SCP-728 is composed of forty apartments with varying architectural styles, arranged in five floors. The building's entrance and basement are blocked by cement doors similar to those that would be found in the lobby of a typical apartment complex. Each floor has a stairway, which rises from a common reception area to the basement level. The walls of each room are adorned with various artwork, newspaper clippings, and personal artifacts from the residents of the apartment complex. All paintings are signed with the name "Swan".</p><p>Each apartment contains one individual in unclothed states of infancy or early childhood; these individuals appear to be dead. Nonhuman infant bodies are frequently observed outside their rooms, at which time all instances of SCP-728 will vanish from the building. All remains found were human specimens and were perishing from the effects of starvation or dehydration, evidence of cannibalism having been discovered on several occasions. All victims claimed to have no memory of their life before they entered SCP-728, but all had birthmarks on the palms consistent with markings left by SCP-106 or SCP-882 (see incident log 728-01).</p><p>No serial number was recorded on any corpses recovered, suggesting that all instances are related by genetics and birthdate. All children have been subjected to pallor, malnutrition, and dehydration; many victims have succumbed to these factors while still alive. Only one child has survived into adulthood without defect or disturbance: ██ years after she entered SCP-728, [REDACTED]. For further information on this child please see document 728-03.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
