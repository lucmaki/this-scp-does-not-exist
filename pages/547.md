<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-547</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-547 is currently located in a standard containment locker (purchase of an extra lockbox is recommended). The box is to be kept in a locked room with no windows. The room itself is to be stripped of any potential hazards such as loose flooring and sharp objects, with the exception of the item itself.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-547 is a standard black 4″ x 6″ toolbox with a standard lock. When opened, personnel will be greeted with a message written upon the inside of the lid:</p><p>“Class makes you smarter!”</p><p>Opening the box will immediately cause all persons within earshot to become very uncomfortable and begin to completely lose their grip on whatever they are holding. The object(s) in their hand(s) will begin to move about erratically and uncontrollably for an indeterminate period of time until the box is closed again. While moving about, instruments (such as those used in surgery) will become increasingly more unmanageable until finally becoming completely hazardous. Other objects (such as electronic devices) will begin to function at random, although nobody but the subject able to see its inner workings is able to understand why.</p><p>The effect has been shown to be constant and cannot be suppressed by standard means. Once the effect has not been released for 45 minutes, the subject will experience severe anxiety and general discomfort. Once this has reached a certain point, regardless of how many objects are affected by SCP-547, the individual will become violently ill and vomit repeatedly until they lose consciousness. The number of subjects affected varies greatly between each test, with previous tests having failed due to damage inflicted upon the subjects by their own poorly controlled objects.</p><p>SCP-547 was first discovered after an employee attempted to use it during class at Site-42's training facility. After more than 25 students had been affected and numerous instructors lost control of their equipment, Site Command decided that further testing could not be allowed. However, further experimentation on D-class personnel was approved following Incident 547-G28D2U6R4R9B1U7B4U6UR1U7D2U6BR2U7DR2U6BR3U7B4U6XTX547.</p><p>Incident 547-G28D2U6R4R9B1U7B4U6UR1U7D2U6BR2U7DR2U6BR3U7B4U6XTX547: A large number of Class-A amnestic drugs were delivered to Site-42's hospital in an unmarked envelope following an anonymous tip by telephone. Once deposited into Area-22's Level 4 sedation room, two security guards were instructed to place all subjects contained therein into a small sleeping bag while another guard moved all objects within reach of Area-22's bedsides into a large wastebag.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
