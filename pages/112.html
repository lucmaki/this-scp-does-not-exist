<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-112</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-112 is currently kept in a steel storage locker in Site-64. Due to its size and unwieldy nature, SCP-112 is to be kept at a maximum of fifty (50) meters from any Foundation personnel or civilians who come into contact with it. The exterior walls of the containment locker are lined with lead shielding.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-112 is a humanoid entity with an approximate height of 1.5 meters, weighing 8.5 kg, and black eyes that reflect an iridescent turquoise blue. SCP-112 stands upright and walks on two legs, with a pair of wings protruding from its back. The wings are composed of lightweight tanned leather and measure 2 m long by 0.2 m wide at their widest point.</p><p>SCP-112 appears to be a man or woman dressed in the Victorian era; however, because of its animalistic physiology, it is unknown whether it is capable of biological reproduction. (See Interview Log 112.)</p><p>SCP-112's skin and feathers are heavily mutated to be more resistant to damage from exposure to water, having become waterproof and fireproof respectively. A "furry" tail growing out of the base of its spine also serves as a sensory organ that can detect changes in the environment through olfaction. The other organs are consistent with those of a human being.</p><p>SCP-112 has an unusual metabolism, processing food through its skin rather than through digestion as humans do. Rather than eating solid foods, SCP-112 consumes magentum powder (formally known as nefellium) via inhalation until it reaches saturation point; this powder is metallic in appearance due to its high levels of iron and sulfur content.</p><p>Magentum powder is highly flammable and explosive when ignited, causing severe burns to SCP-112's internal organs as well as burning away its hair follicles. SCP-112 cannot feel pain or pleasure during this process, only suffering discomfort until it processes all the powder. If it is not fed additional nefellium during this process, SCP-112 dies within three days due to starvation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
