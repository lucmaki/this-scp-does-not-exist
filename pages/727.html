<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-727</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All records of SCP-727-1 events have been expunged from public records and journals. Periodic psychic incursion scans are to be conducted on research subjects who have reported memory loss of encounters with SCP-727-1 instances, with corresponding amnestic treatment administered as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-727 is a humanoid entity of undetermined genetic composition, approximately 1.7 meters in height and weighing approximately 30 kilograms. The subject's hair color has been reported as ranging from ginger to blond, with the skin coloration attributed to gray and yellow. Although SCP-727 appears to possess an aging abnormality similar to SCP-173's appearance, SCP-727 does not appear to be affected by aging processes relating to human physiology.</p><p>SCP-727-1 is a class D cognitohazard affecting humans who experience physical contact with SCP-727 in the presence of visual documentation of the encounter. An individual affected by this effect will become unable to recall information concerning the event(s) within three months of exposure to SCP-727, regardless of their current memories relating to this event. Subjects usually react violently when they find out they have forgotten these experiences and are capable of inflicting serious injury upon themselves at such an attempt. Eventually, subjects report feeling as if they were experiencing said events again; research has shown that subjects may or may not experience actual hallucinations consistent with their beliefs regarding SCP-727. Initial testing was conducted on former members of the Church of the Broken God, whose religious supernatural beliefs regarding SCP-273 aided in establishing appropriate test conditions for studying the effects of SCP-727 on subjects who had experienced it previously. These include:</p><p>Subjects who have already experienced SCP-727-1 will claim that this experience was merely fictitious fiction created by a friend or family member as part of a prank.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
