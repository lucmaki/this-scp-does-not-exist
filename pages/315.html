<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-315</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No official containment measure is at this time in effect for SCP-315. At least three Foundation agents are to monitor SCP-315's location at all times through various means.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-315 is a large, humanoid figure covered in black armor and wielding an enormous bludgeoning weapon. Despite the fact that there is no visible body beneath the armor, atmospheric analysis has shown the presence of oxygen. The armor is heavily dented and worn but undamaged.</p><p>SCP-315 will move towards any approaching human or animal with its giant hammer. Should SCP-315 strike a human or animal, it will retreat from the area to perform maintenance on its armor. Affected subjects will begin to feel as if they are being watched by an unseen presence until death occurs, after which SCP-315 will slowly walk back toward the subject's location to perform further maintenance on its armor. Any affected subject that makes contact with another living creature will be driven towards them, causing SCP-315 to continually walk toward the target.</p><p>If SCP-315 is unable to relocate any of its targets, it will wander aimlessly until it comes across another human or animal in need of a protector and proceed as before.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
