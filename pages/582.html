<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-582</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-582 is to be kept in a standard containment locker set at 4 degrees Celsius and 40% humidity. A personal air purifier is to be set up in the containment locker, and two (2) humidifiers are to be placed in the storage area containing SCP-582. The humidity level of the storage area has been significantly raised, in order to retain maximum moisture within the electronics.</p><p>The entire area housing SCP-582 is to be kept sterile and free for use by staff with Project Purity clearance. In the event that any bodily fluids leak into the storage area, these should be cleaned immediately and any affected electronics checked for damage. If possible, the electronic equipment is to be replaced immediately.</p><p>Any personnel exposed to SCP-582 are to undergo decontamination procedures before entering an area designated as “clean”.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-582 is an organ donor card, printed with the name “Adrianne Cunningham” as the card holder. The name “Adrianne Cunningham” was entered from data recovered from the deceased subject, who donated one of her organs to a not yet identified recipient at ██████ ████ Hospital.</p><p>Upon exposure to bodily fluids of an individual bearing genetic traits similar to those of the deceased subject, SCP-582 will display the genetic data and current blood type of this individual. However, the displayed blood type will be inconsistent with the blood type of the donor, leading to complications in procuring a suitable organ. As of now, it is unknown whether or not there is a correlation between the pattern of DNA in collisions and organ suitability.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
