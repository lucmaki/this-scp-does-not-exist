<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-671</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-671 is to be kept in a locked vault at Site 19. There is to be no access allowed with the exception of approved personnel and testing.</p><p>Any personnel that enter SCP-671 must wear a full face SCUBA mask at all times. Any personnel that leave SCP-671 must do so through the same entrance they entered. Any that exit SCP-671, whether by using an exit or not, are not to return to the site until SCP-671 has been checked for damages.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-671 appears to be a large spinning top made of concrete. When spun by hand, it will spin for approximately 30 seconds before slowing significantly and stopping. When spun by the power of a motor, SCP-671 has been shown to spin for 48 minutes with no break in its rotation. The top is 55 cm in diameter.</p><p>SCP-671 is capable of producing any mass of water within itself at a rate of 1.2 liters per minute, regardless of how much or how little water has been inside it previously. This water is not considered to be any form of liquid, as it is already 99% ice by the time it exits SCP-671. It has also been noted that the amount of water created increases in proportion to the amount of "spin" achieved by SCP-671.</p><p>When a living organism enters SCP-671, the top will begin to spin extremely fast, causing severe damage to the organism. The organism will then be expelled from SCP-671 once it is no longer spinning.</p><p>SCP-671 does not appear to have any effect on plants.</p><p>Testing logs:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
