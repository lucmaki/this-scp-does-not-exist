<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-989</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-989 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-989 is to be fed standard humanoid rations at specified intervals, and provided with recreation time as per standard practice for humanoid containment. SCP-989 is not to be allowed outside of the cell without permission from at least two Level 3 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-989 is an apparently human male of indeterminate age, standing at 1.6 meters in height and weighing 72 kilograms. It appears to be an ageless entity, however it will have signs of aging later in its life. SCP-989's skin tone is light brown and its hair is a dark brown color.</p><p>SCP-989 has several unusual abilities. It can manipulate both fire and water with great skill, being capable of producing and manipulating fire with a minimum of effort, as well as water to a lesser extent. It also has a unique ability to see through any material it is touching, allowing it to see through any object from which it is touching. This makes it difficult to hide items from SCP-989 because it can reach them through the cell bars without difficulty.</p><p>SCP-989 was discovered when an incident involving a fire occurred in downtown ████████████, Wyoming in 20██. The town was full of cowboys dressed in western attire, at least ██ of which were found to be instances of SCP-989. It was originally thought that this event were part of some kind of publicity stunt by [DATA EXPUNGED], but no such stunt has been documented or verified. When interviewed by Foundation agents, SCP-989 appeared to have no knowledge of its anomalous ability, claiming that he was born on ██/██/20██ in ████████, Wyoming to [REDACTED]. Further investigation revealed that SCP-989 had been wandering around the town at the time due to marital problems it had experienced with its wife. After the incident was contained, SCP-989's DNA was taken for future testing purposes.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
