<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-232</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-232 is to be contained in a steel case, lined with lead for added protection. Periodic cleaning will be required of the case; this includes inspection for any corrosion from the high pH levels of SCP-232. When not in use, SCP-232 should be stored in a secure location with its lid secured by a padlock.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-232 is a non-anomalous camera, of unknown age and manufacture. All elements are functional. The viewfinder displays a horizontal line stretching from the left to the right; the lens is capable of focusing on objects at any permanent distance. The shutter functions properly despite being bolted shut, and the film itself is unexposed.</p><p>The film inside SCP-232 is not a normal photographic film stock, but instead appears to be made of living tissue. The fleshy appearance of the film varies with each roll, but in every case possesses characteristics typical of human skin: elasticity, texture, and sensitivity to temperature changes, as well as its appearance changing upon exposure to visible light. Each roll also seems to produce an individual voice within the frame. A transcript follows:</p><p>Interrogation Transcript</p><p>[Begin Log]</p><p>Dr. █████: How long have you been sitting here?</p><p>SCP-232: We were coming back from… something… Remember? I’d like to eat now…</p><p>Dr. █████: You can’t do that here. I need answers. Sit up or I’ll sedate you again.</p><p>SCP-232: Oh! It was something we saw back when our parents first started taking us places. Didn’t you go see it last year?</p><p>Dr. █████: What was it?</p><p>SCP-232: It was a children’s show called… something… It was all made up! But it was so pretty! But there was this one artist who put powder on pictures so they would make sound! And then he ran away because his dad got pissed because he was making dendrites out of his house! Isn’t that funny? Dendrites! Dendrites everywhere! You should try it sometime! They sell them in all the vending machines in our town! They even write about them for us sometimes! You should try them sometime, yeah! That would be neat if we did that someday… eheh heh hhh…. Why are you looking at me like that? I didn’t do anything bad—Wait what’s happening here?</p><p>[End Log]</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
