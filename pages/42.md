<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-42</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All information related to SCP-42 is to be contained and locked within secure, restricted-access research databases. All data relating to SCP-42 is to be classified as Top Secret.</p><p>Any material related to SCP-42 that is not contained within research databases is considered SCiPTER (</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-42 is a phenomenon that has, since December of 2004, prevented the Foundation from successfully containing and neutralizing a Class I Keter-level SCP. The nature of this effect is currently unknown.</p><p>SCP-42 manifests as the following information.</p><p>Document 42-1: The Extinction Event Continues</p><p>It occurred so quickly. Three weeks after we arrived in Seattle, it was all over. We were working on a containment site in the Cascade Mountains when we got a call; a Class Grey was loose out west somewhere near Olympia. They said to get up there as fast as possible. I don't know if it was some new kind of virus or if it just infected them differently but it spread like wildfire through the entire city and it seemed that everyone had caught it. It was right outside our cabin; the quarantine measures we had installed there would have kept us safe but we didn't have time to do more than grab what clothes we could and run out into the woods.</p><p>We tried to fight it off but didn't stand a chance. I can still hear my partner screaming in pain as he died beside me, his head exploding in blood and brain matter next to my ear. That's when everything went dark for a moment and there was no more sound at all and then…</p><p>I don't know how long I floated out there after that but finally the world came back to me, slowly creeping back into focus like waking from a nightmare, and I looked around me at my two companions lying dead just yards away from me and half submerged in their own blood and bits of bone that were slowly floating down towards me. There was nothing else left alive anywhere around us; everyone else had done what they could and only seconds later none of them were able to move or speak anymore either.</p><p>I was alone now with this thing which was still growing behind me and spreading on the ground to meet us both; without any strength left we had no choice but to turn around and face it. As soon as we did it changed its shape, unfolded out of its cocooned form beneath the snow, expanded upwards, spread out its arms like wings, lifted itself off the ground… and flew away into the sky right above our heads.</p><p>I never saw where it went afterward because I didn't want to believe what I saw was real but suddenly there was another skull crushing down onto my face before everything went black again and when I came to again I didn't see anything but empty space surrounding myself forevermore.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
