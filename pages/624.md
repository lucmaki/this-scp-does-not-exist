<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-624</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-624 is to be contained within a standard containment cell at Site ██. The containment cell is to be continually monitored by security personnel, who are to keep within visual and verbal communication distance of the object at all times. No unauthorized personnel or vehicles are to enter the containment chamber for any reason.</p><p>As of Incident 624-B, all subjects affected by SCP-624 are to be kept indefinitely in Site-██'s Containment Wing. Subjects that experience further symptoms that may lead to a second incident are to be administered Class-A amnestics upon return to Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-624 is a large truck of unknown make and model, with the license plate "601 31EQ", located on the ██████-█████ highway in ██████, South Dakota. SCP-624 has been observed to have an anomalous effect on all people that view it.</p><p>All personnel affected by SCP-624 report symptoms that include feelings of fear, confusion, and disorientation. Subjects will be treated by medical staff with standard anti-anxiety medications and amnestics, which seem to work normally in the sense that they are not remembered. However, the negative effects of the medication and amnestics do not prevent or eliminate future manifestations of SCP-624's anomalous effects.</p><p>In most cases, subjects manifest their symptoms within two hours after viewing SCP-624. Furthermore, each instance will share identical symptoms with any other subject that views SCP-624 during its manifestation period. To date, no subject has reported experiencing a second manifestation while under treatment for the first instance.</p><p>Incident 624-B: On ██/██/20██, security camera footage displayed subjects entering Site-██'s Containment Wing for prolonged periods at a bizarre rate of one every three days. The incident was discovered after security personnel became suspicious of the unusually high number of personnel having entered the wing recently. When questioned about what they were doing inside the wing, several subjects reported feeling confused and fearful upon returning to their posts in response to a perceived threat. Suspicious actions taken by subjects throughout this period were noted by security personnel as suspect behavior and led to the discovery of the previously unreported effects and instances associated with SCP-624.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
