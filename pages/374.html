<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-374</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has established a web of fake dating sites, such as “The Dating Guide for 7-15 Year Olds” and “The Dating Service for 9-11 Year Olds”, designed to allow testing of SCP-374.</p><p>Any instances of SCP-374-1 currently within the scope of Foundation control are to be secured and frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-374 is an anomalous memetic phenomenon affecting individuals of either gender between the ages of 1 and 72.</p><p>SCP-374-1 are organisms (referred to as SCP-374-1 instances) capable of expressing both romantic and sexual desire towards any entity capable of meeting their needs. The majority of SCP-374-1 instances have no qualms about discussing or going through with such a relationship, and show a lack of regard for the age difference. Like all other SCP objects, SCP-374-1 instances are referred to by designations: SCP-374-1/A (adult female), SCP-374-1/B (adult male), SCP-374-1/C (child), and so on, with “?” denoting an unknown instance of SCP biology.</p><p>Nonessential organs (such as the heart and liver) are unaffected by SCP-374; however, any organ affected by the memetic effect will begin to regenerate at anomalously high rates. Organ regeneration does not occur in the presence of sapient lifeforms in healthy states until several months have passed. If necessary, this can be further accelerated by amplifying the memetic effect by use of somatic amnestics.</p><p>The brain remains unaffected unless the organism's condition attains a score of 68 or higher on the Safety Stockpile's Surgery Scale. Once this point has been reached, the still intact parts of an organism's brain begin to enter into an altered state that mimics death while simultaneously producing amnestics. This process has been shown to be more suitable than the more traumatic methods often used in human experimentation due to the ease with which it can be performed without permanent damage; should it be completed without death occurring, the subject is designated SCP-374/434a2.</p><p>Organ regeneration ceases one month after death occurs, at which point any organs removed during this process may be reattached and eventually remain functional.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
