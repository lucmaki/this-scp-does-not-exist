<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-871</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-871 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with the door secured and locked. SCP-871 may be removed by Site-77 personnel upon request, but is otherwise not to be handled by unauthorized personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-871 is a pair of sunglasses fashioned out of plastic, with the identifying label "FOUND IN HILLARY'S BEDROOM, NEW YORK". The lenses are heavily scratched and bent out of shape, the frame itself appears to have been repaired several times. When worn, SCP-871 displays a compulsion to corrupt Foundation personnel who view it.</p><p>SCP-871 will attempt to corrupt any individual who views it as soon as they remove it and put it on. After approximately 15 minutes, SCP-871 will manifest an urge to break into Foundation facilities and steal any valuables, especially if those items belong to SCP objects. Despite this, SCP-871 will flee from Foundation security personnel instead of actively attacking them. SCP-871 has shown no sign of ability to speak; however, there are indications that whatever "speaking" mechanisms SCP-871 possesses are at work.</p><p>As well as its behavior, SCP-871's effects do not extend to off-site personnel or Site-77 staff. It is currently unknown how SCP-871 acquires information regarding Foundation facilities and personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
