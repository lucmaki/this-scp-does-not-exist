<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-939</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-939 is currently kept in a standard containment unit at Site-13. The object is to be kept in a separate section of the containment unit, where it may be observed for up to one hour every week. During this time, personnel responsible for SCP-939 are to remain within 50cm of the object at all times.</p><p>At no time should the object be moved or allowed to leave its containment area in any form. A small webcam is required near the subject's food and water, as the subject will attempt to feed on the camera when given the opportunity.</p><p>For information on amnesticizing and dosing SCP-939, please see Addendum 939-1</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-939 is an anthropomorphic cat, approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 16.5 kilograms. The creature is composed entirely of living tissue, and appears to be missing several portions of its limbs. SCP-939 often attempts to feed on any nearby humans; this behavior causes a strong compulsion to the individual involved, and will result in them returning to SCP-939's containment area on their own accord.</p><p>When forced to remain within its containment unit, SCP-939 will attempt to groom itself until it develops several dozen fully formed and articulated legs that appear identical to its original limbs. SCP-939 will then proceed to walk upright at a normal human walking pace. The most notable difference between SCP-939 and a normal cat, is that the subject will speak with a nasality and an English accent typical of English people from the middle-ages.</p><p>SCP-939's anomalous effects do not appear unless it is fed by an intelligent being; if allowed to starve, it will revert into its original amorphous state. The subject has been shown to revert into this state regardless of whether the experimenter is capable of feeding themselves or not.</p><p>SCP-939 was first discovered in ████████, England after reports surfaced of a small humanoid creature wandering around the town at night. An investigation team consisting of agents from MTF Psi-7 (The Empaths) captured SCP-939 without incident before transporting it back to Site-13 as per standard procedure.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
