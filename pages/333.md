<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-333</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-333 is to be kept in a standard cell of a Type 2 Secure Containment Unit at Site 51. SCP-333 is to be fed once every 24 hours and shall require no other treatment. In the event of an emergency, SCP-333 is allowed limited access to one personnel for up to 10 minutes at a time, with no more than one additional personnel present. At the end of this time, SCP-333 is to receive no further outside contact until an additional five (5) minutes have passed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-333 is an adult male indetectable humanoid entity of an unknown biological classification. SCP-333's physical description and appearance appear to be related to SCP-███, a human entity thought to have been created as a result of the SCP-███ Experiment. SCP-333 has not volunteered any information regarding its origin or nature, and has not shown demonstrated any knowledge of its anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-333 describes itself as "a science experiment" which was mistakenly installed into its current containment cell. It identifies itself by these circumstances only; it will use first and last names when speaking with personnel, but does not respond to questions about the nature of its origin.</p><p>When under direct observation via CCTV for one half hour per week, SCP-333 will exhibit one of three states:</p><p>Foundation personnel who interact with SCP-333 report similar effects, although this effect is much weaker than when directly observing SCP-333. Each additional Foundation personnel present during observation can reduce the strength of this effect.</p><p>SCP-333's main motivation appears to revolve around learning more about its anomalous properties. It will often engage in "what do you know?" conversations with Foundation personnel; questions that produce positive reactions include "why don't we know more about it?", "is there a way to tell it apart from other anomalies?", and "is there a way to make it talk?". These topics are also frequently discussed with non-Foundation personnel, who generally have little success in answering these questions. When confronted with these topics during conversation with Foundation personnel, SCP-333 will openly express disappointment at its lack of knowledge, claiming that it "hates secrets".</p><p>The researcher writing the log entry must attempt to answer the questions posed by SCP-333 in order to avoid further negative effects on his/her mental state. Failure to do so will result in increased levels of isolation until a successful log entry is written down.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
