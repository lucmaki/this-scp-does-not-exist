<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-151</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-151 instances are kept in secured, soundproofed tanks measuring approximately 44 m (144 ft) length and 21 m (70 ft) width. Three to five instances are kept per tank. One tank is located in Site-19, two in Area-12, and one in Sector-13. Multiple tanks on a single site are arranged to avoid a single point of failure.</p><p>Instances have been observed to carry with them spare or replacement parts for their traps, but only those which cannot be replaced by the club members themselves. Should a non-anomalous portion of the articles be damaged or destroyed, the club will simply find another member with the same part and continue production.</p><p>Individuals involved in the club are to be assigned high security financial penalties for all criminal offenses they commit while participating in SCP-151.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-151 is an anomalous criminal organization known as "The Rhino Hunters". It is believed to be a loose confederation of members who hunt and trap rhinos for their horns. Foundation agents have attempted to infiltrate the group, but members have consistently identified them as non-anomalous individuals.</p><p>Their methodologies consist of building crudely constructed wooden traps, with barbets and hooks for the rhinos. These traps have been observed to include no discernable means of power or communication, instead relying on simple human strength to hold down their targets. Instances use the horns of rhinos as handles or levers to move or lift objects.</p><p>Any human attempting to move a rhino from the club's charge into another location is either killed or severely injured while being moved. The club itself takes no part in this process, instead gathering trophies and parts from the carcasses of the deceased rhinos. Should an instance be killed in action, its corpse is stripped and put into storage until it can be brought back to life by a member of the club.</p><p>Club members are extremely reluctant to discuss anything directly connected with SCP-151, and will instead divert attention away from themselves and towards possible methods of neutralizing or destroying the organization.</p><p>Due to the nature of SCP-151, members will not develop any sort of plan based on skill sets outside those required for trap construction and lifting operations. As such, there are currently no plans in place for capturing or subduing instances during containment breaches - only for preventing one from occurring, or for terminating all instances at once through a single successful capture or termination.</p><p>A day before Incident 151-A occurred, representatives from Site-19, Area-12 and Sector-13 staff arrived within each other's bounds to partake in a "relay race" involving SCP-151 traps set up across three sites. The internal security forces (SIC) of each site were notified that any personnel seen tampering with these traps would be punished immediately; this act was successful in preventing any reports of abnormalities appearing on their radarscopes during the race.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
