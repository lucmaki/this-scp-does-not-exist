<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-898</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-898 is to be contained in an area of at least 20km2 that is completely devoid of any form of wireless connectivity. SCP-898 is to be housed in a soundproof chamber that is secured with two electrified doors, one at the entrance and one at the exit. Access to SCP-898 must be gained only after successful testing has been completed by multiple (preferably 3) test subjects. The interior of SCP-898's containment chamber is to be furnished with a chair, table and computer terminal. At no time are more than three individuals allowed within SCP-898's containment chamber at a time.</p><p>All personnel entering or leaving the room must wear anti-electromagnetic pulse devices that are capable of withstanding a Class 5 electromagnetic pulse.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-898 is a portable antivirus program developed on ██████ ████ Network Corporation's ███ ████ "Smart" Laptop PC, model 14S096-2. SCP-898 has the ability to detect and remove viruses from all types of computing devices connected to its onboard satellite. The anomaly was discovered when several users reported that their laptops were unaffected by known viruses, despite being infected with a high number of threats. The data contained within SCP-898 matches no other computer or network in existence, thus leading to the assumption that the virus had been intentionally created by SCP-898.</p><p>SCP-898 appears as an ordinary laptop PC, but is equipped with multiple subdermal nodes located throughout the user's body. These nodes are capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation from any source it comes in contact with, including computers, cellular phones and other electronics. Upon seizing this energy, SCP-898 changes form into a humanoid shape that resembles its original manufacturer; ██████ ████ Network Corporation.</p><p>When power is removed from SCP-898, it loses its sentience and becomes inert once more until power is again applied to it. It should be noted that this process can only occur if not in human proximity or if prevented by the use of anti-electromagnetic pulse devices. Attempts at removing this power have proven fruitless; thus far they have failed due to the lack of support circuitry required to achieve this task: however, ongoing testing may alter this outcome.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
