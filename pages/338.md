<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-338</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> nan</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-338 is to be kept in a secure cell until it manifests.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-338 appears as a human female of approximately 1.8m (5 ft 11.6in) in height. The subject's skin is a uniform deep brown colour, which changes to light brown when exposed to sunlight. SCP-338 possesses two breasts, each measuring at 50cm (19.7in) in circumference and weighing between 2kg (4.4bw) and 3kg (6.8bw) respectively, giving it a body mass index (BMI) of 27-29. One of its eyes is black and the other is blue; that eye is covered by an eyepatch due to a minor case of traumatic retinal detachment. SCP-338 does not appear to have any other visible bodily orifice aside from the eyes, mouth and ears, although it may still be able to eat and hear sounds through otherwise inaccessible areas of its body.</p><p>SCP-338 is normally kept in a small white cell measuring 4m (13.1ft) by 4m (13.1ft), with no access to windows or sunlight. It will attempt to escape its cell at irregular intervals, with one escape attempt in 28 days recorded so far. When released SCP-338 can move along the ground at speeds exceeding 50km/h (31mph), although this speed gradually slows over time unless provided with sustained exercise. Attempting to cause injury to SCP-334 results in marks identical to those left on skin by an animal's claws or teeth being drawn upon the subject's body, although these wounds are invariably healed within 24 hours after being made.</p><p>SCP-338 has demonstrated an unusual ability to understand the speech of others regardless of their capacity for speech or understanding language. This effect is thought to be caused by its highly advanced sensory system allowing it to detect patterns in human vocal emissions and transmitting them directly into the brain of another person regardless of language barrier or comprehension capabilities; however, this has only been proven on Foundation personnel so far.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
