<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-814</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Five members of the Site-47 security detail are to be present at all times in SCP-814's containment chamber, equipped with white lab coats and safety goggles. Containment chambers for SCP-814 are to be lit with red lighting at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-814 is a pair of white, hand-made pajamas composed of an unknown fabric. The undergarments and outer garment appear to be made from a similar fabric, with the exception of a red trim around the sleeves and waistline. SCP-814 reveals no anomalous properties while worn.</p><p>When not worn by an instance of SCP-814-1, it will animate and spontaneously generate into its anomalous state: a humanoid form composed entirely of other pajamas up to three meters in length. All instances of SCP-814-1 are dressed in identical colored pajamas, usually reading "SCP" on the left breast.</p><p>In this form, SCP-814 will attempt to enter sleeping or living quarters occupied by an unaware human population. The instance will introduce itself with some variation on the following dialogue:</p><p>My name is XXXX. I am your hero!</p><p>I have come here to save you from your fear and despair! Just don't be afraid, as you are one with me now!</p><p>I'll fight for you… I'll fight for us! We can make it through this together!</p><p>SCP-814 then attempts to enter the subject's bed and begins performing a type of dance unique to each individual. It will typically continue dancing for 5 minutes before moving onto another portion of the subject's bedroom. Eventually, it will begin passing out printed brochures in place of having physical contact with its subject. When SCP-814 acts as this manner in a building containing more than ten individuals at once, it will travel to other building complexes or engage in its spontaneous dance until it must leave.</p><p>When attempting to enter a subject's residence during their sleep cycle, SCP-814 will cause one or more nervous system disorders (neurosis) that forces the subject to move out of their residence. This effect occurs in only one case out of every 10 subjects tested under controlled conditions, with most subjects being lucid during the event.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
