<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-985</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe (restricted access</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-985 is kept at Site-22's Safe SCP wing, where it is to be stored in a standard storage locker. Testing of SCP-985 requires the approval of at least one Level 3 security clearance. SCP-985 must be kept as far away from other items as possible to prevent accidental activation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-985 is a 4.5 cm x 5 cm x 0.5 cm piece of tooth (Fossorium incisum) with a simplistic design and no markings. Despite its small size, it functions as a fully functional toothbrush, albeit one which requires the user to apply some force in order to brush effectively.</p><p>When a human subject brushes their teeth with SCP-985, they will report feeling a sensation similar to that of brushing their teeth with an antiseptic dental floss product. They will also report the impression of a white, angular surface beneath the subject's tongue. The subject will also report that they feel sharp pains, similar to those felt by manual extraction or dental implants.</p><p>If an individual brushes their teeth with SCP-985 while they are under the influence of substances such as alcohol or sedatives, they will experience no effect; however, if they brush their teeth while sober, they will claim that they feel as though their teeth have been "cleaned".</p><p>While it has not been possible to determine whether or not SCP-985 is an actual part of the human body, it does appear to be "naturally" formed from one individual's tooth at some point in time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
