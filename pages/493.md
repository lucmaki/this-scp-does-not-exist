<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-493</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the clandestine nature of this anomaly, no special procedures are required.</p><p>Instances of SCP-493 are kept in small waterproof boxes, locked in a small storage area located on site 44a. Foundation security personnel are to monitor all doors to the storage area at all times, and they are to be changed every 24 hours. Only a select number of personnel are allowed on site 44a at any given time, and are only to have access to non-classified documents. Any violation of this rule is to result in immediate termination and disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-493 is a collection of books, pamphlets and magazines dating from the 6th century to the present. All items have been found in Catholic cathedrals, monasteries and libraries around Europe, and have been cataloged under various titles such as La Fide Catholica, Notre-Dame de Louvain, or Il Catecumenale di Ratisbona. Each item has an identical cover, containing only a crude illustration of an object consistent with Catholic doctrine.</p><p>No two individuals have been found to possess all of the items at the same time, although it is clear that there were at least two groups of individuals involved in the creation of the items, and that one group was unaware that an antagonist sought to spread anti-Catholic propaganda.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
