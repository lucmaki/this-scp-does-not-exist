<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-903</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-903 is to be contained in a large containment unit located on the grounds of Site-62. Due to its size, SCP-903 is kept on a small area of land situated off the main campus. The cost of maintenance of this area has been estimated at approximately $15 per day, or approximately $60 per month. This cost increases to $80 per month when feeding takes place.</p><p>The surrounding area is fenced off and patrolled by security personnel at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-903 is a species of large grass commonly known as "twenty-five o'clock" grass. The grass appears to be a genetically modified version of the common garden variety, having been bred for its size and strength. When SCP-903 is agitated or alarmed, it extends telescopically along the ground to approximately 25 meters in length. At this point, SCP-903 becomes a plant-like entity, capable of moving throughout the facility at speeds of up to 30 km/h with ease. SCP-903 will attempt to explore any new area it's placed in, only stopping when it finds itself unable to move farther. Once SCP-903 has traveled far enough, it reverts back into a regular grass and grows over itself.</p><p>SCP-903 takes on a humanoid appearance if it brushes against an individual's leg or arm. Those who come into contact with SCP-903 report feeling an almost electrical sensation as they make contact; this sensation only occurs while they're still within 50 meters of SCP-903 and lasts roughly five seconds (with the exception of Long John Silvers).</p><p>The anomalous properties of SCP-903 become active once it is within approximately 300 meters of another human being; thus, care should be taken when observing or handling SCP-903.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
