<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-145</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-145 is to be kept in a standard Safe object locker. SCP-145's anomalous effect lasts for seven days after exposure. Exposed subjects are to be monitored daily for any signs of increasing their numbers, and taken into Foundation custody immediately upon discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-145 is a biological specimen, composed of [REDACTED] and an unidentified organic compound. Upon exposure to air, SCP-145 begins to rapidly decompose and self-destruct, breaking down into a fine powder. This happens at a rate of 25% per twenty-four hours until the specimen is fully decomposed.</p><p>This effect will cease if the subject is placed in potentially hazardous areas such as high explosives or radioactive materials. These limits are to be enforced upon the subject by D-class personnel working in tandem with Foundation Object Containment teams.</p><p>During testing, subjects have been known to survive the process of decomposition for several weeks, retaining their original shape and appearance. However, survival beyond that point has proven inefficient; subjects will begin to lose themselves when they lose track of time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
