<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-436</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-436 is to be kept in a standard containment locker in Site-77's Safe SCP wing. Standard Foundation issue Class 3A gloves and a mask are required for any testing or handling of SCP-436; only personnel with prior experience with contagious diseases may handle the object.</p><p>Personnel suspected of carrying the disease are to be quarantined for 28 days immediately upon exhibiting symptoms of SCP-436.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-436 is a leather-bound book with approximately 150 pages in size; all pages are written in a futhark runic alphabet. The book's binding, made of a mixture of animal hide and metal, is believed to be from the area around ████, Italy.</p><p>The book's contents are not understood by any known language or code. The only word legible on the first page is "Shoot", next to an illustration of what appears to be a firearm (designated SCP-436-1). All text carved into the rest of the book is impossible to make out without special visors and/or ultraviolet light.</p><p>SCP-436's anomalous effect occurs when two people standing within 10 meters of one another read from or even handle the book in any way. The infected will then begin to act as if they have contracted a contagious disease, becoming violent, irritable, and paranoid. Unless given amnestic treatment, they will attempt to spread the disease to others through bodily contact or verbal communication.</p><p>The symptoms of SCP-436's infection include:</p><p>Cases of SCP-436 infection appear to be more common in areas where firearms are dominant (such as rural areas). Infected persons will initially deny having read or handled SCP-436; however, upon being questioned by Foundation personnel, they will answer truthfully. When questioned further about the source of their infection, they will state that "God gave it to me".</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
