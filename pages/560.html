<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-560</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-560 is to be contained within a large containment area at the ████████'s base. SCP-560 requires an individual that is biologically capable of sustained contact with air, preferably without their own air supply. The entrance to this area is to be barred by automated security systems, and access to the area itself is strictly prohibited. A system of airlocks have also been constructed around the outside of the containment area, with each one having a separate airlock to prevent SCP-560 from breaching containment.</p><p>Two persons are to be stationed within the containment area at all times, both of which must have no history of being exposed to SCPs before. All testing is to be approved by Dr. █████ prior to implementation. All personnel are to wear fully sealed HAZMAT suits while in the proximity of SCP-560 unless given clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-560 is a custom-built submarine that is 1.9 meters long and 56 kilograms in weight. No external markings have been found on SCP-560, although markings appear on the interior of the sub, indicating that it was built by a group known as "Underwater Technology Laboratory" (UNT Lab). The hull of the boat appears similar to an early era US Navy submarine, with a single torpedo storage tube on the rear of the craft and numerous holes, presumably for remote rerouting of air and/or water.</p><p>SCP-560 can generate a large amount of negative pressure within its outer casing; this pressure is able to displace any non-anomalous matter within a 50 meter radius of the craft. This inner containment area is filled with compressed air at approximately 15 kPa abs, which will continue pushing outwards forever unless the air within it is replaced or vented. A thin layer of lead paint and silicone sealant has been applied to prevent any leaks through the sub's hull.</p><p>When an individual enters SCP-560 for testing purposes for the first time, they will be surrounded by air and crewed by D-Class personnel which are embedded into the hull of SCP-560, becoming one with it after approximately 14 minutes of exposure to the vacuum. The aforementioned sealed suits protect against decompression sickness as well as allowing for space travel without exposing the wearer to vacuum; however, all suits remove oxygen from the body and therefore do not require an air supply once they are sealed. The location where these persons are located seems random; they have repeatedly been observed being located in different parts of the sub's interior, including among internal pipes that connect compartments throughout the craft.</p><p>The individuals inside SCP-560's interior will be unable to move from their position and will begin experiencing severe pain due to lack of O². The cause of this pain is unknown but likely relates to nitrogen narcosis, which causes disorientation and vomiting when exposed to high levels of O² for too long; additionally, there are instances where subjects who have spent extended amounts of time sealed away have become catatonic due to lack of O², having experienced severe hallucinations concerning their surrounding environment and feelings of extreme discomfort.</p><p>The only way out of SCP-560 is if an outside force such as a diving bell can thrust itself into its outer hull while fully submerged in order to plug up any leaks or breaches in its hull caused by decompression or damage.</p><p>Testing on sentient beings has proven effective at replicating conditions inside SCP-560, although these individuals require prolonged periods of exposure before actually being subject to a complete simulation; currently this is planned using D class personnel until further testing can be completed using volunteers residing at Site ██'s medical facility.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
