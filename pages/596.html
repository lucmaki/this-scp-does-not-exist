<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-596</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-596 is to be kept in a reinforced cell measuring 1m x 1m x 1m. The walls and floor of this cell are to be made of obsidian, and the ceiling is to be lined with lead. The interior of SCP-596's cell must be kept dimly lit at all times. As SCP-596 requires twenty (20) watts of continuous illumination, no more than ten (10) watts are allowed to be used directly outside its cell.</p><p>Recovered instances of SCP-596-1 are kept in an airtight storage locker located inside Site-55's Containment Wing, Sector-55.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-596 is a pale, human female of average build who claims to be approximately 50 years old. The individual's hair and body age appear to be in accord with SCP-596's stated age, but it is highly unlikely that this human matches SCP-596's physical appearance at any point prior to the activity of its anomalous effect.</p><p>SCP-596 does not sleep or eat, instead remaining awake for approximately ten (10) hours a day. During this time, SCP-596 typically sits in a different location each day of the week, seemingly at random. The location varies from day to night and from month to month, but it has been observed to be associated with locations notable for political events or titles of importance (for example, the United States Capitol Building, the British Houses of Parliament, and the Imperial Palace in Tokyo). SCP-596 appears to spend this time carefully observing events taking place around it; observers report that it seems intent on memorizing notable details about these events, including specific speeches made by prominent figures and slogans written on placards carried by demonstrators. At the end of each session, SCP-596 stands up and walks away without making any further movement - although this behavior is somewhat more consistent when not under observation by eyewitnesses.</p><p>SCP-596 has demonstrated no ability to communicate verbally or otherwise following its exposure as an anomalous object. It also refuses to allow itself to be physically manipulated or moved through any means short of direct physical force devices. Although it possesses some knowledge regarding simple mathematics, its speech can become confused if subjects are discussed beyond a basic level of comprehension.</p><p>The earliest known instance of SCP-596-1 was recorded during a protest march held in Toronto on 12 November 1995 as an act of protest against Canada's decision to eliminate section 43(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). The protester present was seen wearing a badge indicating support for the CHRA which bore the text: "Don't make fun of my flag!" As SCP-596 walked past this protester at 10PM local time, it ceased walking immediately and remained still for three minutes. SCP-596 then proceeded calmly towards a nearby building where it remains at this date.</p><p>Since its initial containment, five (5) additional instances of SCP-596-1 have been recovered; all recovered instances date from between 1995 and 2001 and were created using flags used during these dates by various governmental entities around the world.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
