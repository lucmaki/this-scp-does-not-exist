<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-952</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-952 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-952 is to be kept alive and well fed at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-952 is a humanoid of unknown origins, physically resembling a male human with sandy brown hair, a beard, and hazel eyes. SCP-952's skin has a slight greenish tint to it, as well as a few scars on its left cheek. When not under direct observation, SCP-952 will usually wear loose fitting robes or clothing that obscures most of its body.</p><p>When SCP-952 speaks, it will usually do so in multiple languages. In addition to English and Russian, SCP-952 will often talk in Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese. These languages are all known to be spoken by SCP-952's species. SCP-952 will also make use of other languages when speaking to humans that are not native speakers of any language.</p><p>SCP-952 was discovered after an incident involving the destruction of a large portion of Yokohama, Japan. The Foundation's Office of Paranormal Research and Defense was contacted after reports surfaced of "ghosts" causing destruction across the city. The investigation concluded that several witnesses had been infected with SCP-952 while entering one of the destroyed areas.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
