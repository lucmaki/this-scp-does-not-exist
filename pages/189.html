<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-189</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-189 is to be stored in a standard Safe-class item locker. No personnel are permitted access to SCP-189 without Level 5 clearance, except testing purposes. When necessary to test the effect of SCP-189 on humans, either D-Class personnel or a human subject with no memory of prior exposure is required.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-189 is a standard 2.5 mm hardback diary. It reads "Houston, Texas." The cover itself appears to be of silk and contains no distinguishing marks aside from the title of the book itself.</p><p>When a human subject with no memory of prior exposure to SCP-189 attempts to write in it, they will experience a sensation akin to diarritm. This ranges from mild discomfort (as if shuffling) to severe pain (as if being kicked), depending on the amount of ink used. The degree of discomfort inflicted by SCP-189 may be reduced by allowing the affected person to rest for a period of time.</p><p>The more ink consumed, the louder the effect will be. A single sheet of paper will cease being heard when approximately 10 sheets are consumed, and increase in volume until approximately 200 sheets have been consumed. SCP-189 has never produced this volume without at least one full page remaining. If a journal or diary is not completed within five days after writing begins, the volume decreases until it ceases upon completion, except for very long journals (such as those created using SCP-189).</p><p>SCP-189 was discovered on ██/██/19██ when Foundation Agents ██████ and █████ discovered a body on █████ Street in Houston, Texas bearing a fatal wound consistent with an object being thrown at him. The victim had been identified as Ramesh Bhatnagar, a former ████ resident living in Houston since ████. The stroke that killed him was caused by a sharp object piercing his left eye socket and piercing his brain stem; however, he suffered several smaller wounds to his face and hands consistent with blunt trauma. Mr. Bhatnagar was confirmed dead at the scene. The cause of death was ruled due to cardiac arrest brought on by blood loss; poison cardiac arrest cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
