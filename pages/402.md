<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-402</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-402 is to be contained in a Containment Vault at Site-19. During testing, SCP-402 is to be restrained in an Iso-Perch harness and held on the subject's left hand. Under no circumstances is any object less than 4 cm tall to be brought into direct contact with SCP-402.</p><p>Unwanted subjects who accidentally come in contact with SCP-402 are to be sheltered until medical assistance arrives. Any human exposed to SCP-402 may not be regained without first being decontaminated and amnesticized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-402 is a male yellow-green parrot (Amazonetta plumbea) weighing approximately 1.5 kg. SCP-402 is capable of vocalization in at least five languages, but primarily speaks English. Though initially believed to be a member of the genus Amazona, testing has shown that SCP-402 cannot speak in any species other than Amazona, possibly due to brain trauma sustained during its containment.</p><p>When in the presence of an individual who believes that it is "raining", SCP-402 will vocalize differently than it normally would, instead imitating the sound of raindrops striking surfaces (SCP-403). The severity and duration of this effect varies from test subject to test subject; subjects reporting different sensations from normal rain include:</p><p>Contact with SCP-402 or any object bearing its likeness, regardless of size, will result in the affected subject developing severe anxiety, accompanied by severe physical ailments such as:</p><p>SCP-402's containment chamber bears a plaque bearing the text "The One Who Knows" with an image of SCP-402 beneath it, along with several other plaques bearing various phrases and images relating to anomalous entities and religions.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
