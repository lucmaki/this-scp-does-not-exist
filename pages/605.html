<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-605</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-605 is contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. To prevent SCP-605 from spreading, it is to be fed a diet consisting primarily of organic matter. Each feeding session lasts for no more than twenty minutes and is supervised by on-site personnel. Only researchers with Level 3 clearance may feed SCP-605.</p><p>In the event that SCP-605 escapes, all humans and animals within a radius of one hundred kilometers are to be shot on sight. SCP-605 must not be killed; the sample should instead be kept alive indefinitely in order to study its behavior and physiology.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-605 is a humanoid of indeterminate age and sex. It stands 1.7 meters (5 feet, 4 inches) tall, weighs 78 kilograms (170 pounds) and has a body mass index in the mid-forties. SCP-605's skin is covered in small, red bumps that grow in size over time. SCP-605 will occasionally attempt to cover its face with these bumps, but it stops working on this when it feels like it needs to consume something. SCP-605 is also able to produce saliva through these pores, which it uses to swallow water and objects of up to 0.4 grams.</p><p>SCP-605's diet consists primarily of grasses, trees and other types of plants, although it does not seem to discriminate against edible material. Its preferred method of consumption involves grabbing the nearest object and consuming it as quickly as possible. This method of feeding causes SCP-605 to lose all of its bodily fluids in a matter of seconds; loss of fluids causes SCP-605 to lose consciousness until enough have been restored by drinking water.</p><p>SCP-605 is capable of controlling plant growth for up to three hours at a time, when it is sleeping or eating, though this does not appear to be a conscious act on the part of SCP-605. The native species of plants affected by SCP-605's telekinesis are largely unknown; however, some plants have been noted growing closer together than they naturally would have been due to SCP-605 using this power against them. It has also been found that gases emitted by plants can be used by SCP-605 as part of its food source, causing plants such as palm trees and bamboo to release steam even when they aren't being touched.</p><p>SCP-605 was first discovered after reports were sent in by local military personnel in New Zealand. The subject was found within a mountainous region at the base of a large mountain range, attempting to eat vegetation which had grown to unusually large sizes because of the dryness over the past two years. Initial attempts at containment failed because SCP-605 was able to escape the containment cell before any sedatives could be administered, though damage was minimal and none of the subjects were actually harmed during the attempted escape; however, escape attempts were not permitted for several days afterward and no further attempts have yet been made at containment.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
