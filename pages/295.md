<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-295</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-295 is to be housed in a standard containment chamber with all facilities, personnel and equipment at Site-██. This chamber is to be fitted with a motion detector to prevent the manifestation of SCP-295. A large keter containment cell is to be constructed around the perimeter of the chamber for additional security measures. All personnel entering SCP-295's containment chamber must wear full-body protective suits. Approved personnel only; see addendum below.</p><p>All personnel entering SCP-295's containment chamber are required to conduct a written survey on their experience prior to entering the room. Failure to complete the survey will result in immediate termination. Any surviving members of the assigned personnel will be given amnestics and given a replacement position if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-295 (Mimeograph Copying Machine) is a 4m tall, black device recessed into the wall of SCP-295's containment chamber. SCP-295 will seemingly vanish into the wall, only to reappear elsewhere in the same room. It does not possess any components typically found on standard equipment for mimeograph machines, such as ink or paper.</p><p>SCP-295 appears to have four "targets" or "objectives" which it will attempt to complete during its manifestation; these objectives are dependent on the current operational state of SCP-295. This operational state can be determined by the position of a red light located at the bottom of SCP-295. The following are each of SCP-295's operational states:</p><p>Each objective requires either special tools or tools that could not be obtained anywhere on Earth, including items that were created in other universes. In 26% of tests, a separate item is required to complete the objective; these items can be found anywhere on Earth, even if they were not manufactured here.</p><p>Approval Required To Enter: Only approved personnel are allowed access to SCP-295; see addendum below for details. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to enter SCP-295's containment chamber will be terminated upon arrival.</p><p>A complete list of all personnel who have been approved and have entered SCP-295's containment chamber may be found here</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
