<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-893</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation's primary task is to prevent the public at large from learning of SCP-893. A large public library and a small academic library are to be built in rural Norfolk, England, with SCP-893 actively suppressed by disinformation campaigns and lack of interest.</p><p>All copies of "A Dictionary for the Non-Existant" are to be withdrawn from print and destroyed. In addition, all members of the public who have purchased this book are to be detained as possible carriers of an SCP-893 infection, and placed under quarantine for their own protection.</p><p>An automated biometric identification system has been set up at the site where SCP-893 was first discovered; any person attempting to enter or leave that site without proper biometric identification will be apprehended and immediately delivered to the nearest Foundation medical facility for testing. Any individual claiming to be immune to SCP-893 is regarded as a possible carrier of SCP-893, and is detained on suspicion until proven otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-893 is a physical book, whose front cover and back cover display the titles "Dictionary for the Non-Exicient" and "A Dictionary for the Non-Existant," respectively. The first and last pages of the book contain no text.</p><p>The remainder of the book displays two pages of text. The first page contains a preface by "The editors of A Dictionary For The Non-Existant" which encourages the reader to learn more about what they are reading. The second page displays approximately 500 words and phrases in ten columns under the title "The Meaning". SCP-893 infects any living human who touches, reads, or attempts to copy more than twenty pages; however, infection causes no adverse effects other than a mild confusion effect on the infected person. Infection does not cross between different copies of SCP-893.</p><p>Any human who looks up one of these words at least once becomes an instance of SCP-893-1. Instances of SCP-893-1 vary from extremely simple organic life forms (such as amoebas) to extremely complicated inorganic life (such as a silicon life form). Where possible, they are created in environments that would be expected to have similar environmental conditions to their original environment, even if the location is entirely alien to the subject's own experience.</p><p>When an instance of SCP-893-1 attempts to leave its location, it will attempt to recreate a copy of itself that has identical properties to itself. This is performed by creating several copies of the same basic being (see Addendum 893.1), then using them as templates to make further copies until they have all been created with identical properties. However, as there is usually no source material for this process, most instances of SCP-893 reactivate when their resources are exhausted or their environment is destroyed, leaving their creations' existence unknown.</p><p>SCP-893 was discovered on 22 May 1995, when several reports were filed by people claiming that anomalous beings were appearing in houses throughout Norfolk during June 1995. These reports were investigated by Foundation personnel who subsequently implanted a device into the wall of one room inside each subject's house. Testing established that only those individuals who had seen SCP-893 were affected by it; people unaffected by it became curious about it and could not understand why it made people upset.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
