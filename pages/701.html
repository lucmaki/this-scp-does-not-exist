<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-701</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-701 is to be kept in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell. Attending personnel are to monitor SCP-701 for signs of aggression. SCP-701 has been fitted with an electronic monitoring device of the type commonly used for electronic surveillance, to be accessed by Level 2 security personnel should the need arise.</p><p>Any personnel assigned to SCP-701's containment are forbidden from speaking with any person who does not meet the following criteria:</p><p>There is no evidence that SCP-701 is aware of the above or has ever been aware of it. Further testing is pending approval from research division administration.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-701 appears to be a middle aged Caucasian male with a height of 2.3m and weight of 55kg. SCP-701's eyes are described as being of "average size", and feature no discernible coloration. SCP-701 has been observed making facial expressions, but does not possess musculature capable of producing speech. It is theorized that SCP-701 uses its ability for limited manipulation of conventional technology to convey its thoughts when verbal communication is not possible or desired.</p><p>SCP-701 seems to have a degree of intelligence sufficient to learn human interactions, although it exhibited little interest in anything but itself while in Foundation custody. SCP-701 exhibits an awareness of its surroundings and an extraordinary capacity for learning new languages, but displays difficulty understanding written language.</p><p>SCP-701 is able to alter its physical appearance at will, altering its skin tone, eye color, and even body shape via skin grafts (see Incident 701-T). The method by which these alterations are effected is as yet unknown.</p><p>SCP-701 seems only slightly aware that it does not possess the physiological capacity for speech or any other human function, perceiving its lack of these faculties primarily as a nuisance rather than an inability.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
