<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-475</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-475 is currently contained at Site-19. Any civilian who has had contact with SCP-475 is to be detained and interrogated about the entity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-475 is a humanoid entity composed of multiple copies of the same person. These individuals describe a common history and experience, but can and will interrupt this narrative at any time in order to further the current SCP-475 narrative. Observations indicate that the entity's memories are limited and thus not able to recall information about itself.</p><p>SCP-475 first came to Foundation interest following a series of disappearances from an isolated town in [REDACTED]. This incident was referenced as 'The Exploitation Incident' by local authorities, who were quoted as saying 'All of our missing persons suddenly turned up at their homes'.</p><p>Later investigation revealed that several transient class personnel had been living temporarily in the town during their missions. One individual described the entity as 'a little weird', and stated that it had never been violent or violent towards them despite their attempts to interact with it. The last recorded sighting of this individual indicated that they had been assaulted by an unknown assailant; photographs taken at the scene indicated that the individual had most likely been terminated before reaching a hospital. Local authorities estimate between 40-60 deaths during this incident.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
