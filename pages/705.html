<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-705</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-705 must be kept in a minimum 10 cm x 25 cm containment chamber lined with lead. SCP-705 is to be kept under the constant supervision of two (2) level 3 staff members. No personnel are to handle SCP-705 without protective gloves and safety goggles. Should the order to activate SCP-705 be given, at least one (1) D-Class personnel within the perimeter of the chamber must be restrained by a safety harness and not allowed to approach or get near SCP-705 until it has been shut off.</p><p>Any bed sheets, towels, or pillows brought into SCP-705’s containment chamber must be lifted or torn before they reach it. Any items that have been deliberately torn into pieces or fluffed up must not be placed under SCP-705 in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-705 is a standard green and white plastic septic tank located in Site-██’s janitorial facilities. When not actively being watched, SCP-705 will sit dormant for roughly twenty (20) minutes before suddenly changing its shape. All of the following have been observed:</p><p>When SCP-705 has finished altering its shape, it will return to its normal state, at which point it will come under active observation from one (1) level 3 staff member. Should this staff member be lost or killed, SCP-705 will remain dormant for roughly fifteen (15) minutes until another level 3 staff member assumes their position.</p><p>SCP-705 does not appear to be affected in any way by heat or cold, and appears to be made entirely out of water. However, once inside of SCP-705, subjects are unable to breathe or contact any outside world. A number of theories exist as to how such an effect could be realized through physical means; however, they all seem to lead back to SCP-705’s anomalous nature. This also leads back to why SCP-705 was discovered in the first place.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
