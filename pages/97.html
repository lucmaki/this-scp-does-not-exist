<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-97</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-97 instances are to be monitored and identified by Foundation personnel following their discovery. Upon identification, specimens are to be stored at Site-16 in storage locker L-10, or as a specific instance of SCP-97, for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-97 is a phenomenon affecting the mental content of individuals who have read a given article from any publication of the magazine "Family Circle". SCP-97 has effects similar to memetic amnestic in that it will erase memories, feelings, and concepts related to the identified article from the affected individual. The effects are consistent with established memetics, and are considered to be the result of editing of emotions and memories.</p><p>The affected individuals have no unusual reactions or experiences during the process, but will have difficulty relating to items that they were previously familiar with. The original effect duration is three hours, but an upgraded containment procedure has been implemented in order to slow down the duration of SCP-97's effects and prevent permanent damage.</p><p>SCP-97 has multiple instances per magazine issue.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
