<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-410</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-410 is contained in a standard containment locker. A remote GPS transceiver is embedded into the anomaly at all times, and tracking devices have been placed on the remains of SCP-410's original fishing vessels. A small room has been constructed to house the bodies of SCP-410's crew and their equipment.</p><p>The bodies are to be kept in a state of decompression at 25 m/s, and monitored at all times for unknown reasons. Blood samples are collected weekly to monitor changes in their composition.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-410 is a fleet of two ghost fishing vessels, designated SCP-410-1 and -2. The vessels are composed of the same materials as regular fishing boats (see Containment Log 410A for details), but have been modified to function as normal boats, with the exception of loss of propulsion.</p><p>All crew members are presumed deceased. They do not respond to any stimuli from the outside world, including sonar or visual contact. They retain all memories they had while alive, but they cannot move or speak without the vessel's assistance. They appear as if they are asleep (see Containment Log 410B for details).</p><p>When the hulls of SCP-410-1 and -2 breach the surface of the ocean, they will teleport to another location. This location is determined by the location of their original vessel's location when they last were alive; in this way, it is believed that they are able to return to their home galaxy through a wormhole they created themselves at death. If a side effect would be too great after entering a new dimension, such as changing its gravitational pull or an event involving a nuclear explosion, then the entity will instead simply stay on the surface of the water until it can return home safely.</p><p>SCP-410 began affecting shipping traffic in 1952, when it first manifested along Route ██ of [REDACTED], ██████ over ███ days. A research vessel was sent to investigate, but lost radio contact and disappeared shortly after arriving at the area where SCP-410 was located at that time. After several failed attempts, SCP authorities elected to contain SCP-410 through seclusion. This was accomplished in 1955 by sinking one ship and taking all personnel with it. Several civilians were killed upon impact due to being inside homes nearby; Foundation cover stories were established using these deaths as an "accident" during recovery efforts.</p><p>The surrounding area was heavily damaged due to radiation levels produced by a nearby nuclear test site; molds and other biological contaminants were found on several objects during recovery operations in 1954 and 1955 (see Containment Log 410C). Inexplicable chunks of wood can be found throughout the ocean floor, though these are believed extinct prior to discovery.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
