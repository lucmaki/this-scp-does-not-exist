<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-785</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The site of SCP-785 is to be kept in a state of permanent quarantine. The area must be kept clear of all forms of life and unspoiled by any means possible, including but not limited to:</p><p>SCP-785 is to be held at Site-45's Bio-Containment wing. Containment protocols are to match those with any other instances of the Ecmeline virus, as well as the procedures for all Keter-class entities.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-785 is a virus, presumably derived from Ecmeline, the World of Darkness's version of rabies. It spreads rapidly, subjecting any mammals to contraction of it. When the virus reaches its host's brainstem, it will induce a detonation in the brain all but identical to that produced by the Ecmeline virus. However, unlike Ecmeline, SCP-785 does not kill off its host within 1 week. Instead, in addition to making victims headless and limbless as with Ecmeline, SCP-785 also infects their spinal cord. This enables the virus to continue replicating itself into the thoracic cavity, which greatly increases its efficiency at spreading.</p><p>Once this process has reached thoracic cavities on average 4 to 5 persons (determined by their size), viral production will cease; however, like Ecmeline, SCP-785 will be found in their bodies until they are cremated or otherwise disposed of.</p><p>Eventually, if the first few hosts have survived the infection's early stages (the same as Ecmeline itself), they themselves will bring down with them numerous other animals of prey and scavengers; these animals will then proceed to infect both plants and organisms indigenous to the area as well as nearby areas. Though most viruses tend to spread slowly over time before reaching critical mass (such as with [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP-106's anomalous fungus), SCP-785 is unique in that it can produce up to an astronomical number of hosts in such a short period of time.</p><p>All subjects who contract SCP-785 eventually develop specialized mid-section structures surrounding their spinal fluid and internal organs (see schematic) which gives off a constant low "hum" similar to that produced by televisions being left on while they are turned off. These structures collapse if removed from their hosts' body cavities intact, though this is incapable of causing any harm as long instruments used for removal have proven to be safe for humans once removed.</p><p>When subjects reach 80% destruction (18 meters' depth), only parts of their bodies are left intact: 2 legs each from 2 different subjects, 2 arms from 1 subject each and a skull as large as normal for its size on top of its body cavity. The subjects act completely normally throughout this stage aside from their lower limbs having been reduced to 5 fingers and 7 toes each, respectively. No other limbs have been observed; however, no limbs have ever been removed before destruction occurs entirely between 80% and 95%, so it is unknown whether an entire limb is lost during the first stage or later stages of destruction.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
