<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-40</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-40 is kept in a dedicated Safe SCP object locker at Site-77. SCP-40's anomalous properties are to be monitored remotely via webcam and/or audio contact. The film inside of SCP-40 is not to be removed under any circumstances (even for testing), as failure to do so will result in the anomalous properties of the film itself assuming control over the anomaly. Only an individual with Level 3 clearance or higher is permitted to view the film from outside of the camera's range, and even then only with Level 4 clearance or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-40 is a 35mm color film, found to date back to the 1930s. The film is printed on both sides with the same imagery, depicting a woman wearing a blue dress. The woman's face is always obscured by her hair or hands. The film shows no image of any kind except for the woman in blue, with no discernible images of time or place.</p><p>Once viewed, the viewer is subject to an immediate and involuntary reaction towards the woman in blue. However, the viewer should remain aware that their reaction is not shared with other observers, due to viewing the film once viewing it cannot result in more than one viewer having the same reaction. Subjects react with palpitation of heart chambers and experience feelings such as love, sexual arousal, jealousy, and similar emotions up until such a time as they have had the opportunity to see all 88 frames of the film. Affected viewers report that they feel pressured to view the entire film at once and will type or write out their observations afterwards afterwards.</p><p>Once an audience has seen all 88 frames of SCP-40, they are able to realize that there are 8 strings wrapped around the protagonist's neck in slightly different places, causing their growth of nails to scrape against their necks in various places regardless of what they do. Once this occurs, all subjects disappear from SCP-40's range (the computer screen) and reappear upon leaving this range, typically within 10 minutes of going into the "out" side of SCP-40's field of view. Upon entering again at any other time from now on, subjects will invariably attempt to leave SCP-40's range before it disappears; if permitted by security officers after initial identification, subjects who persist in attempting this will also be unable to escape SCP-40's field of view for approximately 12 hours after leaving it themselves and will require tranquilization for treatment.</p><p>It should be noted that any members belonging to O Research Team-4 who have made it through SCP-40's space time barrier show little familiarity with its contents besides those instances where they have had training with SCP-40 itself; none have shown any reaction when watching it repeatedly, or even realized they were sharing information they hadn't yet learned themselves (such as how most humans can identify disparate scenes by seeing them during sleep). This suggests that many aspects of SCP-40 require further study as possible Foundation meme groups as well as possible independent anomalies.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
