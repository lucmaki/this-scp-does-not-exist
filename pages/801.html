<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-801</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-801 must be stored, handled and transported as a liquid. The object should be kept in an opaque container, preferably one with a percentage of glass matching that of the object itself. In the absence of such containers, it is recommended to use [REDACTED]. A minimum of two security personnel are to remain on stand-by outside the container and are not permitted to leave without closure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-801 is a liquid substance composed of 83% normal gaseous hydrocarbons (HC), and 17% nitrogen. It exhibits no physical characteristics that would allow it to be separated from its liquid state, nor can it be contained in any form beyond its liquid state by means of containment procedures used with standard gases. SCP-801 is also not an explosive or flammable substance, despite the fact that it may still ignite when loosely piped, as shown in experiments.</p><p>SCP-801 has the unique ability to combine with anything combustible, such as wood, coal, petroleum products, wood chip shavings and other hydrocarbon-based materials and release nitroguanidine (NG2). NG2 is a highly flammable gas that combines with oxygen to cause flame, smoke and explosions.</p><p>The compound is especially effective on organic matter and water-based objects, most notably on plants. SCP-801 does not burn itself with combustion; however, if ignited on an appropriate surface, it will combine with the air to produce explosive nitroguanidine gas.</p><p>SCP-801 was originally retrieved from the ████████ Chemical Corporation located in Chicago which had been investigating methods of using hydrocarbon gases to develop new forms of weaponry rather than propellants or explosives. During testing, SCP-801 was accidentally discovered by one of the plant's workers and recovered by local authorities.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
