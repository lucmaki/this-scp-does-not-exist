<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-543</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-543 is currently located in a large containment chamber on Site-42, which is guarded by two armed security agents at all times. Access to SCP-543's containment chamber is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance or above. Any personnel found attempting to read SCP-543's surface without permission may be forcibly detained by the on-site guards and treated as an unidentified amorphous object-entity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-543 is a giant, humanoid figure, approximately 8 km tall. SCP-543's body is covered in large, rough patches of hair, and its limbs are relatively short. The figure's head is pointed and bulbous, with a small, round nose and dull eyes. SCP-543 wears a small loincloth around its waist. The figure appears to have no other features save for its arms, which have been severed below the elbow joint and have been replaced by several dozen mechanical arms of varying lengths attached to the base of SCP-543's neck via crude hoses. Its head is powered by an unknown energy source installed in the base of its neck.</p><p>SCP-543 has shown an incredible amount of hostility to any personnel attempting to observe its surroundings or interact with it. To date, all researchers attempting to study the entity have been either killed or severely injured by SCP-543's hostile behavior. No form of communication has been established between SCP-543 and Foundation staff at this time.</p><p>SCP-543's body is largely powered by a solar battery array situated on its back, though internal processes cause periodic discharges from the base of its neck (which resemble lightning) that occasionally create bright flashes within its containment chamber. These discharges appear to be triggered by the movement or proximity of any personnel within the vicinity of SCP-543.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
