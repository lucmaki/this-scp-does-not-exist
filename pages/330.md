<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-330</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-330 should be stored in a standard containment locker. The locker is to be checked every 48 hours, and any signs of damage or corrosion should be reported immediately. Any corrosion present on SCP-330 should be treated by an approved Level 3 Biohazardologist before further examination.</p><p>SCP-330 requires the presence of at least two (2) staff members in the presence of its activated state, due to its capacity for self-destructive behavior. While it must remain inside a containment locker, this does not restrict its usage as a power source for Xeno-Tech and other experimental purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-330 is a cylindrical object with a diameter of 1.75 meters, composed of a blue-green alloy (classified as Abrasilium). Classified as an Ion-Catalyzed Deposition (ICD) alloy, it has properties that mimic those of high-grade radioactive sludge. SCP-330 is not radioactive itself, but the presence of Xeno-Tech nano-machines within it can convert its mass into ionized radiation and emit gamma rays at a rate approximately one million times greater than standard units for nuclear wastes. The process has to be continuous for SCP-330 to maintain its anomalous state.</p><p>After discharging ionized radiation for 68 hours, SCP-330 will release a large quantity of compressed gas that fills the facility in which it is held. This gas consists of 67 different elements exceeding 1000 atomic mass units (AMU), except carbon (with a concentration of 340 ppmv), oxygen (with a concentration of 2.5%), nitrogen (with a concentration of 0.5%), hydrogen (with a concentration of 0.5%) and magnesium (with a concentration of 0,02%). Upon reaching the air pressure of 1 atmosphere, this gas will collapse into 3D-plasma fusion, creating an explosion powerful enough to penetrate any known protection system and generate temperatures exceeding six million degrees for prolonged periods of time.</p><p>The destruction caused by SCP-330 is unique in that it inflicts serious damage on all property, material and living organisms within the area affected. It does not affect anything outside its range entirely. In addition, due to the complexity and efficiency of their construction, all materials comply with their own particular destruction criteria:</p><p>All organic matter becomes intensely radioactive within seconds.</p><p>Wooden surfaces turn to ash over the course of minutes.</p><p>Concrete structures crumble under the impact from the gases released by SCP-330; this effect is proportional to the density at which they were constructed (the same applies to stone structures). The effect can be stopped by covering the affected area with an impermeable layer or putting down concrete or other constructed materials/walls over such areas as quickly as possible after initial occurrence. The latter method also stops any further oxidation processes occurring on such materials or areas.</p><p>Explosive devices are effective in halting SCP-330's effect; however, they only carry minimal protective properties against its effects and should only be used when containment procedures become compromised. Instances consist primarily of solid propellant boosters with enhanced explosive charges designed specifically for rapid deployment in explosive environments by SPAWAR weapons research division personnel following precise guidance from ground testing equipment(see Addendum 330a). Devices are dropped from aircraft preceeding to rendezvous with D-Class personnel stationed in secret locations around IACS installations worldwide for purposes described hereafter. All testing has been approved by O Command.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
