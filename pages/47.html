<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-47</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-47 is currently located in Site-77's safe-class storage locker. SCP-47 lacks an active anomalous effect and can not harm anyone, but as it is considered safe at this time, no further containment procedures are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-47 is a set of three rubber ducks, black in color. Two of these ducks are identical, measuring 4.4 cm in diameter and weighing 2.1 grams each. The third duck is smaller and has a different texture, with two pairs of fins on the bottom instead of one. With this duck, there are thirteen digits on each side of its body; the penguin's phalanges are divided into four segments.</p><p>SCP-47 appears as three objects when viewed under a microscope. The smallest duck (SCP-47-1) is composed of four components: a percentage sign (ℵ), a letter "Q" (for quanta), a number "0", and the letter "s", representing energy.</p><p>The middle duck (SCP-47-2) can be seen as units of time — each segment represents a second, and its pattern resembles the second hand of a clock. The largest duck (SCP-47-3) is composed of three bands, representing dimensions. It constantly rotates in space at an unknown rate between 0 and 1 radians per second; these dimensions may represent potential likelihoods to travel through alternate space-time paths. These three ducks have been shown to be capable of emitting light at different wavelengths depending on their intended use; for instance, SCP-47 emits light of red [REDACTED] when used for counting up to nine ducks simultaneously, but emits a wavelength matching the frequency band for white light when used in conjunction with SCP-47-2.</p><p>A fourth duck was reported to have been found in [REDACTED], but was lost due to [REDACTED]. Foundation personnel were unable to recover or gather any information regarding this fourth duck.</p><p>SCP-47 was recovered from [REDACTED], after satellite imagery showed it flying above the town on July 3rd 2011 by what investigators believed to be balloons carrying it away from its source location. In early 2012, SCP-47 was taken into Foundation custody after Foundation assets secured it from the United States Postal Service in Seattle, Washington. During transport by ██████████ Police Department armored transport vehicle, SCP-47 spontaneously animated, followed by spontaneous release of white light similar to that emitted by SCP-47-3 when transformed into its fully animate state. The police officers involved were all terminated after attempting to stop this event from occurring, resulting in the loss of [REDACTED]. When interviewed about this event Ceratopian claimed that he was unaware he was transporting objects with anomalous properties until his last words recorded by the police vehicle's taser camera system; Ceratopian stated that he never wanted to see those ducks again after seeing them fly away from him.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
