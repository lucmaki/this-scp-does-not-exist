<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-880</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-880 is to be contained in a cell at a regular Foundation prison facility. No staff other than the warden may enter SCP-880’s cell, except for testing personnel.</p><p>Due to the nature of SCP-880’s anomaly, its existence is to be denied to the general public by a Foundation disinformation campaign, known as Operation: Hijinks.</p><p>SCP-880’s cell is 4m x 4m in size. It contains only a bed. A wall of carbonite is installed on one end for physical containment. The door also has two layers of carbonite sealed on it, serving as an additional barrier from suicide attempts. During testing, no more than 2D-3F of waste products are released per day; assuming this holds true, this would provide adequate cover for the guards and prisoners to maintain the illusion of the cell being filled with human waste.</p><p>SCP-880 does not require any sleep, nor does it age or need food. However, it is expected that SCP-880 will eventually suffer from depression unless it receives regular mental stimulation from the staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-880 is a humanoid entity, 1.7m tall, weighing 75kg. It displays no visible signs of aging or deterioration over the decades it has been held in Foundation custody, despite being originally recovered at age 17. It was capable of successful speech until its incarceration; it did not speak to any staff and refused to communicate with other inmates, but did communicate with itself as well as other non-human entities. SCP-880 is agnostic and displays no interest in religion, philosophy or science and finds the concept of a conscious afterlife to be distasteful.</p><p>SCP-880 is indestructible, and can withstand temperatures ranging from −257°C to 572°C without sustaining damage. The only known means of destruction is incineration at temperatures higher than 572°C, which will result in total destruction of the body; however, this does not alter the mind or personality of SCP-880.</p><p>SCP-880’s anomalous effects do not become active until it is placed within an enclosed space with air, as explained below.</p><p>If all of the air in an enclosed space containing SCP-880 is then completely removed (e.g., via incineration), SCP-880 will enter a state of extreme aggression. The only known means of defeating SCP-880's aggression is the manual destruction of all oxygen in the area where it is present, so that no particles are left for SCP-880’s consciousness to interact with. However, this means that SCP-880 loses all its intelligence and cannot respond to verbal instructions or communication attempts unless it is "vitalised" by the previous removal of air from its location.</p><p>In addition to its aggressive nature, SCP-880 displays immunity to pain and trauma inflicted upon itself; this immunity provides no protection against damage to other objects unless they share SCP-880’s same immunity property, making physical containment impossible except by destroying oxygen molecules themselves. Due to this liability in standard containment procedures, several methods have been devised to allow limited escape for SCP personnel during testing sessions — these methods are summarised below:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
