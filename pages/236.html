<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-236</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-236 is stored in a storage locker belonging to Site-46. Access is to be restricted to personnel with proper clearance and authorization. Any personnel attempting to read SCP-236 or recover any transcription or related materials are to be denied access to SCP-236 until further notice. Should SCP-236 become compromised, a retrieval team may be dispatched to neutralize the effect and recover the original document.</p><p>No personnel are to view SCP-236 outside of testing. Should it become necessary for any member of the public to view SCP-236, it must be photographed. Document images are presently being stored in one of Site-47's secure areas for future retrieval. To date, no unauthorized information has been added at any point in the past. A digital copy is archived at the Foundation Library in Oxford, England and accessible on Research Assistant Dr. Harper's personal computer.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-236 is the original hand-written manuscript of a 2,900 word essay titled 'The Incredulity of Saint Thomas'. Written in its secondary natural coloration, SCP-236 was discovered by Foundation agents embedded in the Corpus Christi (Texas) city library system in 1989. The original document has been preserved and measures 3.35 m x 1.85 m.</p><p>Analysis has revealed no additional information on the circumstances surrounding SCP-236's discovery but gives an approximate date for when it was written.</p><p>ADDENDUM: On 03/11/2009, SCP-236 underwent a visible change in coloration and texture. The document then returned to its original state within the following five days. This process is currently ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
