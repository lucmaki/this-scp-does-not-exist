<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-795</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All relevant Foundation personnel are to make contact with the National Committee for Reclamation of the Southwest (NCRSWS) within the United States. The NCRSWS is to be monitored and any activity indicative of its dissolution is to be reported to new containment personnel.</p><p>The site of SCP-795 is to be guarded by a detachment of twelve armed security officers, stationed at a distance of 4 kilometers from the site. While strictly forbidden under the NCCSW's directive, any unauthorized visitors are to be immediately detained and interrogated for information regarding the present situation. All information acquired from detainees must be transmitted via encrypted channels after a standard interview has been conducted.</p><p>The entire site of SCP-795 must remain under 24/7 surveillance by Foundation personnel. All visitors to SCP-795 are to be kept at a safe distance of 2 kilometers, with their equipment and body armor inspected by on-site medical staff before being released. All prisoners who leave SCP-795 must remain visibly within sight of guards until they have been safely escorted away from the area.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-795 is a large area, approximately 30 square kilometers in area, located in the southwestern United States. SCP-795 is ringed by three fences, each 9 meters tall. Despite being made from wood and metal, these fences have proven to be quite resistant to damage; any attempt to destroy them has been unsuccessful in causing any damage to the wood or metal. At the center of SCP-795 is a group of tents; most are occupied by various religious organizations (such as the Peoples Temple Foundation, the Church of Scientology and the Church of Jesus Christ).</p><p>SCP-795 also contains a small graveyard that contains a large number of unmarked graves. Burials within SCP-795 are invariably accompanied by several guards and/or family members; according to statistics kept by witnesses, this occurs virtually every day. The bodies within SCP-795 appear to be human remains recovered from several locations across the Southwest United States.</p><p>There is no evidence that this phenomenon has occurred prior to 1983. However, there is some evidence that it began only recently – witness reports state that they are seeing more burials since 1987 than they were prior to that time. There have been no recorded deaths over this period.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
