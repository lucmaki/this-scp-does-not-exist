<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-576</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-576 is to be kept in a locked chamber at Site ██. SCP-576 may be observed for up to 20 minutes per day, and given full access to whatever food it wishes. All personnel assigned to SCP-576 must be aware that SCP-576 is a sentient being and not a test subject.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-576 is a humanoid creature resembling a male human in its early twenties. SCP-576's upper torso is covered in thick, brown hair, and its hands have fingernails of varying lengths. SCP-576 has been observed to wear a hospital gown that is not anomalous in any way.</p><p>SCP-576 will attempt to speak with any personnel who are assigned to it. In order to speak coherently, SCP-576 must be able to see the face of the person speaking to it at all times. If this is not possible, SCP-576 will vocalize in an unintelligible manner until it can be given visual access to the speaker. Once the speaker has stopped speaking, SCP-576 will attempt to perform actions dictated by the speaker in an effort to please them.</p><p>If something is said that causes SCP-576 to feel anger or sadness, it will attempt to mimic these emotions through physical motions until the speaker has ceased speaking. If the speaker does not cease speaking once SCP-576 begins mimicking their movements, SCP-576 will continue making motions until they become violent enough that they cause injury or death.</p><p>SCP-576 was discovered wandering near [REDACTED] after reports of multiple fatalities associated with persons infected with syphilis reached the Foundation's attention. Reports of "a poor little boy" being in contact with those affected by the disease were quickly investigated, resulting in the discovery of SCP-576.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
