<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-268</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-268 is to be stored at Containment Locker 66. The locker contains no additional measures for containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-268 is the upper torso of a female adult human, 1.95 m in height. SCP-268's head was never recovered and cannot be reattached to its body.</p><p>SCP-268 has a structure similar to that of a human spine (it has no cartilage or bone), but with significantly more vertebrae. The upper half of SCP-268's body has been extensively dissected by Dr. ███ and is mainly composed of muscle tissue with some bone in certain locations.</p><p>SCP-268 always trails behind its victims during any motor activity. SCP-268 appears to use this trail as an anchor for its movements, though it is difficult to determine whether it is an active pursuit or simply an over-compensating attempt to keep up. SCP-268 can extend itself upwards towards the ceiling at will; however, when not using this ability to escape, it will act as if it is unable to stretch beyond a certain point, such as reaching the underside of a doorway or stretching far enough to straddle two chairs without actually occupying both chairs at once.</p><p>SCP-268 has fleshy tentacles that are presumably used for grasping and manipulating objects, although their function is currently unknown. When attached to another person, these tend toward areas where the person would have difficulty reaching without assistance or leverage from SCP-268. For example, the tentacle attached to the left side of the back of Agent ██████'s neck would be positioned almost directly under the back of his jaw if he were able to move at all on his own while carrying SCP-268.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
