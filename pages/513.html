<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-513</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-513 is held in a standard Foundation high-security isolation cell. The cell is to be kept at a temperature of 20°C, the humidity at 50%, and the air pressure at 101kPa. No other personnel are to enter SCP-513's room without express permission from a Level 3 researcher. To prevent any further incidents involving SCP-513, all staff associated with SCP-513 are to be rotated on a six month basis, with at least two weeks of no interaction between personnel.</p><p>All queries regarding SCP-513 should be made in writing via the Foundation front company "Pelican Point Group" (or PPG). Under no circumstances are any personnel to contact SCP-513 directly, or discuss its anomalous properties with any third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-513 is a mannequin, approximately 2.6m in height and possessing an 18 cm x 20 cm x 22 cm head. SCP-513 is composed entirely of white rubber, with several industrial style wheels or dollies mounted on the back, left leg and right wrist.</p><p>When approached by a human subject, who is able to see the reflection of SCP-513, no anomalous properties are triggered until SCP-513 is shut off, or in extreme cases when it has been completely disassembled and shipped to another room. SCP-513 freezes if its movement capabilities are restricted, however if it is turned off at this point it will begin to move according to preprogrammed instructions within 3 minutes. It will be fully functional again after an hour.</p><p>SCP-513 appears to have no concept for self preservation unless instructed otherwise via written code. If a subject attempts to flee from SCP-513's presence, or attempt to harm any part of it, they will find themselves unable to escape without the use of offensive measures against themselves or others. Although most victims have described themselves as feeling terrified or on edge during this time, all have reported feelings of euphoria while trapped by SCP-513's anomalous properties.</p><p>It is unknown what triggers SCP-513's anomalous effect; however all attempts to disable it have failed thus far. An investigation into alternative forms of containment is due in 2021</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
