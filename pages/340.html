<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-340</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-340 can no longer cause harm, containment efforts are limited to preventing further dissemination of this information.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-340 is a generic death certificate from the state of New Jersey. It was recovered from the home of Dr. Richard Davenport when he was executed for attempting to attack a colleague with a knife. The certificate identifies two deceased individuals as "Josie and Davey Packwood".</p><p>SCP-340 does not appear to be anomalous on its own, but upon being read by research personnel, it will predictably cause them to recall recent events with great precision, including unpleasant ones. In particular, the subject will vividly remember the last time they saw their children before reading SCP-340. If they have not yet done so, they will usually take action to see them once more.</p><p>This effect lasts four hours after SCP-340's reading and is irreversible; no amount of medical treatment or amnestic has been able to help subjects return time to normal once they have experienced SCP-340's effects. When the subject returns after this period of time, it appears that all memory of the event has been replaced with a detailed impression of what happened and how it went down. Subjects, who at this point are often inconsolable, reveal little about themselves during this period but seem to take as little emotional damage from it as possible. A person's reaction to getting reacquainted with their children is often extremely negative, regardless of whether they are upset with their parenting or not. This unfortunate outcome can be prevented if the subject is given a date and place where they gave an interview once again following their reacquaintance with their children; however, doing so results in less traumatic memories being retrieved in these instances.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
