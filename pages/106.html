<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-106</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-106 is to be stored in an airtight steel container, located within a refrigerated vault at Site-██. SCP-106 is to be kept under observation at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-106 refers to a pair of large, amorphous gray objects approximately 1 m in length and 0.9 m in diameter, which move slowly and aggressively towards other substances. When SCP-106 comes into contact with a solid, it begins to consume the substance, using absorbed matter as energy to extend itself further. When SCP-106 is unable to absorb any more matter, it will create two new openings (referred to as "mouths") and attempt to expand from there.</p><p>When introduced to various liquids or solids, SCP-106 will begin consuming the liquid or solid with its mouths; if one of these openings is blocked off or sealed shut, SCP-106 is incapable of movement for a period of time equal to the length of the remaining opening. As SCP-106 expands and consumes material, its mass increases significantly, with growth occurring at an exponential rate when extended. If SCP-106 is not able to complete an expansion within 20 hours after initial contact with a solid or liquid, it will temporarily lose its ability to act as an individual object until such time as a new opening has been created; if this occurs while SCP-106 is located within an active Foundation containment unit, then it will be safely contained inside that container.</p><p>SCP-106 has no permanent form when mobile; instead it will move constantly around in search of more food sources. It displays no interest in human beings except during feeding times; when not actively eating, SCP-106 seems completely oblivious towards human beings unless they come into contact with it.</p><p>SCP-106 was recovered from the ██████ Hyenas' enclosure at Site-██ on ██/██/22██ at 9:00 AM local time; upon discovery, containment guards reported observing several members of the hyenas being devoured by the object. The substance was taken into Foundation custody shortly after but was not initially identified as anomalous; research began only after ██████ Hyenas were found missing from their enclosure and had been presumed eaten by SCP-106.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
