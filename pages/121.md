<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-121</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-121 is to be kept in a standard containment locker 1.5m x 2m x 1 cm. The object is made of stainless steel, with a weight of 10 kg. A small plexiglass cover is to be placed over the top part of the object, and to remain on at all times. SCP-121 is not to come into contact with any nonliving material, including human beings.</p><p>SCP-121 is good to use when the temperature drops below 22 °C (72 °F), or when the temperature rises above 40 °C (104 °F). When the latter occurs, a simple electric heater should be installed, and left running for at least 18 hours after the temperature falls again.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-121 is a stainless steel building with a height of 6.73m, and the base is 5m. The walls are free of openings, and have various square holes 3 cm in diameter. The base has a plexiglass cover over it, which has angles not matching any of the angles on the walls.</p><p>When temperature drops below 22 °C (72 °F), or when the temperature rises above 40 °C (104 °F), a miniature landscape appears on the wall of SCP-121. This landscape changes every week, enabling test subjects to monitor the effects. The landscape always has trees, mountains, houses, mountains with houses, etcetera. Pictures can be found at File 121-037-061-011-0001_V001_1.jpg to 121-037-061-011-0001_V001_15.jpg. The type of house is always a two-story house with balcony attached to second floor, and that balcony always has a person sitting on it.</p><p>SCP-121 was discovered by Agent ████████ in ████ following complaints regarding loud noises during local power outages for 50Kv transmission lines. During initial investigation agents noticed an anomalous building adjacent to power plant's substation, which was covered by barbed wire fence (see Incident Reports 021 and 022). Investigation into this building revealed that it was made of titanium oxide, not stainless steel as originally suspected. A small plexiglass cover was placed on top of the housing and this was taken to storage locker 1 for further testing.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
