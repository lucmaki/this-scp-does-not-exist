<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-612</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-612 is to be contained in a 10 m x 10 m containment cell located in Site-77's basement. SCP-612 is to be fed twice a week with its preferred food, which includes a variety of red meat (including blood), raw vegetables, and fruit. The cell is to be cleaned once a day and any waste or excrement from inside the cell is to be removed. Anytime the subject demonstrates anomalous properties, queries are to be made on the subject's intended course of action and any actions taken are to be reported back to Dr. Fakhir.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-612 is a humanoid entity constructed from steel, concrete and wood. SCP-612 appears to be male, standing at 1.7m tall, with long hair and a beard. Despite being made of steel and concrete, the subject is still able to walk around normally. In addition, the subject does not appear to age past the point where it was constructed. Should SCP-612 be damaged or destroyed in any way, its body will rematerialize back on its designated location within 48 hours of initial destruction. However, if the subject's internal organs are removed and exposed to oxygen for an extended period of time (e.g., while suspended in space), they will fall apart and rejoin SCP-612's body in which case the process can take up to 24 days to complete.</p><p>SCP-612 shows signs of selective amnesia regarding its existence and will frequently refer to itself as "Me, myself". This is a common trait among all parahuman entities known to human civilization; Foundation researchers are currently researching similar anomalous cases such as SCP-4213, SCP-201 and others to see if any other information is enabled by this condition.</p><p>SCP-612's anomalous properties manifest when it is brought outside of its containment cell for any reason, including sleep or resting periods (subject will not enter any state of slumber). When brought out, SCP-612 can freely travel anywhere within visible range using unknown means (the subject does not possess wings or similar physiology). While in transit however, SCP-612 is incapable of performing any actions without first requesting permission from someone who has met the criteria for an interview/interaction. Interviews may occur anywhere as long as both entities involved agree to it (e.g., vehicle driving down a road while conversing).</p><p>When questioned on its desired destination, SCP-612 will typically provide a short description of its intended destination that consists mainly of words relating to the current situation (e.g., 'I want it hot' or 'I want it smoky') or phrases that usually relate directly to its current state (e.g., 'You want your coffee'). The subject states that this is how it speaks every time asked about its intended destination; despite this however, if forced into an environment where it cannot perform actions due to lacking structural components in a contained location (e.g., within a closed environment without access to air) it has demonstrated that it can still speak normally (as far as we can tell) and cannot be prompted into revealing anything beyond this assumption that SCP-612 does not use language per say in the same way humans do due to being constructed.</p><p>The subject typically refuses interview requests unless given permission by other personnel who have previously met the criteria for an interview/interaction with the subject (please see Addendum 512 for further details).</p><p>It has been discovered that during interviews/interactions where the individual must make physical contact with others (such as touching another's face while speaking), they receive visions related to their surroundings at approximately 90% of instances when asked what their surroundings look like at present due to their anomalous nature. These visions are obtained by most subjects upon making direct physical contact with another living being; differences between subjects include if visual input occurs through sight or touch depending on whether they have handled another being previously.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
