<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-94</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-94 is to be held in a standard containment locker, and is to be inspected twice per day by no fewer than two staff members. If a wheel of the object's nature changes its color, a level 3 security breach protocol is to be enacted.</p><p>The object itself should not be disturbed while the tank containing it is filled with water. Testing on SCP-94 should only be carried out by at least two Level 2 researchers and one Level 3 researcher. Personnel encountering SCP-94 while it is in motion require immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-94 appears to be an ordinary bicycle, except the wheels have acquired properties previously unknown. When a rider uses SCP-94, the wheels will spin indefinitely. The object's anomalous behavior ceases when it is completely submerged under water in a tank or fenced off area. Testing has shown that if SCP-94 is not soaked in water, its anomalous properties will resume if the object is brought back indoors.</p><p>SCP-94 was recovered from [REDACTED] on ██/██/19██. The object was brought in by local police officers who were investigating the disappearance of six children from [REDACTED]. A Foundation agent posing as a news reporter dispatched to the scene of the disappearances was able to recover SCP-94 and prevent its destruction by police officers.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
