<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-234</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-234 is to be contained within a standard containment locker in the Site-17 armory. Standard Class-D personnel are to monitor SCP-234's containment and must have authorization to enter the containment locker at all times.</p><p>Any study of SCP-234 requires approval from Dr. ██████, currently assigned to this SCP object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-234 is an old Sternberger Biber ship's bell, which exhibits signs of genuine age, and is estimated to date from the late 19th century. The exterior of SCP-234 has several dents and ding marks, the approximate location of which corresponds with the locations on the Sternberger Biber ship, "District of Columbia". The interior of SCP-234 has been cleaned and polished, and includes a set of intricate engravings (see Addendum 234-1) covering all of its surfaces.</p><p>The engravings are in German, and appear to have some sort of religious significance as they involve the depiction of waves, clouds and a portrait of ████ ████, the leader of the ██████████ sect (sometimes referred to as The Brotherhood) that worships ████.</p><p>SCP-234 will not react to any other bells. When SCP-234 is struck, it emits a low chime and produces what appears to be steam from its interior. This steam then condenses into a spherical mass at approximately a meter in diameter. Ascertaining that this sphere is composed mostly of solidified water vapour is difficult because it appears to be shifting and wavering in gaseous form [see Addendum 234-2].</p><p>This mass will then rise off the surface of SCP-234 in a slow spiral motion towards the ceiling. It remains suspended in this position until SCP-234 has been struck a number of times. During this time, both the water vapour and SCP-234 will appear to have some kind of structure at its core; though it is unclear what this structure actually consists of or if there is even one.</p><p>After about five minutes, the mass will break apart into thousands upon thousands of extremely fine droplets that appear to continually coalesce over each other before falling back towards SCP-234 again in an identical manner. After thirty minutes or more, these droplets appear to have evaporated completely from view. However, samples taken from SCP-234 after this time have shown no significant change compared to existing samples since their discovery by Foundation personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
