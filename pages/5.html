<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> 3 km area surrounding the SCP-5 anomaly is to be fenced off and patrolled by Site-23 personnel on duty at X███. Any civilians who enter the area are to be detained, administered Amnestics, and released at Site-23's discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5 is an area of 3 km radius centered around SCP-5's location, which contains no trees at all. Any objects that remain inside the area are ejected from it after approximately 12 hours. Objects ejected from SCP-5 do not continue moving in a straight path, but instead proceed to fall at a rate of approximately 10 meters per minute toward Earth.</p><p>SCP-5 was discovered on X███, when the Foundation learned of an incident involving a US government facility and the murder of a US soldier who had been assigned there for training purposes. After an investigation, SCP-5 was identified as the cause of the phenomenon. The area was secured by cleanup teams, and further investigation revealed that the anomaly had been present since 1970, with no known cause or explanation as to how it appeared or how it disappeared.</p><p>Despite this, several incidents in 1999 strongly suggested that SCP-5 was alive, although no witnesses were able to confirm such reports due to being inside SCP-5 while they took place. In addition, several similar artifacts were discovered in various locations around northern Europe during this time, but these were dismissed as hoaxes until Site-23 personnel confirmed their existence and the anomalous effects they produced themselves.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
