<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-551</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-551 is to live in a cell measuring 5.5m x 3.2m. SCP-551's diet and exercise schedule are decided by the Site Director, who should inform the researcher assigned to SCP-551 at least a week in advance.</p><p>SCP-551's health may be assessed remotely by means of video link, or the test subject may be brought to the site, currently Area-211 ("The Highlands"), in order to provide an in person assessment.</p><p>Any tests involving live animals must involve only those that pose no risk of being painful or fatal to humans; only personnel with appropriate training should handle non-human test subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-551 is a Caucasian male, 25 years old, who speaks fluent English and Spanish, with some proficiency in French, Portuguese and Japanese. In addition, SCP-551 has learned basic knowledge of Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese and German.</p><p>SCP-551's body mass index is significantly below normal for a human of similar height; however, all other physiological data is within the average range for a healthy human male. It should be noted that SCP-551 does not appear to lack the standard complement of organs and internal systems required for life in a human body.</p><p>SCP-551's civilian name is (deceased), but his status as an SCP object makes this identification impossible. At the time of this writing, SCP-551's origins remain unknown. SCP-551 claims that he was born to a short-term slave owner in ████, Mexico, but his memory of his childhood is completely non-existent prior to beginning middle school.</p><p>The cause of SCP-551's amnesia is not understood at this time. He appears to have forgotten everything about himself except his own name; he cannot remember his childhood or any aspect of his adolescence before the age of 17. It should also be noted that no aspect of his personality was altered as a result of this memory loss; he does not seem to have developed any sort of sociopathic tendencies or personality traits that might suggest repression by another individual (such as those exhibited by MTF Shaker). Further investigation into SCP-551's childhood history may reveal possible links to other anomalies in the area at the time; such information will be used only after approval from Site Director Dr ██████.</p><p>Regardless of the reason for SCP-551's amnesia, he will continue to forget new information until a sufficiently long period passes for him to take notice of it again. Remarkably little sensory information reaches his brain during periods when he cannot recall new facts: apart from eyesight and hearing, none of his senses appear to function normally when he cannot interact with others in any way whatsoever. However, research indicates that at least some part of his brain remains active even when he cannot consciously think or remember events which would normally excite him; instead he will retain what could be viewed as a "mental snapshot" from this state. Some researchers believe that these snapshots are flashes into an alternate reality where nothing has happened; however, Foundation psychiatrists have identified no abnormal mental conditions in these individuals during their flashbacks episodes.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
