<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-528</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area around SCP-527 is to be monitored by Foundation assets via satellites, and all nearby civilian groups are to be contacted and reported to the Foundation as potential instances of SCP-527.</p><p>All civilian groups likely to exhibit symptoms of SCP-527 are to be detained under the guise of existing in a state of emergency (such as an earthquake or hurricane) and administered Class-C amnestics and assigned class 2 authorization codes. Civilian groups found to be affected by SCP-527 are to be reclassified as instances of SCP-527, and any information regarding them is to be erased from public records.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-527 is a phenomenon that affects any group of persons currently residing in one location, causing them to manifest an interest in moving to another location. SCP-527 is caused by the presence of SCP-527-1, a gravitational anomaly located in the Pacific Ocean near the Solomon Islands.</p><p>SCP-527 is currently only present within a 5 kilometer radius of SCP-527-1.</p><p>The first person to enter this area after sunrise will become afflicted with SCP-527. Affected individuals will remain at the location they originated from until sunset, despite efforts by Foundation personnel to relocate them.</p><p>If no subject becomes afflicted with SCP-527 within two weeks, it will disappear; this has been observed over ██ occasions.</p><p>SCP-527 was discovered by Foundation personnel following reports of an extended period of time without an instance manifesting. Upon investigation, it was determined that all instances had moved within two weeks of each other and were residing within 2 kilometers of SCP-527-1.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
