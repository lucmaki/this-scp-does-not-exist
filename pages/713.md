<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-713</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-713 are currently contained within a large containment locker at Site ██. Individual instances of SCP-713 have been individually contained in their respective lockers, with exceptions for "Greg 1" and "Greg 4," who are collectively contained in a single containment unit with one table and four chairs.</p><p>The following conditions must be met prior to an instance of SCP-713 being released from containment:</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Instances of SCP-713 are human males aged 17 to 42 years old. Instances of SCP-713 display no bodily deformities or abnormalities, although these individuals do have an unusual habit of urinating through the nose. All instances of SCP-713 uniformly exhibit a love for all things pizza and beer, especially when it comes to pizza 'dough' and pizza beer (see Addendum). While not uncommon, instances of SCP-713 will invariably consume at least one slice of pizza or one bottle of beer on a daily basis if not more.</p><p>Instances of SCP-713 are also incapable of drinking water due to the lack of a nasal cavity, which is present in every instance. Due to this, every instance is unable to absorb any nutrients from items that are consumed in other forms than liquid. Despite this, none have suffered permanent damage or health problems as a result.</p><p>In addition to their weakness to liquids, instances of SCP-713 also possess an intense dislike for all things feminine such as the sound produced from female laughter, female flatulence, and the smell of women's perfume; however, an extremely high amount of alcohol will break their aversion to these things.</p><p>Instances of SCP-713 cannot discern between sight and smell. If an instance is blindfolded, it will make every attempt to remove the blindfold and examine its surroundings with its nose. If a subject is blindfolded with scented substances on the hand that touches the eye covering the subject's eyesight, the instance will be able to remove the blindfold and take a sniff at the substance. This behavior has lead to several experiments into "objective" tests using anomalous objects in order to determine whether or not an anomaly can be detected through an object's smell rather than just sight. These attempts have been unsuccessful up until date.</p><p>While most individuals are disgusted by their actions or by what they may consider uncleanness or vulgarity, there are some instances that exhibit an extreme urge to emit certain smells at random times or in specific areas; this has lead some researchers to speculate that these individuals are suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome or a similar condition.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
