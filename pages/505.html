<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-505</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-505 is to be kept in a humidity controlled storage locker. A regular checkup of the item's surface is to be conducted every month, as well as its removal for maintenance.</p><p>Following this procedure, SCP-505 is to be returned to containment, and should be stored in a separate room.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-505 is a black-and-white photograph of the front page of The New York Times. The image depicts an unidentified woman in her mid twenties, dressed in what appears to be an off-the-shoulder dress with red writing on the right side of the garment. She is standing in front of a sunset; the image suggests that she was taking a photograph outside. On the left side are embossed the words “TODAY IN A NEW YORK MINUTE”. Despite being somewhat faded and torn, it is impossible to determine if any other text appears on the clothing.</p><p>SCP-505 exhibits no other anomalous properties.</p><p>Incident 505-1: On 14 August 1980, SCP-505 was contained in a storage locker owned by ██████ Public School. During its transfer, the locker door opened and a swarm of flies emerged from inside. Hallways were also observed to become unusually crowded due to the large number of flies that had arrived.</p><p>In order to halt this effect, as well as prevent further damages, Researcher Collins had to quarantine both school and locker room for over three hours while working on containing this incident. By 21:46, all flies had been destroyed using insecticide spray and SCP-505 was returned to containment.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
