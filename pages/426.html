<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-426</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-426 is currently contained at Site ██, hidden within a nondescript wooden cabinet. Access to SCP-426 requires the approval of Level 4/426 staff members. In the event of an emergency, any personnel with level 2 clearance or higher may gain access to SCP-426 for the purpose of restoring power or initiating rescue.</p><p>SCP-426 is to remain in its cabinet at all times. When not being used for testing, clearance staff may unlock the cabinet to retrieve SCP-426 for testing purposes, provided it is within a ten (10) meter radius of their position.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-426 is a non-functional computer keyboard sold by █████ ██████████, an electronics company based in Miami, Florida. The original packaging states that SCP-426 costs $34.95.</p><p>When a program is stored into SCP-426 for five (5) minutes and one (1) keystroke made, SCP-426 will begin speaking the contents of the saved program to any nearby personnel. Audio output from SCP-426 is always unintelligible gibberish, but visual output appears as a two (2) dimensional representation of the programming area where the "down arrow" function is utilized.</p><p>SCP-426's vocalized program contains nonsensical phrases such as:</p><p>SCP-426 will continue its vocalization for around five (5) minutes before ceasing. Unless retrieved at once, SCP-426 will repeat the same phrase until all memory space has been filled.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
