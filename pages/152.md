<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-152</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> To prevent the direct entry of any other, similar phenomena into this anomaly, no less than four amnestics, each at least 30 mg in mass, must be maintained in its vicinity. As SCP-152 is large enough that visual detection is currently impossible, it must instead be discovered by anomalous means and contained.</p><p>In order to contain SCP-152, all known information regarding the phenomenon must be suppressed, especially any scientific publications. Any anomalies or values discovered as a result of SCP-152 must also be suppressed.</p><p>With the exception of Protocol 153-Nephila and SCP-1181, instances of SCP-152 are to be kept in site-specific humanoid containment units (one per site) until discovery of an adequate way to contain them. Special attention should be paid to SCP-1181 as reports regarding it's size/locomotion are inconsistent. Currently, two such sites are under investigation (see attached Document 1).</p><p>Due to SCP-152's long shelf life, no less than three separate advertisement campaigns must be conducted every year to suppress knowledge of SCP-152 among the general public. Each campaign should last a minimum of five years. All other attempts at containment of SCP-152 are considered inadequate and have been deemed moot by O Command.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-152 is an empty, mountainous region in the Pacific Ocean. The region has a maximum size of 260km in diameter and a height of 1500 meters above sea level. This area has no average elevation or topography due to the small number of islands and mountainous areas inside SCP-152, compared to other islands surrounding it. This makes it almost impossible to detect SCP-152 visually and poses a significant logistical challenge for any field agent attempting to enter the anomaly.</p><p>As SCP-152 lacks any significant sources of terrestriality, it is presumed that the anomaly only affected what was once land, before being evacuated. It is currently theorized that SCP-152 originally went through much the same process as that of many large, underwater volcanoes on Earth did over time: rather than slowly eroding, SCP-152's contained islands would have simply been erased along with their previous inhabitants.</p><p>The only known method of entry into SCP-152 is via SCP-1181. The area affected by SCP-1181 appears to be a zone around 6 km in diameter where the mountains of SCP-152 are displaced and irregularly shaped. Once a pilot exits SCP-1181, they will find themselves within SCP-152 unless their exit point is blocked off by another instance of SCP-1181.</p><p>SCP-1181 appeared simultaneously at two separate locations on November 18, 1996: one near ████████████ and ████████, and another near ██████████ Island (see attached Document 1). A temporal anomaly was detected at each location where they appeared (Document 2). As such, we cannot definitively determine if one occurred first than the other. Each instance would appear and then dissipate after 2 minutes and 20 seconds before appearing again until this self contained timeline could be reestablished outside of said anomaly (see Document 2).</p><p>Each instance displays a unique behavior pattern depending on what time period it originates from; for example, an instance that originated from sometime in the 1970s or 1980s will display similar anomalous properties to those originating from earlier dates than this one. To date, five instances have been discovered (see attached Document 1), with some known information regarding them below:</p><p>SCP-1181 contains manifestations specific to its time period as per following:</p><p>SCP-1181 itself does not seem to affect knowledge of any of these facts and seems to be limited on what it can do due to its size; however, if it were able to travel backwards through time, we may be able to create a scenario where we can use it to eliminate anomalies which could pose an existential threat in the future.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
