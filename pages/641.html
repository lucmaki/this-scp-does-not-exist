<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-641</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-641 is currently contained in a standard containment unit at Site-34 for testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-641 is an anomalous elevator located in a five story office building. SCP-641 functions normally when the elevator is not being used, but all persons who attempt to enter or exit SCP-641 will die instantly.</p><p>This does not apply to any objects that are physically attached to an instance of SCP-641 at the time of entry, as these objects will simply fall a floor and remain unharmed. If an object is physically removed from the instance of SCP-641 while it is being used, they will also die instantly.</p><p>Although this effect only occurs when entering or exiting the instance of SCP-641, attempts to activate it by otherwise pushing buttons have resulted in Level Z personnel dying instantly. Always accompanied by the sound of a door slamming shut, the corpses of Level Z personnel have shown no other physical signs of damage.</p><p>Equipment placed near an instance of SCP-641 begins to malfunction immediately after being connected.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
