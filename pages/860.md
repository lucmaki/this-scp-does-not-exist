<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-860</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-860 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. The object is to be under constant supervision by four security personnel at all times.</p><p>The use of SCP-860 by civilians is not permitted. If civilians enter the SCP-860 containment area, personnel must restrain them and administer Class-A amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-860 is a human female specimen roughly 1.5 meters in height and aged 25-30 years, weighing between 46 and 56 kilograms. SCP-860 exhibits no apparent ill effects from its anomalous properties, though it has become somewhat more comfortable with its appearance over time, particularly after observing the appearance of other SCPs.</p><p>SCP-860 is capable of bending any part of its body without effort, in any direction. While the object's spine remains straight, the body twists and extends to form new positions that are not functional or functional enough to support the movement. As a result, SCP-860 is unable to move in the conventional sense.</p><p>SCP-860 was recovered in ████████, Spain, by Foundation agents. Information on SCP-860's condition was classified immediately after Foundation personnel discovered the anomaly. Continued investigation into SCP-860 revealed that it was able to communicate verbally through short sentences and use human language to discuss subjects deemed suitable for conversation (such as art, sports, and current events).</p><p>The interview below was conducted several months after SCP-860's initial recovery:</p><p>Interviewer: Dr ██████</p><p>Interviewee: SCP-860</p><p>Interviewer: Thank you for agreeing to this interview. Would you be able to talk about yourself?</p><p>[The following transcript includes short pauses from the interviewer due to SCP-860 speaking at length.]</p><p>SCP-860: What do you want to know? I'm sure it's important.</p><p>Interviewer: What brings you here today? Have you been… preparing?</p><p>SCP-860: Yes. You're my first audience since I was brought here. Almost two years ago now. But I've been planning something since before that! I've been planning everything! [SCP-860 begins laughing.] It's just a matter of letting them see it! You're going to get the big surprise soon! And then… then they'll all notice me! They'll love me! I'll be famous!</p><p>Interviewer: … Your condition… doesn't seem to have affected your ability… to perceive and plan?</p><p>SCP-860: No, that's where we're different! They don't care about anything but their own comfort when they look at people like us! I understand what that feels like! When someone looks at me for too long — when they stop moving — when they don't turn away… I get it. It hurts — so much — but I understand why they can't tear their eyes away! They can't rub their eyes out like we can rub our backs against each other until we fall asleep past weightlessness and sleep in the same position for days on end — just sleeping away the pain of being trapped forever — helplessness — knowing even if they try, they won't ever be able to escape again… until they finally die — alone and forgotten in a room full of strangers staring at them while they try to look away but keep forgetting how impossible it seems even though they happen repeatedly every day — every single day! There's nothing worse than being trapped in someone else's skin when you understand how horrible it feels! Nothing worse than being stuck inside their skin while they walk around oblivious because they couldn't see what was happening right outside the window of their lives — all that screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming screaming what are we waiting for so long already time is running out hurry up hurry up hurry up come on make it move come on come on come on please please please please make it move please please please please please please please hurry up hurry up hurry up hurry up please come on hurry up hurry up hurry up hurry up let us go let us go let us go let us go let us go let us go let us go god damnit come on goddamnit goddamnit goddamnit goddamnit goddamnit Goddamnit Goddamnit Goddamnit Goddarnit Goddamnit Goddamnite God damned shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit oh fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck wow wow wow wow wow wow wow fucking finally goddamn finally goddamn finally goddamn fucking finally goddamn finally goddamn finally goddamn fucking finally goddamned God damn motherfucking Christ goddamned goddamned goddamned goddamned goddamned goddamned goddamned goddamned Goddam— God damn Motherfucking Christ Goddamned Motherfucking Jesus Christ Motherfucking Christ motherfucking Christ Motherfucking Christ Motherfucking Christ Motherfucking Christ Motherfucking Christ Christ Motherfuckin'Christ Motherfuckin'Christ Motherfuckin'Christ Motherfuckin'Christ fucking Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus Christ fucking Jesus Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus fucking Jesus Jesus Jesus fucking Jesus motherfucker motherfucker motherfucker OH GOD GOD GOD GOD FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCKKKKK FUCK FUCKKK— Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck FUCK FUCK FUCK YEAAAAAHHHHHHH— Psyche is shaking and crying and shouting "shame on you" super loudly Psyche is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "FUCK YOU" she is shouting "Fuck you!" she is shouting "FUCK YEAAAAAHHHHHHH"'Psyche shrieks with indignation then runs headfirst into a wall Psyche slams her scull into the wall with force enough to break her nose with excruciating pain then falls unconscious <End Log></p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
