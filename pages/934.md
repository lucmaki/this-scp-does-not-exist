<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-934</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A division of Agents of Containment is to monitor the web site "Steel Armaments and Weaponry" in the event of any significant changes in its content.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-934 is a web site created by an individual calling themselves "Sigma", and hosted on the PiratedHosting.com server. SCP-934 depicts human beings of various ethnicities with arms or legs modified to resemble objects classified as anomalous; these objects are given different names in each caption. The captions of SCP-934's photographs display a great affection for the material they are altered into, with most captions expressing at least some level of excitement over its shape or function.</p><p>In addition to the photographs and captions, SCP-934 includes an extensive writing section. Several sections of SCP-934's descriptions are notable for their unusual phrasings and content.</p><p>Currently, SCP-934 contains 93 photographs depicting 94 separate instances of SCP-001. These instances do not always correspond with their description:</p><p>SCP-934 also contains several text files which are not accessible by standard web browsers. These files contain the following text:</p><p>Much of the text contained within these files is illegible due to frequent use of vulgar languages, but several lines appear to be references to specific locations and events within the Foundation. It is currently hypothesized that these texts were written by a member of the "Steel Armaments and Weaponry" community, who has been known to perform experiments involving SCP-934 agents.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
