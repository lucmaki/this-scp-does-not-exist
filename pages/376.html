<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-376</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-376 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell measuring 5.0m x 7.2m at Site-77. SCP-376 is to be provided with a standard diet of salted fish and bird eggs, along with a toilet and water tank for personal use. Any instances of SCP-376 are to be moved via remote vehicle to an area clear of all human habitation, after which the instance is to be cremated or buried in urned composting ashes. No object or living being is to enter the containment area until proper containment procedures have been completed, nor the area opened until that time. Motion detectors will alert security personnel whenever an instance of SCP-376 makes an attempt to leave the containment area.</p><p>Security personnel are not permitted to approach SCP-376 without Level 4 authorization; if this fact ignites conflict between two individuals, the individual attempting to approach SCP-376 may be subdued by security personnel and remanded to medical attention. The personnel attempting a dialogue with SCP-376 must remain in view and contact at all times; failure to comply will result in termination and removal of cover identity codeword.</p><p>Individuals who come into contact with SCP-376 are advised to maintain eye contact with any source of light within two meters. Smiling at light sources may also aid in maintaining cover identity. If a target fails to maintain eye contact with a source of light, or exhibits panic, the cover identity is assumed compromised and terminated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-376 is a human female (hereafter referred to only as SCP-376-1) in the early stages of [REDACTED], and is capable of producing an extreme amount of heat. No bodily fluids are produced by SCP-376; instead, it creates an extremely intense flame that extends from its head. The force of this flame can be used to ignite nearby flammables, including organic matter and inorganic materials, but this effect has no other stimulatory properties. SCP-376 may only create one flame at a time.</p><p>SCP-376's body temperature is approximately 9,200°C; however, depending on the surroundings and lighting conditions, it may appear to have a blood temperature slightly lower than normal (approximately 6,900°C). According to interviews with D-Class personnel, SCP-376 exhibits strong social norms for proper behavior when it comes time for them to sleep or rest, but has been known to be violent towards those that do not follow these rules.</p><p>Though no known biological or chemical changes occur within the body of SCP-376 when it is exposed to a flame, they do exhibit short term memory loss in areas such as language comprehension. Subjects who had been in regular contact with SCP-376 before exposure show no signs of memory loss (see Document 376-1). While the memory loss does not seem to coincide with the events that occurred during their exposure to flames, the exact way that this anomalous effect develops is still unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
