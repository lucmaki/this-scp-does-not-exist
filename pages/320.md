<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-320</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-320 is contained in a secure, closed, storage facility. Any documented theft or loss of SCP-320 is to be reported immediately to security personnel and the local police. No unauthorized interaction with SCP-320 is allowed under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-320 is a plush, stuffed animal of the genus Rosa (a type of rose). It measures approximately 2m tall, weighs 100 kg, and was manufactured by German toy company Schleich in 1986. SCP-320 is generally pink in coloration, with red spots splattered on its underside.</p><p>SCP-320 has no anomalous properties on its own; however, when handled by a human being, it will manifest several minute spikes, called 'petals', which will burst from its body at random, usually protruding from SCP-320's side. SCP-320 is otherwise harmless to humans, often sitting around in public places and displaying normal behavior.</p><p>When these petals are removed and planted into soil, they will grow into roses. Roses derived from SCP-320 are capable of producing seeds (the entire flower and everything inside) which will then germinate and grow into new members of the Rosaceae family. Roses produced from SCP-320 have shown no anomalous properties other than the ability to grow from the petals themselves; all have been bred to contain a genetic component that allows them to produce corn kernels (the rose's fruit) as well as seeds. Seeds produced by SCP-320 have been able to survive up to 12 months without water once dry; however, they remain viable for only an average of three days after being watered. Once seeds are left uncultivated for longer than three months, they will begin to wither and deteriorate rapidly outside of their container or while still in their seed form in excess of 15 degrees Celsius.</p><p>The process the rose uses to create seeds is currently unknown; however, details are available through experimentation with altered roses derived from SCP-320. See Addendum 320-1 for details.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
