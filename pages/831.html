<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-831</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All tanks housing SCP-831 instances are to be fitted with internal air filtration systems. No materials which fall under red or yellow toxic categories are to be allowed in any of the tanks housing SCP-831 instances.</p><p>Before each experiment, all staff are to undergo screening for viral and bacterial infection. Staff that test positive will unfortunately be forced to leave the building until their condition improves.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-831 is an organism consisting of a single cell type, human erythromyces-bunyardii. SCP-831 instances are genetically identical to normal cells that would be found in a human body.</p><p>CLASP-831 (Complete Life Analysis Support Platform 831) is a Mac computer, built specifically for SCP-831 research. SCP-831 is capable of analyzing any and all data produced by the computer, acting as a storage device and processor all in one. As part of these precautions, the computer must have no less than 3 hours of uninterrupted power supply, and must be kept indoors at all times.</p><p>SCP-831 has the ability to generate another instance of itself, although whether or not this will occur under normal circumstances is unknown. An SCP-831 instance can be grown from any cell with an extremely high number of chromosomes, usually reaching levels of 200 or more. The process is inefficient however due to the low efficiency at which new organisms grow and the large size of the initial cells being used as templates.</p><p>SCP-831 can survive in any environment that would support standard laboratory lifeforms (including non hazardous ones), but does not require food or oxygen to sustain itself. It also does not cause any changes in cells it comes into contact with, although this could be a result of its being a single cell organism rather than being naturally resistant to such effects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
