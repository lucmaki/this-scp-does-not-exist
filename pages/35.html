<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-35</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The park with the stairway in question is to be monitored via webcams by SCP personnel. Any instances of SCP-35-1 are to be contained and transported to site security to be studied and removed as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-35 is a phenomenon occurring at ██████ Park in ███████████, TX. The phenomenon appears to occur every Sunday between 11AM and 1PM, with an average of 5-10 instances produced per day, although this number varies wildly.</p><p>The stairway in question is currently the only place where SCP-35 can be seen. Attempting to view the stairs from other areas of the park will result in a change in location for any nearby instances (i.e. to a balcony, a stairwell or open space). Instantaneous photographs taken from different points around the park will all show the same instance of SCP-35 when viewed from the same point.</p><p>Instances are not limited to the stairway at ██████ Park: They can be found elsewhere in and around town on any of the days that they occur, with no appearance pattern recorded.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
