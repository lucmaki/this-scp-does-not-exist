<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-297</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-297 is currently contained in a ████/██ containment chamber at Site-████ as a result of its anomalous properties. SCP-297 is to be kept under constant observation with hidden cameras and motion detectors, and is to be inspected twice daily. No personnel are to enter the containment chamber without undergoing Level-1 background check and approval.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-297 is an arcade located in the ████ strip mall in [REDACTED], USA. SCP-297 is a traditional arcade cabinet, except for a large glowing neon sign that displays "INTER-DIMENSIONAL ARCADE" on it. No other signs can be seen inside or outside the cabinet. Although SCP-297 seemingly exists within an independent dimension from our own, until recently, it was believed to be a manifestation of our own collective subconscious through confusing and cryptic clues that were never properly understood by the Foundation.</p><p>SCP-297 appears to contain highly advanced technology, especially when compared to most arcade cabinets of this time period, including [DATA EXPUNGED] technology with encrypted security programs that are capable of handling higher versions of computer systems toward present day. These may be related to the mysterious games being played within the cabinet. For example, a game titled "Interdimensional Tetris" can be unlocked once the main game has been completed, but there is no clear explanation as to how one gets to play this particular game. The only known way of playing this game is entering through the door at the front of the cabinet and pressing a hidden button on the bottom of left side panel. The internal tracking system will activate followed by several screens displaying blinking stars and planets on a black background before returning back to normal gameplay. The player will start stuck in a loop after completing this section. Other than these minor details, there are no further information available regarding these presumed titles or any further information regarding why they are being played as they are.</p><p>If any individual other than Site personnel (currently listed below) attempts to enter either the front door or right side panel doors, they will receive an error message stating 'UNPREVENTED ACCESS DENIED' and audio recording devices found nearby will immediately cease functioning without fail and all security camera footage suddenly becomes blank for 2 hours after the point of entry is detected by site personnel in order to prevent any outside interference from occurring in regards to both access attempts between personnel or unauthorized objects from outside location deemed as possible threats.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
