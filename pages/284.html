<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-284</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutral</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All written literature, photographs and other media concerning SCP-284 is to be reviewed for anomalous references.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-284 is a small, tropical island off the coast of the Amazon River Delta in South America.</p><p>The island is uninhabited and has been isolated from the mainland for over two hundred years. The only form of life on SCP-284 are two large iguanas which roam its surface.</p><p>No notable changes have occurred on SCP-284 since it first appeared, although it does appear to be more barren than usual.</p><p>SCP-284's anomalous nature manifests when any person (see Addendum 284) who reads or hears a literary work describing it, or observes photographs or other media portraying it, will develop an unquenchable desire to travel to SCP-284, leaving all other concerns behind them. The desire will persist until death has eliminated the source of the stimulus.</p><p>All individuals affected by SCP-284 will express a tinge of contempt towards their native country due to an inherent fear that they may never leave SCP-284, as well as being discontent with their status as non-anomalous residents of that country.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
