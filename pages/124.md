<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-124</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-124 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at the Foundation's Site-██. SCP-124 is to be fed one (1) chicken per day.</p><p>The area surrounding SCP-124 is to be kept under constant surveillance and guarded by no less than two (2) security personnel at all times, with additional security personnel as needed. No staff or other individual is to enter SCP-124's containment chamber without express permission from a member of personnel overseeing its confinement. Any staff found trespassing in SCP-124's containment area may be detained and administered Class-A amnestics as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-124 is a heavily muscled humanoid who, despite having been unconscious for more than two (2) years, shows no signs of physical deterioration. SCP-124's body mass is currently estimated at five hundred kilograms and the individual's height, standing upright, is six (6) feet.</p><p>The skin of SCP-124's face and upper torso is covered in coarse red hair that appears to be a combination of human and native gibbon hair. The hair of SCP-124's lower torso, hands, and feet are grey and appear to have been twisted several times over the body (see photo). Despite this coarseness, SCP-124 does not appear to suffer any damage to its skin or hair except for the clear absence of nails on one hand.</p><p>SCP-124 suffers from a condition that makes it appear as if it were originally a corpse before it was "resurrected". SCP-124 appears to have normal eyelids and natural teeth; however, all of them are blackened and rotting away. The flesh itself seems unaffected by decay; however, when SCP-124 moves, stumps emerge out of both eyeballs and the exposed molars rapidly rot away into nothing. Tests show that neither decay nor mutation affects SCP-124's nervous system; while they cannot move in any direction if they cannot see, they will continue moving if they do not feel their surroundings.</p><p>SCP-124's "hair" carries with it an unknown substance that causes it to stick to anything or anyone it touches or comes into contact with (see A video log describing exactly how things stick to SCP-124 is attached as document 124-24); thus far, there has only been one case of this property affecting objects other than humans (see transcriptions enclosed in Document 124-24). Determinations are pending.</p><p>SCP-124 had been found wandering around the Empire State Building on ██/██/2014 after [DATA EXPUNGED]. When personnel attempted to move him from his containment area he became agitated and began crying loudly very similar to a gibbon animal; then abruptly collapsed dead on the floor. This suggests some connection between SCP-124 and its physiology.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
