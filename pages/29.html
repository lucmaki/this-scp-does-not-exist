<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-29</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-29 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. All outfits worn by SCP-29 are to be confiscated upon discovery, and replaced with standard uniforms. The floor of the containment cell is to be covered with a layer of sand to prevent SCP-29 from escaping.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-29 is a human female, aged 38. Its appearance is consistent with that of a normal human female from the Lower 48, with minor differences to the appearance of its hands and feet.</p><p>When in a state of depression or despair, SCP-29 will begin to cry. After about twenty minutes of crying, SCP-29 will become enraged, and within two additional hours will begin to scream for roughly six hours non-stop until it falls asleep. The agitation exhibited by SCP-29's state is extremely unusual, roughly analogous to that of an ordinary human child under the age of ten years old.</p><p>In addition, SCP-29 has a particular fascination with the phrase "goodbye Wyoming". If SCP-29 hears this phrase spoken aloud, it will become very distressed, and agitated. If echoed by another person in a similar manner (i.e., speaking the phrase as if they were leaving Wyoming), SCP-29 will become enormously excited, and rapidly attempt to accumulate as many items related to Wyoming as is possible.</p><p>After eight hours, SCP-29 will fall asleep, and establish its baseline behavior.</p><p>Within three days of exposure to the phrase "goodbye Wyoming", SCP-29 will attempt to leave its containment cell and seek out any persons who have recently left the state of Wyoming. SCP-29 does not appear to experience any fear or discomfort when attempting escape; in fact, it appears to take delight in this behavior.</p><p>SCP-29 has been moved twice due to complaints from local staff; all instances of SCP-29 move along with themselves when exposed to the phrase "goodbye Wyoming". Once every five days, SCP-29 would attempt to return to its containment cell unless restrained from doing so. In addition resulting in damage and/or destruction of surroundings; most notably, ██ caravans were burned after being hit by a falling meteorite.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
