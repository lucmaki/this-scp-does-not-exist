<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-847</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No physical barrier is to be placed between SCP-847 and any of its manifestations. Each manifestation of SCP-847 is to receive two heavily armed guards at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-847 is a sentient, interactive phenomenon existing in the state of constant flux between a number of manifestations. SCP-847 has manifested as twelve separate geometric figures corresponding to the twelve major arcana of the Tarot deck, each with a unique shape and composition.</p><p>SCP-847 typically manifests as a geometric figure composed of one or more mineralogical structures, occasionally possessing a human form. Most instances have possessed three distinct human forms, however this has not been consistent. The most recent manifestation has had only one form, resembling a short, humanoid reptillian creature with four limbs and two eyes (see Video Log 847-001).</p><p>When explicitly directed by Foundation personnel to manifest as a Hierophant card, SCP-847 will always manifest as an instance with a geometric shape in the style of its associated card. The anomalous properties of these manifestations make them highly resistant to normal forms of damage or antimagic effects; all manifestations are permanently unaffected by the aforementioned effects, even when used in large groups. Visualization methods have proven ineffective against SCP-847 manifestations, though sound waves can be used to create fracture patterns in some instances.</p><p>All known manifestations of SCP-847 possess properties typical for the associated card and will pass on its effects when physically damaged; however, SCP-847 instances are also capable of inflicting minor injuries on nearby sentient beings. This injury must be sustained while in contact with an instance; otherwise it will not affect its host and will instead pass through them without any effect. It is possible that SCP-847 may also gain intelligence through this process.</p><p>SCP-847's existence as a sentient entity creates additional anomalies:</p><p>SCP-847 is capable of absorbing any form of damage inflicted on its manifestations; currently there is no way to inflict damage on an instance of SCP-847 without it passing on this damage itself.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
