<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-813</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-813 is contained in Standard Containment ██████████. It is to be kept in a standard containment cell, with a camera installed on the ceiling facing towards its location.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-813 is a large, open room with a camera mounted on the ceiling facing at an angle towards SCP-813. If SCP-813 is not provided with power, SCP-813 will display a picture of itself and its location to any personnel who attempt to view it. Although it has been observed to change from blue to red in order to prompt this behavior, other changes have not been noticed.</p><p>When power is provided to SCP-813, it will immediately begin displaying images of people who are currently seated in front of it. This effect will continue until the power is turned off, at which point it will display the same image again.</p><p>According to Foundation records, SCP-813 was originally discovered in ████████, Japan when local municipal authorities were called to investigate reports of "people" appearing within a public park surrounded by large amounts of foliage. They found no evidence of anyone being present in the area, but cameras pointed at the location showed a different result. After further investigation, local police were alerted and they sought out SCP-813 as a potential security threat.</p><p>During initial investigation of the area surrounding SCP-813, officers entered the building and discovered several people inside while they were investigating the anomaly. All subjects required sedation after contact with them was made; however, all claims that they were present before entering the property were proven false by Foundation teams sent to collect them. An agreement was reached between Foundation and local authorities stating that all residents were amnesticized and returned to their homes with no knowledge of what transpired at SCP-813.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
