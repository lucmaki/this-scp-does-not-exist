<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-919</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-919 is to be held in a Secure Containment Locker at Site-██. It is to be kept separate from any type of media or writing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-919 is a black leather-bound book. It has an embossed title in gold letters on the spine: The Book of Life. The text of the book is written entirely in Sanskrit, but the body of the text has been translated using modern technical equipment. The text within it states that those who read it will be granted one wish each day for the rest of their lives.</p><p>The first page of SCP-919 seems to be a blank piece of paper with a number written in ink at the top right corner, 1/1. Below this number is written "Maya vidya karuna novini."</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
