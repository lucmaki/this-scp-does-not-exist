<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-22</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-22 is currently contained at Site 34, a facility inaccessible by land. By all means, discourage the use of SCP-22 by civilians.</p><p>Information about SCP-22 must be classified as "restricted", and access to that information is granted only to Level 4 personnel with a level of clearance appropriate for the level of information in question. Subjects who are taking medication with an effect similar to amnestics should be given the usual clearance requirements, but not all medications have the same side effects or intensity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-22 is a device resembling a small computerized pocket calculator. It takes the form of a black plastic handle, approximately three and a half inches long, with a dial on top and a set of buttons along one side. SCP-22 weighs fifty nine grams and is equipped with a three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope for basic orientation. The main input mechanism is light detection, with an infrared attachment built into the back. SCP-22 functions as a functional calculator; however, it will not function properly in any application that requires more than basic arithmetic using pencil and paper.</p><p>Subjects who use SCP-22 to function as calculators will have their math skills affected in the same way as if they had been using SCP-22 for its original purpose. Subjects usually lose all ability to perform arithmetic operations involving simple integers, and will invariably perform incorrect calculations unless the subject is made aware that they are performing such calculations by another human being or some other external source.</p><p>Addition of higher numbers beyond the first is unaffected by the effect: when a subject learns how to add two three-digit numbers, they will be unable to perform the calculation when asked to do so on paper or into their phone's calculator application, but they can still perform the calculation in their head while holding SCP-22 in a loop around their finger. For example, 597 × 7 equals 4111, but 2403 = [5+9+1]×7(2)</p><p>Example: -████-, performing addition mentally</p><p>⇐ + 3 + []2 + []3 + 4[]4 + [5+6+[]6]7 × ╚ ╚ ╚ ╚ೣೣೣೣೣೣೣೣೣೣ2[2][2][2][2][2][3/4]1561/178822276833233334567890123485587654321= 5328246508465384444444444444444444444444445 ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ If only we could add like she did! ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ</p><p>Addition can be performed mentally as long as fingers remain on SCP-22's keys.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
