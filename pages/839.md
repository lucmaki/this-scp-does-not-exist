<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-839</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-839 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, one size larger than its original containment cell. The interior of the cell is to be lined with 829 copies of "The New Labour Standards", and any further copies, printed or electronic, are to be destroyed on sight. SCP-839 is to be periodically injected with an antibiotic and given live-in caregivers 24/7 for observation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-839 appears to be a normal male Caucasian human, aged 37 years and 171 centimeters tall. SCP-839 is otherwise healthy, and has been given no unusual medical treatment or therapy. However, after the first year in containment, SCP-839 underwent a remarkable physical change. This was marked primarily by an approximately 100% increase in muscle mass, along with slight alterations in hair type, skin tone and distribution of body hair. After the change, SCP-839 had difficulty walking, as his bones and joints were not accustomed to the increased weight of his muscles; however he was able to walk normally despite this.</p><p>Following this growth, beyond one year of containment SCP-839 displayed very few outward signs of aging. The changes in height stopped at about 162 inches (4 meters), and skin color remained light even after two years of additional growth; hair color also did not change significantly. Upon reaching 3 years of containment SCP-839 continued to grow more rapidly until reaching its current height of 5 meters.</p><p>SCP-839 displays no anomalous effects following these changes other than its apparent youthfulness (which increases with time). Despite the physiological changes of SCP-839's body, no anomalous properties have been detected other than those listed above.</p><p>SCP-839 was not initially hostile or dangerous towards Foundation personnel and has been cooperative to date; however it has shown interest in books on human biology. Cadavers have been produced for testing purposes but are immediately incinerated upon discovery by SCP personnel. Class E staff are to undergo regular psychiatric checks before entering SCP-839's containment chamber due to the mental stress caused by its sudden increasing size over time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
