<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-948</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid-K</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-948 is kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. Any potential sources of SCP-948 are to be quarantined and immediately incinerated.</p><p>SCP-948 is kept in a secure, immovable container within its containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-948 is a black, metal switch with a round cap. SCP-948 appears to be based on Japanese era switches used in factories to produce various products.</p><p>SCP-948's anomalous nature activates when an object is held within the reach of SCP-948 for approximately 60 seconds. Upon activation, SCP-948 simultaneously and instantaneously strikes any objects that are nearby, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>SCP-948 deactivates when an object is removed from its range. If the object is not handled by anyone other than SCP-948 itself, it will return to its ordinary state once left unattended.</p><p>SCP-948 was recovered during a raid on a factory located ██████, Japan. SCP-948 was found when agents entered the warehouse where SCP-948 was stored and noticed what appeared to be a switch being pressed against [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
