<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-154</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-154 is contained at Site-77. A specialized containment vehicle has been constructed for the transfer of SCP-154 and must be used exclusively for transporting SCP-154. The vehicle should be equipped with several steel plates to prevent breaching, and a small surveillance camera mounted on the roof to monitor the interior of the vehicle.</p><p>The vehicle will be kept under constant surveillance inside and outside the facility at all times to prevent unauthorized access. All personnel not assigned to SCP-154 transport will be kept in a nearby building monitored after hours by security personnel. Only Class D personnel are permitted to handle SCP-154.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-154 is a suburban American house, located in [REDACTED]. It has been determined through experimentation that while SCP-154 is contained at Site-77, the area surrounding it remains relatively unaffected by SCP-154. Of note: trees near the house remain untouched, despite the branches being completely stripped of leaves and wood.</p><p>SCP-154 is currently under investigation for possible properties inconsistent with its current classification. Foundation personnel are not permitted to investigate any other properties of SCP-154.</p><p>SCP-154 was originally brought to the Foundation's attention when autopsy reports for several individuals were found to be identical, with only a small variation in the dates of death. Investigation found that these individuals had died during a single night in [REDACTED]. The bodies were destroyed after they had expired, but investigators discovered that the victims had been stripped down to their undergarments before death. This led to an investigation into SCP-154's properties.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
