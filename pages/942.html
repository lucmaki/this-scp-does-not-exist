<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-942</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-942 is to be stored in a steel container within Site-██'s Safe SCP Object Wing. Any personnel who wish to experience SCP-942 are to wear full body protection, and have their hands sterilized prior to the experiment through a decontamination procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-942 is an octahedron with a height of 10 cm, width of 7 cm, and depth of 2 cm. The sides of SCP-942 appear to be made of some type of glassy substance, though the exact composition is unknown.</p><p>When any object other than another SCP-942 object is placed inside SCP-942, it will transform into some form of polyhedral solid material. So far, this has only been observed in the shape of a cube or octahedron; however, the polyhedral objects created by SCP-942 are suspected to have a wider variation in shape and size than normal polyhedral solids. If placed into an environment compromised by heat or strong gravity for a prolonged period of time, the polyhedral material will undergo sharp changes in shape and appearance until it has become more conducive to survival.</p><p>SCP-942 was recovered from ██████ after several persons began having hallucinations of being inside a large structure resembling a geodesic dome. The structure revealed itself to be the interior of SCP-942 after one person began attempting to remove the cover from SCP-942. The cover was locked onto the object using unknown mechanical means. After removing the cover, all persons felt themselves [DATA EXPUNGED]. When removed from SCP-942, they all reported feeling extremely fatigued as if they had been running up a very long flight of stairs.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
