<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-122</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The perimeter of SCP-122 is to be monitored with auditory stimuli. Personnel are to respond if they detect an interaction with the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-122 is a class D object. The perimeter of the object has been measured to occupy roughly 2 square kilometres, but no clear boundary can be discerned.</p><p>SCP-122 is not affected by gravity and is able to generate sounds of varying intensity and volume throughout the area. These sounds do not exist in any time or space outside of the perimeter of SCP-122, but are capable of being heard by human subjects inside the perimeter at extremely high volumes with little warning.</p><p>When an individual in contact with SCP-122 hears a sound, they will hear all of those sounds simultaneously in their head with no ability to distinguish individual frequencies produced by mechanical devices such as speakers or recordings, although they are capable of distinguishing notes if they are knowledgeable about music composition.</p><p>Individuals who have experienced this effect have reported feeling dizzy and nauseous after when it subsides, presumably from having taken in too much information for their body to process. Additionally, due to the lack of variation in the sounds produced by SCP-122, individuals typically experience difficulty sleeping once they are removed from the psychological effects of having been within its sphere.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
