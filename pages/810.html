<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-810</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-810 is to be kept in a storage locker, to prevent access by unauthorized personnel. At no time should it be brought outside of the facility; any individuals found to have done so are to be detained and questioned regarding their activities. SCP-810 has been rated as single-mode, meaning it is safe to handle at all times.</p><p>Employees who have been exposed to SCP-810 (including those exposed inside out) are required to submit a handwritten log concerning their exposure and health for two weeks after exposure. The logs are to be submitted quarterly. Additionally, all affected employees are required to attend therapy sessions with a psychiatrist following their release from Foundation custody.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-810 resembles a sepia-toned photograph. Its front face appears to be worn and dented, while the back and sides appear to have several small tears on the edges, especially on the left side. SCP-810's surface is mildly acidic when tested in solution, though no defined rate of increase is known. The frontal portion of SCP-810 appears to comprise an image of a [REDACTED] person (see Addendum 810-1).</p><p>SCP-810's anomalous properties only take effect when one views it with their bare eyes, or through a pair of stereoscopic 3D glasses. When viewed through any other types of optical devices, 438.9°F (205°C) is seen as a picture of some type of [REDACTED]. This effect does not occur in normal conditions.</p><p>Teaching personnel are required to bring opaque sunglasses for use when teaching students about SCP-810.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
