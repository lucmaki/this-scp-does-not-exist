<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-459</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-459 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Containment chamber is to be cleaned daily, and monitors must be maintained on it at all times, with particular attention paid to SCP-459's breathing and blood pressure. All personnel involved in the care of SCP-459 are required to wear full-body protection, including gloves and masks, at all times.</p><p>Should all precautions be breached, or SCP-459's health indicate an imminent threat, it is to be terminated via cardiac arrest procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-459 is a dead human male, aged approximately 40 to 50 years, with a height of 1.75 meters and a weight of 77 kilograms. It has been described as being emaciated and covered in numerous tattoos and scarring. The head has been replaced by an artificial cranial plate and several implants; however, these are not sufficiently sophisticated to provide the brain with normal functions.</p><p>SCP-459 was buried in the ██████ County Morgue on █/█/2009, but was unearthed 24 hours later by Officer ██████ following reports of foul odors in the morgue basement. Upon removal from its grave, SCP-459 showed signs of life for about 5 minutes before expiring for no reason. Following this incident and uncovering other anomalous phenomenon under the morgue, SCP-459 was transferred to Foundation containment.</p><p>When questioned about his name and identity, SCP-459 has revealed that it does not belong anywhere on Earth, but identifies itself as "████████ ████████". Attempts to learn more information from SCP-459 have always failed in regards to this subject. SCP-459 claims to be between 168 and 189 years old, has no known relatives or identification papers, shows no memory of its past life and possesses little knowledge of modern technology or sciences.</p><p>SCP-459 had appeared within the containment facility several times during its initial testing period, but at no time did it cause any danger or affect the inner workings of the facility in any way.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
