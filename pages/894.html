<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-894</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-894 is to be kept in a climate controlled chamber with dim lighting until it has reached maturity, after which time it is to be moved back into the same chamber. The chamber must have a clear view of any incoming airspace into the Foundation's containment area.</p><p>SCP-894 is to be fed once per day. Any spilled or wasted food is to be removed from the containment area and incinerated using standard pyrotechnic techniques.</p><p>When SCP-894 becomes adult, it may be released from the containment area for up to two hours of flight time each day. This release may only occur in an open hangar at Site-19.</p><p>Afterward, SCP-894 must be returned back into its containment area. Any attempt by SCP-894 to exit the containment area without authorization will result in termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-894 is a moth of the genus Heliothis, commonly called a "ladybug." It is approximately ten centimeters long, with a wingspan of close to twenty centimeters. SCP-894 has wide wings with a primary coloration resembling that of the Japanese Cherry Blossom.</p><p>SCP-894 is docile and nervous, and remains sedentary unless startled or threatened in any way. SCP-894 shows no interest in leaving its containment area, saying it is unable to do so and will not attempt to do so until it is adult. It is currently believed that SCP-894 either cannot or chooses not to leave its cell due to its lack of wings.</p><p>SCP-894 generates a strong electrical charge through its wings. This can be sensed by any person within about six meters of the moth at all times. When SCP-894 exerts itself, the charge will also flow through other forms of matter nearby, such as concrete floors, cinderblocks, and even persons themselves.</p><p>While SCP-894 hovers in place, it will make loud ticking noises from its wings and abdomen. While this occurs, it shows signs of discomfort and agitation.</p><p>When friendly individuals come into direct contact with SCP-894, they will feel a pleasurable sensation for several seconds before being paralyzed for exactly three minutes by the electrical charge running through their bodies. This paralysis does not affect their limbs. After this happens once or twice, they will enter an altered state of consciousness while helplessly moving along with SCP-894's flight path into an uncharted location designated Site-19. In these cases, information suggesting that Site-19 is near the location where they normally reside will appear on the surfaces they access; any attempts to remove the information by their homes have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
