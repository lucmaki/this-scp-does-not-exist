<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-460</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-460 is kept in a standard Containment Locker at Site-05. Its location has not changed since its recovery in 1984. A large number of security cameras are adjacent to the locker, to monitor the object in case of an unauthorized opening. The area around SCP-460 should be considered an active and dangerous crime scene.</p><p>All personnel assigned to research work at Site-05 are to be thoroughly screened for SCP-460-related knowledge and signed off on as safe before being allowed access. Should SCP-460's emotional state change without prior warning, all unauthorized access must be denied until a period of at least three hours has passed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-460 is a humanoid being of black coloration, 1.98 meters in height, and weighing 64.2 kilograms. The object displays no apparent motor or cognitive functions other as to appear as an ordinary human male. SCP-460 also appears to have an unusually high amount of nerve endings, with over twice the density of what would be expected for its size.</p><p>SCP-460 possesses several anomalous properties:</p><p>SCP-460's appearance changes with its emotional state. When calm, it displays a youthful appearance; upon heightened anger or fear, it will distort and become multi-colored, before returning to its original coloration upon deactivation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
