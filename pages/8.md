<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8 is to be kept in its original location inside a climate-controlled vault at Site ██. At all times, the interior of SCP-8's containment area is to be lit with several light sources that have been specially shielded from exposure to direct sunlight. In addition, high-quality (but relatively inexpensive) photosensitive film must always be available for exposure to SCP-8's effects.</p><p>SCP-8 must not be moved from its original location or removed from the climate-controlled vault. Removal from the climate-controlled vault requires Level 4 Clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8 is a 20 cm diameter sphere of polished nickel formed from ore with approximately minuscule amounts of uranium and thorium. While the mass of SCP-8 is unimportant compared to that of other metallic substances, the value of its specific atomic composition amazes all scientists who have examined it.</p><p>SCP-8 exhibits several anomalous effects in correlation with its atomic composition, most notably:</p><p>SCP-8 was first discovered in [REDACTED] after an investigation into a theft from a local college's physics club led agents to an abandoned warehouse. It was immediately classified as Safe, and placed in Foundation control.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
