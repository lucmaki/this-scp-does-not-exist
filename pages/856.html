<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-856</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-856 is to be kept in a standard Safe Object cell at Site 19. The flooring must not be removed and no attempt is to be made to uncover the structure beneath. Personnel are not to enter SCP-856 without authorization from on-site security staff.</p><p>All personnel entering SCP-856 must wear full protective clothing, including respirators. Personnel are forbidden from removing portions of their clothing, or attempting to take photographs or drawings of SCP-856 without prior approval.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-856 is an above-ground section of a ruined medieval building measuring approximately 20 meters in length, which appears to have been constructed from wood and stone. The majority of the original structure has been removed or otherwise damaged, with additional damage caused by burrowing creatures at some points.</p><p>SCP-856's anomalous properties are triggered when any living organism other than SCP-856 is present within it. When this occurs, SCP-856 will revert to its original appearance, as well as emit a high-pitched shriek for 1-5 seconds. SCP-856 demonstrates an anomalous resistance to the passage of time during this period, with any changes taking place once SCP-856 has returned to its previous appearance.</p><p>If any living organism remains in SCP-856 after the shriek has stopped, they will be compelled to attempt to exit it via any openings that remain. In all cases, such attempts will result in violent spasms and attempted retching before death. Foundation personnel inside SCP-856 report similar reactions when exiting it.</p><p>The methods used by SCP-856 to induce this effect appear to be highly variable depending on the circumstances surrounding its creation and subsequent existence as a Safe Object. Very few specimens have been encountered and when one was recently discovered in its original location many Foundation members lost their lives trying to escape it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
