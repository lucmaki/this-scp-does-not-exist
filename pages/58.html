<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-58</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-58 is to be kept in a standard storage locker, outfitted with humidification and built in water supply. Upon acquisition, SCP-58 is to be thoroughly researched for its appropriate containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-58 is a variety of ale brewed with SCP-707. SCP-58 has the consistency of normal beer and tastes indistinguishable from it, but contains hallucinogenic properties when consumed. Consumption removes the effects of SCP-707, leaving SCP-58 entirely tasteless, though prolonged exposure results in dizziness and nausea.</p><p>The beer became known as "Mr Fox Publish" after an incident where an investigator mistook the name for the result of a digital bar code reader for that of a pub crawl. Almost immediately upon consumption, an image of a fox appeared on the label. When asked about this, an employee responded that Mr Fox Publish was a typeface created by a previous owner, who had since passed away. Upon further questioning, employees revealed no ownership records and that they intended to replace it with another font once a replacement could be found.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
