<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-668</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area in which SCP-668 is contained has been impounded. No additional containment measures are required at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-668 is an average-sized house located on the outskirts of ███████, Norway. SCP-668 appears to have been abandoned at some point; there is no furniture or household goods present in the structure, and a large amount of domestic excrement (including what appears to be a pet dog) has accumulated on the floors and walls.</p><p>When one enters SCP-668, it becomes apparent that the entire building is inhabited by a single person. The occupant(s) do not make any attempt to leave during observation, and instead continuously emit low-level noises such as whispering and sniffing. The occupant(s) do not appear to be aware of observers; when asked direct questions, the occupant(s) will show no signs of awareness of their surroundings or presence.</p><p>SCP-668 can only be entered once every month, and only with permission from or at the request of one individual who has remained in residence for an extended amount of time at least three years prior. Despite normal human lifespan being around 80 years, occupants of SCP-668 consistently report feeling "old". This can vary from 3 weeks to 5 months between occupants.</p><p>Inhabitants state that entering/exiting SCP-668 feels significantly different than leaving its confines. Many report apathy during their short departures, though they are able to provide detailed descriptions of what they experienced while they were present in SCP-668. Several researchers who have attempted to leave SCP-668 report feelings of euphoria and general well being while remaining within its boundaries; however, none have stayed longer than 5 days inside SCP-668 before attempting to leave again.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
