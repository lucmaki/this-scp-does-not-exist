<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-324</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-324 is to be kept in a containment chamber at Site-55. A constant state of high temperature and humidity is to be maintained within the chamber, keeping SCP-324 at 100% humidity. Diameter of the chamber must be kept at a maximum of 2 meters for all testing. Due to the nature of its effect, SCP-324 must be kept away from any type of instrumentation or electronics. Any personnel entering the chamber must wear gas masks and protective gear at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-324 is an electronically detachable, human-shaped object composed of a thick, bluish, vaporous gas. SCP-324 moves in a manner similar to that of a dancing humanoid, with its arms swinging in and out with all five fingers spread out at all times. SCP-324 emits no sound from its movement and appears to have no eyes or discernible facial features. The only visible feature is the red appendage protruding from the back, just above the buttocks. Upon being removed from its containment chamber, SCP-324 begins to rapidly produce a low level hum if placed within 5 meters of an electronic device. Once removed from the device, SCP-324's humming stops and it resumes normal behavior until reentering it.</p><p>SCP-324 exhibits a slight resistance to gravity when moving around the room and seems to prefer standing close to walls. When carrying an electronic device within 10 meters of itself, SCP-324 will begin staring at the device intently. If the item is removed from the radius of approximately 3 meters while this is going on, SCP-324 will then begin dancing in attempt to regain it. It is currently unknown why it reacts this way and further testing is required to confirm this theory.</p><p>Each time a test subject interacts with SCP-324 for less than 60 seconds, they will be "infected" by it as follows:</p><p>After 60 seconds, the subject will begin to experience signs of fever. For the next 24 hours, the subject will become increasingly more agitated and mentally unstable. Over the course of 15 to 20 days, the subject will begin to exhibit symptoms usually associated with schizophrenia. After approximately 1 month, the subject will begin to believe that SCP-324 is a sentient entity and will attempt to communicate with it. After 1 month, the subject will begin to refuse treatment and will die of dehydration.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
