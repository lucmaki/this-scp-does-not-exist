<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-654</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-654 is currently contained in an isolated area of a large coastal national park, approximately 250 km from the nearest city. Large quantities of low income housing units have been demolished and cleared away from the area, and possibly replaced with new structures. SCP-654 is to be protected by a 5 km radius around its location at all times, and any trespassers are to be apprehended immediately by security personnel.</p><p>Due to excessive losses of life due to SCP-654's effect, it is strongly recommended that civilians not enter the area within the containment perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-654 is a large, irregularly-shaped block of Portland cement with a well-defined circular perimeter. Within the perimeter is an area in which Earth has been removed, providing a clear path around the object. The effect of SCP-654 originates from within this 'void' area and cannot be seen on a scale greater than 1 m unless the person viewing is at least 10 m away. It is theorized that SCP-654 was originally used to build roads around the perimeter, although there is no concrete evidence supporting this theory.</p><p>When an individual enters SCP-654's containment zone and approaches very close to the center of its surface, they will suddenly begin to feel as if they are moving at high speeds through the ground. While this feeling can be brought up to approximately 80 km per hour, outside of SCP-654's containment zone, individuals who approach it at this speed experience nothing out of the ordinary. It is currently unknown exactly how long subjects will remain in their motionless state after entering SCP-654; records show that some subjects have remained motionless for periods exceeding two weeks.</p><p>Subjects who are within 20 m of the center of SCP-654's surface when this occurs begin to suffer from extreme visual disorientation and dizziness, often suffering from fainting spells and nausea. Particularly susceptible subjects may vomit frequently during this time, while violent physical reactions such as convulsions become more common as dosage increases. Subjects exposed to the side effects of SCP-654 will recover completely upon leaving SCP-654's containment zone or if removed from their sight. If a subject remains within SCP-654's containment zone after having entered it, they will begin to lose consciousness.</p><p>The exact formula for SCP-650's effect is not yet known; however, current research suggests that it is caused by Portland cement and/or silica sand containing trace amounts of sodium chlorate or sodium bicarbonate being mixed with water (maximum pH 6). Further research into these substances has been curtailed due to lack of funding.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
