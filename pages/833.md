<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-833</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-833 is to be contained in a standard containment facility with a room dedicated solely to its containment. This area should be kept as free of direct sunlight and as dark as possible while still allowing for normal activity. Personnel entering and exiting SCP-833 are to wear full body suits and protective goggles if the chemical in question is corrosive or non-toxic. Full coveralls and respirators are to be worn if the chemical in question is hazardous or toxic.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-833 is a boombox. It has been observed to play several songs, each of which are played over and over again without any set order. When not playing music, SCP-833 appears to be in a dormant state with no anomalous effect.</p><p>Music will only play if:</p><p>If the scenario above is not met with success, SCP-833 will play its first song of the day as normal. On two separate occasions, SCP-833 played the same songs back-to-back with an additional album playing in between.</p><p>Only one song has ever affected subjects differently: "The Power", by Master P and Craig Mack (album titled "Ghetto Story"). The song is particularly unnerving because it is usually played very slowly. However, when the song was played at a high pitch and volume, subjects have reported feeling a sensation similar to dizziness and nausea. This dose was below lethal levels so no serious injuries have been reported from this event.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
