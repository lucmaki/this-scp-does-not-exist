<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-767</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-767 is located in a secure containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel entering the chamber must be screened and cleared by the onsite fire department before they enter the chamber.</p><p>Only one room must be occupied at any given time. At this time, SCP-767 has been inactive for several months due to lack of funding, and all personnel are to refrain from entering the room until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-767 is an industrial garbage disposal unit. SCP-767 was originally ██████ Corporation, and is now ███████. The unit appears to have been inactive for approximately 150 years, as well as being exposed to non-human skin contact.</p><p>SCP-767 is described as a coffin of sorts, with a large metal compartment on the bottom. In this compartment is a piece of sulfuric acid weighing roughly 1 kg, which exhibits zero anomalous properties when tested.</p><p>SCP-767's anomalous effects manifest when a labeled plastic bag filled with extraneous matter is placed upon the unit's plate. When this happens, what appears to be [DATA EXPUNGED]. The sound of SCP-767's motor can be heard at all times, and experiments on the speed at which it operates have shown that SCP-767 moves at 60 km/h in any direction.</p><p>SCP-767's effect always takes place somewhere within 100 km of its physical location when activated. However, if no one is in a room and SCP-767 activates, it will proceed to move towards the nearest human inhabitant, regardless of the distance to them (this has not been observed in instances where SCP-767 activates through non-custodial means). Since the containment chamber has been equipped with motion sensors, and no humans are currently present in it, no further anomaly has been observed from this method of activation.</p><p>The only known way to prevent SCP-768 from appearing is for mortals to not be present in the vicinity of SCP-768 when it activates.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
