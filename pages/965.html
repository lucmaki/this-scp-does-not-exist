<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-965</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-965 is contained within a series of underwater caverns which have been outfitted with state-of-the-art acoustic deterrent technology. SCP-965 is not to be approached by personnel unless absolutely necessary; any personnel who does so will be terminated on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-965 is a species of eagle, approximately 5m long, with an average wingspan of 9.4m. Its plumage is primarily white and black with subtle red markings; it possesses sharp talons, and its beak is equipped with a pair of large, serrated "fangs". SCP-965 was first observed in ████████, ██████ sometime in the early 19██; since that time, it has been sighted on numerous occasions in various locations around the world.</p><p>SCP-965 appears to be able to see any human being who enters the vicinity of its nest, regardless of the level of light or darkness in which that person is found. This effect occurs whether or not the individual is aware of SCP-965. Furthermore, SCP-965 often attacks trespassers before they have had sufficient time to perceive its presence.</p><p>SCP-965 seems completely incapable of flight; however, it can move almost instantaneously from one place to another at speeds which have not been measured. SCP-965 has been known to attack personnel with its talons while they are still in midair, causing them to plummet hundreds of meters into the depths below.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
