<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-740</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-740 is to be monitored via surveillance cameras and GPS trackers at all times, with no fewer than 10 personnel assigned to this task. SCP-740 must be kept within a containment unit at least three (3) meters in diameter and equivalent in mass, constructed of neutronium or some other dense material. The interior surface of the containment unit must have an opening measuring no less than one hundred (100) centimeters in diameter. At all times, the exterior surface must have an area of one square meter (1 m x 1 m).</p><p>The containment unit must be situated within an area free from any forms of electromagnetic interference. The unit is equipped with a backup generator capable of sustaining the unit's current electrical usage for up to three (3) days and a battery array capable of sustaining the unit's current energy usage for up to three (3) years.</p><p>No personnel are to enter the containment unit without express permission from Dr. ████████. Should either event occur, all Foundation personnel operating in the vicinity are ordered to lock down all electronic communications systems within seventy (70) kilometers of SCP-740 and report the incident to Site-19.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-740, designated SCP-740-1 and designated "Progress Toward Equality" by Dr. ████████, is an irregular, orb-shaped object between two and three meters in diameter with a dark brown metallic exterior surface. SCP-740's mass is unknown as it has demonstrated no signs of natural decay; however, its gravitation field has proved impossible to measure.</p><p>While equipped with all of the usual equipment required for operation, SCP-740 is capable of performing a variety of anomalous acts upon either itself or another object currently occupying its containment unit, and varies depending on the subject targeted. This behavior does not appear to be controlled by any means from the outside; rather, SCP-740 appears to instantaneously make all necessary calculations in order to achieve the desired effect (test logs are provided below).</p><p>By designating an area within the containment unit as an "idling zone", SCP-740 is able to alter the gravitational constant within the zone to restore kinetic energy to objects placed within it. However, this process consumes at least one twenty-third (⅕) of the available energy of whatever object at which it operates. The effect remains in effect even if the object is removed from the idling zone; therefore, any object that cannot sustainably operate during this process is deactivated and stored in storage until it can be reactivated.</p><p>SCP-740 was recovered following a sighting of a small ragtag group known as "The Anonymous Collective" along with several other Foundation personnel and civilian witnesses at Site-19. Information gathered from video footage retrieved from surveillance cameras located around Site-19 depicted SCP-740 attempting to assimilate several pieces of technology owned by Foundation personnel using a variety of anomalous effects. The entirety of these events were halted after evidence was found linking them to entities previously unknown to Foundation records.</p><p>At present, SCP-740 remains operational but is recorded as having been inactive for eight (8) days due to lack of power for the backup generator for the containment unit's solar array; however, no measurable changes have occurred since its last activation. As such, SCP-740 continues to display anomalous behavior.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
