<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-664</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-664 is contained in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell at Site 49 due to its unique destructive capabilities. The level of security around the object is classified as Alpha-Level Clearance/Access Only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-664 is a humanoid in the form of an elderly Japanese male, approximately 1.95 meters tall. SCP-664 displays no anomalous properties other than its enhanced reproductive capabilities among females. It has been identified as "Mr. Nakamura".</p><p>It was originally sighted on February 3rd, 1989 at ██████ [REDACTED] in Osaka by Agent Jack Moriarty, who noticed SCP-664's unusual reproductive rate and detained it with the intention of learning its origin and containment methods. However, the entire area was destroyed due to SCP-664's anomalous destructive capabilities.</p><p>SCP-664 is able to reproduce via: (a) sexual intercourse between any two humans; (b) drinking a large quantity of water; (c) entering into an environment with a large population of animals, most notably cats and dogs; or (d) touching an object made of glass. SCP-664 will attempt to take away the subject's life force while doing so.</p><p>The purpose of SCP-664 lies in its superhuman ability to produce water vapor from a body and expel it anywhere in the vicinity by using air pressure beneath its skin. This causes severe damage to all body tissues in a wide range of localities including bone, muscle, nerves, bone marrow, etc. If the subject is damaged to a point where it can no longer produce enough water vapor for SCP-664, it will consume the subject's water reserves regardless of whether they are inside or outside of their body.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
