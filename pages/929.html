<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-929</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-929 is to be kept in a large (20 m x 20 m) testing chamber at Site-██. This chamber has been constructed with an airlock to prevent accidental exposure of the contents. No personnel are to be permitted in this chamber except designated Class-D personnel, who are to wear a SCUBA suit and remain tethered while within the chamber.</p><p>All SCP-929 specimens found outside of the subject's containment area are to be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-929 is a sealed 1.2 m x 2.6 m x 3 m steel tank located in the testing chamber of Site-██, containing a human cadaver, designated SCP-929-9 ("Subject 929") sealed within. Biological samples extracted from the corpse show that it has died of radiation poisoning, with the user of SCP-929 deliberately irradiating it. All similar tanks were destroyed, and all records regarding their construction have been purged.</p><p>The occupant of SCP-929 will move its head to look outside at any point during the day, and remains motionless until nightfall when it resumes moving. No other changes in bodily function or mental state are noted, suggesting the effects are purely psychological. At nightfall, the subject's arms extend towards walls or objects in order to reach them, though they will remain stationary if there is no object within reach.</p><p>When an object is brought within range of SCP-929, the occupant will grasp it and begin to pull itself towards it, even climbing obstacles within its path if necessary. If an obstacle prevents the subject from reaching a particular area, such as a wall or floor, then it will simply cling to the surface and attempt to braid itself into strands until it can reach its destination. After some time spent pulling at objects, SCP-929 will let go and "swim" towards its destination using its arms, which are apparently able to extrude through the surrounding material. The extruded appendages are covered by skin that is translucent and stretchable; it is possible to see through them while they are not soft enough for manipulation or movement.</p><p>SCP-929 has been found capable of opening hundreds of meters-long tunnels on occasion through solid walls and ceilings. It is unknown how long these tunnels last due to their unpredictable nature; however, when outside exploration is possible (when daytime hours occur), tunnels will often be found that run between three or more buildings that are miles apart when opened; this distance may be closer to 20 m or further than 50 m between points depending on terrain and weather conditions. The length of these tunnels does not seem to be dependent on whether or not creatures such as rats are present within them.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
