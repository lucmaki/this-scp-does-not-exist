<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-994</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe-upgraded</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All active instances of SCP-994 are stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The vault containing SCP-994 is to be kept under video surveillance at all times. Any personnel authorized to access the vault must wear full body armor and any other necessary protection. All instances of SCP-994 must be kept fully nourished and watered at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-994 is a series of thirteen identical humanoids, each 3 meters in height. The number of individual instances of SCP-994 is currently unknown, although all are connected to the next instance by a thin strand of DNA.</p><p>SCP-994 instances possess a 'group sign' that gives away their true nature. This sign is in the shape of a stylized pyramid with a single point at the top, and is located on the chest between the pectoral muscles. Any human subject attempting to mimic the group sign will immediately be identified as an instance of SCP-994.</p><p>SCP-994 is able to talk normally and can perform basic physical acts such as walking, sitting, eating, etcetera. They have been observed to have a strong sense of camaraderie, and will generally try to keep company with any other subjects who attempt to mimic the group sign.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
