<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-656</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to monitor SCP-656's location and communicate with municipal authorities regarding the removal of SCP-656. SCP-656's removal rate is to be increased to 5 kilograms per month.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-656 is the collective designation for all waste bags belonging to a company in █████, Australia. SCP-656 instances have shown no correlation in production or distribution whatsoever. The nature of SCP-656's anomalous properties manifest after specimens are removed from the bag.</p><p>After being unzipped and unfolded, subjects stored within SCP-656 will exhibit a healthy and normal looking human brain, in a very small space, with their spinal cord extending from their back to their head. Subjects will usually be conscious and able to communicate verbally when permitted access to writing utensils or computers. On occasion, subjects may not be conscious due to increased inflammation of their central nervous system.</p><p>SCP-656 was first discovered after ██████ City Council workers noticed an unusually high number of residents reporting minor neurological symptoms outside local stores and businesses. Attempts were made to remove SCP-656 from nearby stores, only for attempts to fail as more instances emerged within their vicinity. After the loss of ██ Foundation personnel, classified jurisdiction was investigated by Foundation forces and a containment breach was prevented. At this time, the Foundation has taken over investigation and containment of SCP-656. Further details on current containment procedures are available in Document 656-1.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
