<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-15</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> </p><p></p><p>All instances of SCP-15 are to be kept in Class III lockers at Site-73. In the event that an instance of SCP-15 damages its storage locker, it is to be confiscated by security and disposed of.</p><p>In addition to its containment procedures, SCP-15 has been assigned the standard disinformation protection procedures. It is currently the object under the most scrutiny for an apparent link with a number of missing persons cases, as well as unsolved crimes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-15 is a set of six necklaces, each of which comprises a single pendant depicting a clock face with the number "6" inside it. It is unknown where SCP-15 came from or why it was created, but researchers have been unable to find any evidence in the official records regarding its existence.</p><p>SCP-15's anomalous properties manifest when an individual wearing it attempts to engage in a criminal act. Upon this point, several events will occur simultaneously: the person pursuing their victim will receive several contradictory reports from different sources, there will be several eyewitnesses to their actions (however, none will describe them accurately), and these eyewitness accounts in turn will contradict each other. The effect of these changes is such that only five minutes of time elapse between the moment when the event occurs and when it is reported. For example, if an individual attempts to steal a book from a library and fails, they will be arrested shortly thereafter. This delay is caused by time manipulation as well as the fact that no one remembers exactly what happened during that short period of time except the participants themselves.</p><p>SCP-15's effects do not extend beyond the individual wearing it; objects and people outside of direct observation are unaffected. The only exception to this rule is SCP-15 itself, whose effects are extended to any individual who touches it or even comes close to it. SCP-15 is so valuable for this unusual property that its price tag varies between $100 and $10,000 depending on its current exchange rate with its original currency.</p><p>When SCP-15 was first discovered several months ago, rumors started circulating about how something similar had happened to many tourists in Paris, France back in 1970. After further investigation and research into all relevant data relating to SCP-15's history, researchers concluded that no such event had occurred anywhere in the world at the time of SCP-15's creation. All witnesses interviewed were adamant about testifying that no such incident had taken place; however, despite surviving the effects of SCP-15 over decades they have never been able to provide any useful information regarding their own experiences.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
