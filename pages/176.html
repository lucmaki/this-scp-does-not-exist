<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-176</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe-Site</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-176 is to be monitored and guarded by on-site security personnel. No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-176 without approval of Site-██ command authority.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-176 is a containment chamber comprised of five separate rooms. Each room contains a chair, a desk, and a chalkboard with a message scrawled on it in black ink. The messages vary from room to room since each is written by an individual.</p><p>The contents of the messages range from threats of violence towards the personnel inside SCP-176 to pleas for help. When no more subjects are available for testing, the message on SCP-176 will change to reflect subject’s current mood and feeling about the experience.</p><p>When subjects enter SCP-176, they will find their designated classroom within the facility. However, all equipment used inside SCP-176 will be in disarray, as if they had not been used even once before.</p><p>SCP-176 was discovered when several staff members reported experiencing similar phenomena while working late at night at Site-██. Investigation revealed that SCP-176 was operational and not a result of psychological stress on the part of Site-██ personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
