<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-238</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All efforts to capture SCP-238 are to be ended immediately. Any still-floating or found instances of SCP-238 are to be retrieved and placed into storage.</p><p>Contact is to be maintained with local governments in case of potential sightings. In the event of an outbreak, Mobile Task Force λ-10 ("Healing Care") is to be held at readiness at Site 19.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-238 is a phenomenon in which instances of SCP-238 spontaneously materialize and float through the air or ground. Instances are spherical and contain no discernible composition, but appear to be made of hardened biological fluids.</p><p>Cautionary notices must be posted on all buildings, vehicles, and objects where SCP-238 may be found.</p><p>Instances of SCP-238 typically appear near large groups of humanoid beings. Affected individuals report a strong desire to approach one of the organism's trailing tentacles, despite their medical condition. Affected parties will then attempt to climb onto the instance, stating that they feel compelled to do so. They proceed to explore the instance's interior, returning with small pieces of tissue. Affected victims will then attempt to consume the tissue themselves. Within hours, affected persons develop a permanent growth on a fingertip that they believe is part of their own body.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
