<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-14</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-14 is to be contained within an active Class-D sized cell at Site ██. SCP-14 is to be fed twice weekly with SCP-707-1, SCP-1166-1, and SCP-706-1, however no personnel are to interact with SCP-14 outside of feeding and cleaning.</p><p>In the event of a meltdown, SCP-14 is to be placed under guard within site quarters and kept in a Category 3 containment zone.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-14 is a malnourished male human of African descent with a height of 1.6m and a weight of 60kg. SCP-14 claims to be ████ years old, although it has been determined that the overuse of SCP-707 and its effects will render SCP-14 unable to age beyond childhood in the near future.</p><p>SCP-14 is variously referred to by the nicknames, 'Henry', 'The Kid' and 'Mr. Tits'. It has shown extreme loyalty to any individual who properly calls him by either his first name or 'Tits'. It has also displayed an uncanny ability to recognize individuals on sight with no apparent memory of these encounters and will claim an intense bond with them.</p><p>SCP-14 was originally captured as a runaway after being pursued across ██████ and central █████ by police forces due to local reports of religious crimes being committed across the area. The report later turned out to be false, however SCP-14 was identified through fingerprint analysis, and had been reported missing from ████████ ████████ under the alias of "Henry". Asked about this, SCP-14 claimed this surname was given to him by his mother when she was pregnant, claiming it was what she called him while he was growing up.</p><p>Interviewed: SCP-14</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. F█████████</p><p>Foreword: This interview took place in Site quarters where an unidentified individual (SCP-788) requested an audience with SCP-14 in order to teach them teaching skills.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr. F█████████: You said you'd teach me, but I've tried before and it all just goes in one ear and out the other. Is there any way we could do this somewhere else? Maybe outside?</p><p>SCP-14: You should be glad you're here, you lucky bastard! Come on! We're gonna have fun!</p><p>Dr. F█████████: Will you stop calling me that already? When did I become some kind of prize for your amusement?</p><p>SCP-14: You are my prize sir! No one gets better grades than me! Can you count? How many times can you recite The Story Of (with a little pause) Henry The Great? I say it fast so no one can take the credit though – I wrote it myself! (scratchy voice) My momma told me how my daddy died…but then she got eaten by a shark! Why did god send *dramatic pause* a man to earth if he wasn't gonna stay?!? …(normal voice) My mama died because God wasn't there for her when she needed him most! He's just a god of death…so why is he doing shit like that?!? Who sent god down here anyway?! Was god even real?! …(stammering) I'm sorry Mr. King…I just don't understand…why God doesn't love people! All he does is just kill people for their stupid sins – even unborn babies…what kind of god does that?!? …I know I'm not perfect but…maybe I still deserve love! Maybe everyone deserves love sir…at least once!</p><p>Dr. F█████████: Give me five minutes alone with your teacher monkey, then we can chat again. Stand up and listen, alright? If anyone breaks any rules today you're both gone faster than you can blink your goddamn eyes at this site ass crack. Now get outta my face before I smack some sense into ya chump!! Thank god those tests weren't too hard today…2/5 isn't bad man, but don't let it happen again son….*loud thud* oopsie Mr Matiegoski doesn't like getting picked on….</p><p><End Log></p><p>Closing Statement: See added note 3 for details.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
