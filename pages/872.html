<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-872</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-872 is to be kept in a locked locker at Site-52. SCP-872 is to be stored with the rest of standard Foundation equipment whenever not in use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-872 is a military surplus backpack. In appearance, SCP-872 is identical to other standard rucksacks used in military training. The only distinguishing feature of SCP-872 is a large anomaly on the back that extends approximately 3 meters, and does not appear to be made of any known materials.</p><p>SCP-872 when used as a backpack for experimental purposes will often cause any equipment inside SCP-872 to fluctuate in temperature, move randomly and adjust its locality with the slightest change in position. If the equipment is within 10 cm from the center of the anomaly, a significant increase in temperature and decreased mobility can occur, until the equipment begins to melt into the center from both sides if not removed from the center immediately. During these events, personnel within 4 m including testing equipment are unaffected by this effect.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
