<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-281</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-281 is to be contained in a standard lockbox, with only two openings. It is to be kept at the Simple Object Containment Lab (SOCL) at Site-19; all tests involving SCP-281 are to be performed in the presence of at least one (1) level 3 personnel.</p><p>Upon request, SCP-281 may be held in custody of an off-site unit associated with the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-281 is a 19.5 cm tall sculpture made of papier mache, with a small paintbrush affixed to the left side of its jaw. The brush is painted with different colors; thus far, all colors listed as used in SCP-281's creation have been found.</p><p>Any living organism will feel great comfort while in the presence of SCP-281. It displays an extremely strong attraction to them, and will often display signs of affection by licking or nibbling on their body.</p><p>SCP-281 will attempt to avoid conflict (defined as physical contact between any two organisms) with any other living creature that has not seen it before. SCP-281 will peacefully coexist with another living creature if they are able to see one another. If anything causes SCP-281 to become confused, it will immediately seek out another face that it knows it can trust and show affection towards them; this effect will continue until the confusion is resolved.</p><p>Upon being exposed to any living being that has not seen it before, SCP-281 will rearrange itself such that it 'surveys' the new face(s) and then transition into a comfortably sitting position. Researchers have noted that SCP-281 seems to enjoy seeing this behavior in multiple individuals, but does not seem phased by it at all.</p><p>Addenda:</p><p>Several months after being contained at Site-19, SCP-181 was requested for testing in order to determine whether or not SCPs were capable of learning from each other's behaviors. After displaying the same affectivity towards SCPs as usual, SCP-181 became unresponsive for approximately ten seconds when accompanied by both SCP-281 and SCP-5754. At this time, a number of crows residing outside Site-19 began screaming loudly due to their inability to locate an available source of food or shelter. When the two anomalous objects were separated back into their separate enclosures, security personnel were required to sedate six (6) birds outside the facility with injections of amnestics; note that none of these birds showed any signs of distress or weakness during this ordeal.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
