<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-653</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-653 is contained in a standard containment locker at Site-34, where it is to be kept in a non-hazardous liquid medium. Any further testing involving the object must be approved by personnel with level 4 clearance or higher, and has been approved for testing purposes through Dr. ██████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-653 is a liquid, apparently an aqueous suspension of carbon dioxide molecules (hereafter SCP-653-B) that has been saturated by water vapor to a saturation level of 55%. The density of the object is 1.3 g/cm, matching the density of water, and does not appear to change in any measurable way when subjected to different pressures.</p><p>The object will be affected by forces applied to it. When acted upon by normal physical forces, such as touch or shaking, the object will flow freely through its suspension medium. When acted upon by greater forces, the substance will increase and decrease in volume quickly, resulting in significant changes in pressure and temperature.</p><p>Although the force applied to SCP-653 appears to have an effect on SCP-653 itself and its behavior, the more force applied, the less effect SCP-653-B has on those who interact with it. An individual who is saturated by SCP-653-B will be resistant against additional forces applied to them previously. This limits the ability to lift objects weighing over 0.03 grams using only their hands. A person who is saturated by SCP-653 will not feel discomfort or pain from such forces until their saturation level reaches a value exceeding their own mass. When saturation reaches their weight, they will fall unconscious from lack of oxygen, due to decreasing tissue oxygenation and increasing pressure leading to hypoxia.[C]</p><p>Consumption of any fluid fluid containing the substance has resulted in death for all test subjects immediately following saturation; however, live human test subjects have survived up to 21 days without food or water, although they show signs of fatigue and dehydration. Experimentation into these effects are currently ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
