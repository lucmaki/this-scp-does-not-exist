<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-245</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation respons teams are to maintain a constant surveillance of critical infrastructure, as well as monitor national news outlets for any mention of SCP-245. If such reports are detected, agents are to retrieve copies of the reports and disseminate them through media outlets or political influence.</p><p>In the event SCP-245 becomes uncontainable, amnestics are to be distributed to local residents and recorded media is to be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-245 is a phenomenon which causes minor alterations to the flow of information. It works by making false claims about events or entities, causing subsequent reports to be interpreted as true when they are not. These false claims are usually isolated facts and therefore do not affect the overall perception of reality.</p><p>It is currently unknown how SCP-245 achieves its effect, but it has been observed to work on both human and non-human observers. Human observers have proven to be affected by SCP-245 in slightly different ways depending on their level of knowledge about the subject at hand. For example, an average citizen might be incorrectly informed that a major city had been attacked by terrorists, while a political expert would be informed that [DATA EXPUNGED]. The level of inaccuracy varies widely, but can still affect people if enough time passes between exposure and knowledge of the actual facts.</p><p>As with all phenomena of this nature, SCP-245 will wear off over time, eventually resulting in only partial awareness of what was formerly known as reality.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
