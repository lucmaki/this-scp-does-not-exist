<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-644</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-644 is contained within a standard D-class containment cell. SCP-644 has no need for food, water or air-supply, and thus is not a threat to the Foundation or any other entity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-644 is an anomalous Earthbound Gardening implement. It resembles a standard pair of secateurs, with wooden handles and a wooden blade. SCP-644 behaves in a manner typical for other earthbound objects, always residing in the same place when not being used, and moving itself and its "mulch" at a desired velocity when being used.</p><p>SCP-644 also grows plants at an accelerated rate. SCP-644 continues to grow plants even if removed from outside of an environment (such as SCP-2099 or SCP-461). The current number of plants that have grown from this effect is unknown.</p><p>SCP-644 was recovered when Foundation agents captured a white light manifestation of SCP-644 (regarded as a high ranking entity) as it attempted to escape into the house of a local farmer. The entity was taken into Foundation custody and could not be located after the anomaly manifested inside a Foundation containment facility, despite intensive search efforts.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
