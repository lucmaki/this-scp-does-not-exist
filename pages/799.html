<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-799</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-799 is stored in a sealed box, located in Sector-25. A key is held by an agent of the Foundation on each shift. No personnel are permitted to make any notes on SCP-799 without explicit permission from their supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-799 is a standard black 3.5" x 5" piece of paper, weighing 125g and measuring 5 cm x 7 cm. SCP-799 does not appear to have any writing on it regardless of the method used to write on it. SCP-799 does not display any anomalous behavior when viewed by unfamiliar individuals.</p><p>When someone writes on the surface of SCP-799, the text within will typically appear in the region where the writing was made. This effect immediately degrades over time, with writing displayed no more than 2 hours after creation. Further experimentation has shown that writing will remain on the paper for up to 12 hours in total before degrading.</p><p>SCP-799 was discovered after the death of Dr ████ ██████████ from severe brucellosis brought about by consuming contaminated raw milk produced by Dr ██████'s dairy farm. After his death, it was discovered that all of the rations consumed by Dr ██████████ had gained sapience and conversed with him prior to his death, telling him at one point "I know why you are here". It was also noted that written letters addressed to Dr ██████████ would be delivered to his family in ████ shortly after they were posted.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
