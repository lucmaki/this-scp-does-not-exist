<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-719</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Within the city of Ypsilanti, Michigan, Amatoxins Research Building and Laboratory is to be constructed. The building will be built to the specifications of Dr. Ibata. A list of requirements for SCP-719 is to be submitted to Dr. Ibata on a monthly basis. In addition, a list of approved biomass sources is to be submitted to Dr. Ibata for approval before any resource can be harvested for SCP-719's production.</p><p>SCP-719 is to be stored in a 5-m tall steel cylinder, with dimensions 1 meter long by 0.2 meters wide and two meters high. SCP-719 is not to be opened without Dr. Ibata's approval, as she must be able to verify that it contains no carnivorous animal remains or hormones left behind after it was extracted from the individual specimen's body.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-719 is a source of genetically modified proteins, which is created by converting the flesh of an animal into part of the substance. It appears to be capable of interacting with humans in a symbiotic fashion, allowing it to remain within their body after extraction. SCP-719 will begin to multiply exponentially within a human body, eventually producing enough biomass to force the subject's jawbone and bones to fracture and separate from surrounding tissue. This process is reversible through SCP-719 excision — removal of the mass of SCP-719 — or amputation.</p><p>SCP-719 was originally discovered in Ypsilanti, Michigan, when Dr. Ibata, who was engaged in her fieldwork studying carnivorous ants, learned that a cornfield behind her house had been modified with a chemical substance increasing its nutritional value. After harvesting several samples from the field, she noticed that all samples contained ovaries, testes and other glands belonging to animals. Further investigation lead her to discover that this substance, as well as similar substances found in meat and animals on farms nearby, were produced by sulfur bacteria living inside insects' bodies. The bacteria still exist (causing higher infection rates in some areas), but it has not yet been determined where they came from originally.</p><p>Dr. Ibata decided to use SCP-719 for her experiments and discovered that it would act as a powerful antifeminism agent — contained in males by removing their testes and ovaries and stored in females' bodies until fertilized eggs are ready to be pulled out. When used outside an individual specimen's body, SCP-719 has no effect on them due to its lack of intelligence; thus excision is required before it can be used.</p><p>When an individual is injured and their body suffers widespread cellular damage due to excessive cellular necrosis (reduced health/function), their natural self-repair mechanisms kick in and they attempt to regrow damaged parts of their body using any available resources (usually blood vessels). The process begins by triggering the production of male hormones at a high enough rate that they cannot be prevented from being released outside the body — however, this fails because the arteries have been blocked off by the mass of SCP-719 contained within them. Once the mass is removed from the bloodstream, spontaneous castration occurs within 5 seconds after tissue necrosis has begun and all surviving veins are severed within 10 minutes if not already done so because necrosis does not occur until after healthy tissue has been affected. Without surgical removal, an individual will slowly die of massive blood loss over approximately 2 weeks time due to salt loss from damaged cells and inability for non-blood vessels to provide nutrients necessary for survival (see Researcher Testimony).</p><p>Excision should also be performed upon pregnant females if possible; however this may prove difficult if they are unable to survive without their current source of food supply due to pregnancy hormones acting faster than male hormones. A fetus may survive incineration or live birth if separated from its mother early enough in gestation — however it must be noted that surgery performed during gestation often results in more severe cases of blood loss than those performed after delivery.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
