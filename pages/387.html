<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-387</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-387 is to be stored in a standard Foundation titanium vault. The interior of SCP-387 is to be kept at a temperature of 5 °C.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-387 is a small, 129 m long ship (engulfing SCP-387 B) which uses a hybrid propulsion system consisting of internal combustion engines and magnetic drive motors. The propulsion system is located in the middle of the ship.</p><p>The engine compartment contains four cylindrical tanks, each lined with rubber membranes intended to prevent impact damage. These tanks, when filled with liquid fuel, expand slightly and are connected by hoses to the drive motors located outside of SCP-387. Gasoline is being burned when the speed of SCP-387 exceeds 25 knots (33.6 km/h). When the speed drops below this value, SCP-387 will begin to reduce its speed by accelerating or simply breaking from it. When SCP-387 has stopped, the fuel will evaporate into the atmosphere and leave no extra residue on it.</p><p>The ship's keel mounts two large underwater surveillance cameras on each side of the hull. They can be turned manually for aiming purposes. The camera housings are made of titanium but every tenth section has been replaced with metal reinforced plastic to better protect sensitive parts from damage caused by corrosion. As such, these parts are marked red on the exterior and internally as well.</p><p>SCP-387 emits a pitch black light coming from the open spaces in its deck and bridge area, despite the lack of any windows on those areas. This anomaly disappears whenever SCP-387 is traveling at speeds higher than 15 km/h with no additional sources of illumination present in those spaces.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
