<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-602</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Information regarding the existence of SCP-602 is to be suppressed by any and all means necessary, including but not limited to disinformation campaigns, propaganda, censorship, and misinformation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-602 is a piece of software written by ███████ ██████, commonly known as "the Unibomber". It is an interactive virtual reality environment that allows users to explore the mind of ███████ ██████.</p><p>SCP-602 exists in a semi-hypnotic state when it is not being used by personnel. While in this state, SCP-602's functions can be accessed through the use of a keyboard and monitor. The user will find themselves in a room containing multiple chairs and a table. On the table are several objects bearing the designation "SCP-602". These objects act as markers for locations within SCP-602's simulated environment. The order in which these markers are placed on the table varies from user to user, but in all cases they always form a geometric pattern.</p><p>Once the marker has been placed on the table, the user may activate SCP-602 through completing a series of tasks that allow them to communicate with ███████ ██████. This communication is nonverbal and takes place through thought impulses that are projected into the brain of the user.</p><p>The exact tasks required to gain access to SCP-602 vary depending on the user, but typically involve an attempt to obtain knowledge through conversations with ███████ ██████. The end result usually consists of either frustrating or confusing information being communicated by SCP-602.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
