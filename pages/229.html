<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-229</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-229 instances are to be contained in reinforced high-security cryogenic containers, located within a Type 1 Safe at Site-25's Cryogenics Wing. When such an instance is removed from its containment space, it is to be attached by several straps and cables to a large ring and suspended over the main chamber of the Type 1 Safe.</p><p>The interior surface of the Type 1 safe is lined with a reflective coating for protection against accidental exposure to SCP-229. When not in use, the Safe's interior should be left empty to reduce the likelihood of an accidental breach.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-229 is a collection of several hundred skeletal remains recovered from a small structure located in Solomon Islands. The corpses have yet to be properly identified. The bones lack any known pathological characteristics, but do appear to be more akin to those recovered from an ancient burial site on Mars than anything living on Earth.</p><p>When SCP-229's temperature has fallen below approximately -133 °C (zero kelvins), it will begin to expel large quantities of frozen carbon dioxide gas from various orifices and pores within its structure. At this temperature, these gas emissions will not travel more than 200 meters from where they were released.</p><p>The amount of carbon dioxide produced by an SCP-229 instance is directly proportional to the temperature of its interior space; when heated to a temperature above -40 °C (-40 °F) it will also produce significant volumes of highly fluorine containing compounds and compounds containing silicon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
