<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-508</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-508 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. While SCP-508's abilities do not appear to extend to the breaching of this containment, Foundation agents embedded within SPM state that no unauthorized openings have been detected in SCP-508's chamber walls or ceiling since initial containment.</p><p>SCP-508 is to be given twice daily meals of small amounts of either raw or cooked fish and twice daily drinkings from bottled water. Doses of amnestics are to be administered whenever necessary for transfer of knowledge concerning the use of SCP-508's abilities.</p><p>Any other personnel wishing to witness the effects of fine tuning may be granted permission by the head researcher; any updates on SCP-508's current situation are to be relayed directly to Dr. █████, head researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-508, designated as "tatsuya" in Japanese and "Arnold" in English, is a humanoid entity measuring 1.62m in height and weighing 55kg. SCP-508 possesses two anomalously acute senses of hearing and smell, as well as an unknown number of sharp teeth.</p><p>SCP-508 appears to operate on the basis of fine tuning; in this capacity, it has been capable of reducing the size of objects by approximately 0.5cm using only its sense of smell. SCP-508 also has the ability to modify the sensory output of these fine tuned objects, allowing it to perceive any logically possible variable (including some initially impossible variables). SCP-508 has been known to produce up to twenty such fine tuned objects at a time before being depleted of energy, during which time SCP-508 appears to lose consciousness or cease functioning completely until it can replenish itself with additional supplies of highly porous objects from within its cell.</p><p>SCP-508's current containment cell was constructed to eliminate all normal openings; however, it is still able to escape through any other means.</p><p>SCP-508 is capable of speaking several languages including English, Chinese, Russian and French with varying levels of proficiency. It is capable of conversing in limited fashion with Foundation personnel if given direct access to foreign nationals who have not yet been implanted with amnestic memory suppression agents; however, Foundation linguists have noted that SCP-508 tends not speak directly about its abilities unless they are directly asked by another person who can understand him without prior knowledge of what he is capable of doing with his tongue.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
