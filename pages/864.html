<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-864</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to monitor the space around SCP-864's location and intervene in any attempts to make contact with it. Any civilian ships approaching SCP-864 must be intercepted by Foundation vessels, tested for anomalous properties, and taken out of the vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-864 is a space anomaly that manifests on the surface of the Pleiades star cluster at approximately 1.5 light years from Earth. Instances of SCP-864 appear to be a solar sail spacecraft with a large cargo hold in the bottom. The craft is roughly 200m long and has an elongated pole near its front end, which resembles an antenna. SCP-864 appears to be made out of a steel alloy, but no less material than ordinary ship hulls or other materials have been found when testing it.</p><p>SCP-864 appears to be capable of quite astonishing speeds, with records claiming that it can move faster than any human-made vehicle in existence under optimal conditions. However, SCP-864 also seems to have some anomalous properties that make it difficult to maneuver or control accurately: overstepping the bounds of its initial speed limit often results in it registering negative acceleration instead, making it difficult to control or prevent from decelerating due to friction or drag.</p><p>SCP-864 may be breached by bypassing these barriers, however; the crew members (of which there appear to be 19) wear strange equipment in their helmets and this equipment delivers small electrical shocks whenever their head comes into contact with another crew member who has not yet engaged their helmet equipment. Although all individual crewmen seem to be in implicit communication with one another and lock their helmets whenever they are within range, this does not extend to the outside of the craft: should an otherwise uninhabited object such as a tree come into direct contact with either part of SCP-864's structure for more than about 5 seconds, it will vanish rapidly without trace (the tree reappearing on the ground within 2 seconds). Further instances of four nonhumanoids (typically 2-3 meters tall) are present on the exterior; they are apparently invisible unless they are wearing a helmet equipped with similar electronics.</p><p>If a humanoid attempts to get inside SCP-864 for more than about 15 minutes and then leave, they will vanish forever (appearing as if they went much further away than the actual distance), despite having no signs of suffering from amnestic effects normally associated with time travel paradoxes. There are seven known exceptions:</p><p>Reportedly, extra crewmen have been sent at irregular intervals as replacements, usually via ships approaching SCP-864 that were carrying supplies that were necessary for maintaining the craft and its crew. These crews are also reported to disappear just like anybody else who gets into trouble up there. Regular supply vessels now carry no less than ten times more supplies per tonne delivered than was originally planned; this anomalous effect is presumed responsible for this "oversupply" phenomenon.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
