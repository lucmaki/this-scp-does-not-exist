<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-909</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-909 is to be kept in a large scientific containment chamber, accessible by personnel via a locked door at the end of a long hallway. A single video camera is permitted in the containment area, but no other surveillance equipment may be used.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-909 appears to be a large black sphere, approximately 1.5 meters in diameter, with an outer radius of 2.9 meters and an interior radius of 4.5 meters. When first discovered, it was thought to be a space probe.</p><p>When SCP-909 is moved into an area containing a person or animal, it will attempt to communicate with the subject by means of some form of "alien" language, usually English translated into the language of the subject's choice. The entity that speaks through SCP-909 appears to be [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
