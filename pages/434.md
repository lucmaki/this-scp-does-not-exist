<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-434</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-434 is to be contained within a standard high-security containment locker at Site-██. Access to the item is restricted to Level 3 security personnel. Any personnel attempting to enter an area containing SCP-434 must first be screened for amnestic drugs and psychological issues. If a Level 4 security clearance is required, subject is to be escorted to the testing chamber by two (2) D-Class personnel at least 1.3 m (4 ft) away from the object. Testing for SCP-434 must be approved by a Level 3 or higher staff member, in writing, before any testing begins.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-434 is a briefcase, approximately 87x37x24cm (36x16x9in), bearing a seal similar to that of the [REDACTED] Company. When opened, the seal will display an image of the object's living cargo within a 2.5 meter radius. As long as the image remains, those viewing the briefcase instantly possess information pertaining to said subject. Subjects with implanted knowledge are not affected by SCP-434.</p><p>The exact effect of this object on other personnel has yet to be determined; testing has shown that D-Class and higher personnel do not have a complete knowledge of their captives, but it is unknown whether High-level staff or civilians are affected as well.</p><p>SCP-434 was contained in Site-██ after an incident involving its usage in Foundation interrogation tactics resulted in two agents being permanently disabled. Samples of the substance were also isolated and developed into a class-A amnestic and ██ other individuals were given mild behavioral alterations.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
