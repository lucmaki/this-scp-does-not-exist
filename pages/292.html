<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-292</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-292 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. The key may only be removed or opened by personnel assigned to this task. In the event that SCP-292's containment container is breached, it is to be sealed and the object destroyed.</p><p>A pair of security cameras have been installed to monitor SCP-292's area of confinement. Any personnel attempting to remove the object are to be monitored via the security cameras in order to track their movements and report any suspicious activity. Any information regarding attempts to circumvent protocol or gain access to SCP-292 are to be considered a high priority security breach, and all pertinent information recorded (see File 291-1).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-292 is a standard black leather wallet, measuring approximately 5 cm x 8 cm in size. It contains four compartments, each containing a card of some kind. The object's outer appearance has not changed since the time of its initial discovery, and the cards continue to display their original design and branding.</p><p>Three out of the four interior card slots contain recognizable cards, but are inscribed with the words "Assembled" or "Disassembled", both in English and Russian (the language used on SCP-292). These are designated 293, 294 and 295 respectively. The fourth compartment is empty, with no card corresponding to it.</p><p>When presented with a card inserted into any of the other three slots, SCP-292 will open up to include a miniature photograph of one of the person(s) listed on that card. The photographs change constantly, depending on individuals SCP-292 previously contained, with some photographs being extremely distorted by molds and/or damage. These photographs usually show several individuals standing in various locations (i.e., in an office building or confined to an elevator), and some of these photographs are covered by plaster from damaged ceilings. Other photographs depict individuals in groups at outdoor locations (e.g., attending outdoor events or hiking), and others show individuals involved in various activities related to professions for which no persons have been identified (e.g., construction crews or reception staff). When asked, SCP-292 will claim that there are no names listed on any of its cards.</p><p>In addition to the storage capacity provided by its compartments, SCP-292 has a slot at its center which can store another item, such as a key or credit card. This can be used to expand its storage capacity, but also allows access to further anomalous properties when used in this fashion.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
