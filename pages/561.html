<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-561</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-561 is kept in high-security Containment Unit 16, located in the underground level of Site-77. It is to be kept on a plexiglass cage measuring 6 meters in length, 3 cm in thickness, and 25 cm in height, suspended above a wide circular pool of water on a platform at least 2 meters in diameter. All attempts at communication with SCP-561 must be conducted by personnel wearing earplugs, as SCP-561 has demonstrated the ability to put out ears without injury. The aforementioned dimensions are to remain fixed at all times, and no personnel or materials are to enter the containment chamber except for authorized testing.</p><p>The containment chamber is to be monitored at all times for any signs of movement or change in shape through video imaging systems. Personnel are not to enter the chamber unless authorized by Level 4 personnel. All testing must follow approved instructions from at least level 4 staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-561 is a sasquatch-like humanoid (reclassified as Homo sasquaticus)12. Its appearance and demeanor is similar to that of a human, but with several differences. First, SCP-561's head is very large relative to its body, with an estimated volume almost twice that of a human being. Second, all organs have been replaced by solid steel one for each bodily function except for the heart, which has been removed and coupled to a secondary oxygen tank. The lungs are not present in this case, as they would impede movement in and out of the steel organs.</p><p>SCP-561's arms are disproportionately small compared to its body mass and support most of the weight. The limbs articulate at the elbow and wrist; therefore, SCP-561 cannot bend at the elbows or wrists. SCP-561's hands possess a metallic claw attached to scoops on each finger.</p><p>SCP-561's torso is also comprised entirely of steel organs. The heart has been removed entirely and is suspended in a vacuum chamber close to its lungs; a tube protrudes from the left side of its chest, terminating at the primary oxygen tank. Two spinal columns emerge from this area, both resembling steel lumbers 10 centimeters thick running down its midline.</p><p>SCP-561 wears a body harness connected to two cables running through its spine and connected to containers filled with lead oxide flakes suspended above them; these flakes act as suspension agents and prevent SCP-561 from falling into water. A video camera system embedded in SCP-561's mouth allows live feed of what is happening outside the chamber through speakers implanted in SCP-561's ears.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
