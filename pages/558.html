<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-558</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has already recovered all of the components of SCP-558.</p><p>Due to the nature of these entities, they have been neutralized and destroyed. All associated memetic effects have been removed from around the world. It is hypothesized that this will also make it difficult for future manifestations of SCP-558 in nature to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-558 is a large light fixture in the shape of a double helix with a central hub. SCP-558's design refers to DNA, its components being phosphorous and magnesium. The illumination provided by SCP-558 was an anomalous effect that only occurred during full moon cycles.</p><p>When exposed to live human subjects, humans within 150 meters would be shown how their own DNA works. This did not affect Foundation personnel or animals, but additional testing should be done on it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
