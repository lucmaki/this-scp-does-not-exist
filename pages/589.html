<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-589</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-589 is to be contained in a humanoid containment chamber. SCP-589 is to be given a standard ration, and provided with access to television entertainment. Any information gained from an interview with SCP-589, or any other source, is to be destroyed after recording.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-589 is a 20 year old man of Italian descent. SCP-589 has been classified as mentally unhealthy, and is currently held in psychiatric confinement at ████ Hospital Foundation. SCP-589 suffered from [DATA EXPUNGED] early in his life, but also has a long history of drug use.</p><p>SCP-589 is an expert typist, and an advanced computer user. SCP-589 is unable to read or write English fluently (though has displayed partial literacy up to the age of 12), though he speaks fluent Italian. SCP-589 has not spoken any language other than Italian since childhood (though knowledge of Italian grammar and pronunciation are well above average), and understands most Italian dialects.</p><p>SCP-589 repeats words and phrases almost perfectly, correct grammar and syntax, even when not attempting to speak English. This ability can be used through means other than verbal speech, as it extends to written language. For instance, after being asked a question in Italian, SCP-589 will demonstrate the proper usage of the word "si" ("yes") without any hesitation or difficulty demonstrating this skill.</p><p>Prior to containment, SCP-059 demonstrated several unusual behaviors including:</p><p>Interviewed: SCp-589</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
