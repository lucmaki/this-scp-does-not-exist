<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-235</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-235 is currently in Foundation custody, and is to be held in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Testing of SCP-235 requires advance approval from a level 3 personnel with at least three months of experience acting as a test subject.</p><p>In the event that testing of SCP-235 is warranted, the following guidelines are to be followed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-235 is a small wooden box, 10 cm x 8 cm x 7 cm in size. The lid is of a plain wood, and has only one hole for viewing the contents within. SCP-235 appears to be made from a single piece of wood, although tests have confirmed that it sways slightly when opened.</p><p>When open, SCP-235 will display an old black and white photo measuring 17 cm x 12 cm when not folded or placed on a flat surface. The photo depicts an elderly man with grey hair wearing formal attire. Despite being thirty years old at the time of the photo's creation, the gentleman appears to be well into his seventies or eighties. Both the man and woman appear to be smiling at the camera.</p><p>If the photo is unfolded or allowed to hang freely in a room or hallway, several anomalies will be observed. When unfolded further, the image will show several additions to the original image. These additions are all related to the anomalous properties of SCP-235 itself, and include:</p><p>Alternatively, pressing down on one of four "clapboard" objects in the photo may reveal another addition relevant to SCP-235's properties. referred to as "clapboard effects". These additional images are described below.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
