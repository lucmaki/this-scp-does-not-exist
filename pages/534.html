<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-534</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Inside SCP-534, access is only to be granted via several sets of tunnels. Security personnel are to be stationed outside of the entrances, and entry into the site is strictly forbidden. In the event that any unauthorized entities enter the site, a large crowd is to be herded in front of the entrance, thereby obstructing all exits. All personnel entering SCP-534 must be armed with tasers, and any attempt to escape or steal from SCP-534 must be met with lethal force.</p><p>As of 09/06/2018, SCP-534 has been declared an extant urban legend by local authorities. Residents are advised to report any unusual activity to local police authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-534 is an abandoned military facility located in the Guía Ventós region of [REDACTED], Spain.</p><p>The main building appears to have been built during the Spanish Civil War and was abandoned after World War One, remaining mostly intact until the 1970s. The facility consisted of four structures:</p><p>A loud, thumping was heard emanating from SCP-534 for the first time on 09/06/2018 at approximately 04:30 AM local time. All recordings preceding this date have been recovered and are listed below.</p><p>Recording 1: Low, rumbling sound heard through ground, possibly due to flooding as of 09/06/2018 at 04:10 AM local time.</p><p>Recording 2: Loud, rumbling sound heard through ground, possibly due to flooding as of 09/06/2018 at 04:30 AM local time.</p><p>Recording 3: Loud, rumbling sound heard through ground, possibly due to flooding as of 09/06/2018 at 04:40 AM local time.</p><p>Recording 4: Loud, rumbling sound heard through ground, possibly due to flooding as of 09/06/2018 at 04:50 AM local time.</p><p>Noises are still audible from outside the structure on subsequent recordings. Foundation personnel have attempted to enter SCP-534 and document the cause for its activity. Foundation contractors have logged a variety of anomalous phenomena related to SCP-534 over the last 100 years; if you find any more descriptions or recordings that don't fit into our database please let us know!</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
