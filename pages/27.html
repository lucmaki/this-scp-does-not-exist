<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-27</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-27 is to be kept indoors in a standard containment locker inside of Site-46. No personnel are allowed to enter SCP-27's containment area at any time; if this is deemed necessary, the presence of two security personnel assigned to the project is required.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-27 is a large, black beetle approximately ten centimeters long and four centimeters wide. It is capable of infecting electronic devices with a mobile program. In order to do this, SCP-27 must be given access to the device at which it is intended to infect.</p><p>Once infected, the device will begin recording audio files of various content and begin broadcasting loud, oddly distorted screams over any network that is connected to it. The screams will not have intelligible words in them, but instead are comprised of random intervals of screaming with no discernible pattern; these recordings are said to contain torture techniques such as electrocution or immolation. Many individuals infected by SCP-27 have reported intense pain and suffering from these recordings.</p><p>There does not appear to be any way to remove the infection from an electronic device once it has been sustained by SCP-27. Testing has shown that recordings made by devices infected by SCP-27 are stored on the device itself so that they may not be confiscated for analysis; when an infected device is taken outside of containment, the screams produced by it are said to become increasingly louder and more painful as if being broadcast back through its 'headset' at Site-46.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
