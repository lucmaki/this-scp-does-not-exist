<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-800</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Several instances of SCP-800 are to be kept in a wooden box at Site-77. The lid is to be removed before testing, and replaced afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-800 is a toy train set, comprised of a total of seven vehicles. SCP-800 is powered by batteries, and has no apparent remote control. The gears of all SCP-800 vehicles are similarly mounted to each other, and cannot be removed from the main chassis.</p><p>This anomalous property allows SCP-800 to perform stunts that would be impossible for a regular set. For instance, the locomotive will move off the track and roll away when left unattended. However, if any part of the train is manually moved or affected with an event, it will immediately return to its position on the track. Otherwise, SCP-800 operates as a normal toy would.</p><p>SCP-800 appears to exhibit some degree of sentience in its behavior. More specifically, it responds to its internal clock and seems to display an innate sense of humor in its passing comments after incidents.</p><p>How SCP-800 comes into existance is unknown; however, the Foundation has been aware of it since 1980. Currently no leads have been found regarding how to remove the anomaly without destroying it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
