<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-129</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All liquor stores within the city limits of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota are to be monitored for any signs of SCP-129's activity. Any manifestation is to be reported immediately to Mobile Task Force Psi-7 "Twin Cities Zeros". MTF Psi-7 has a dedicated Task Force Command Post located at Site-17.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-129 is a manifestation of a small-scale brewery that opened in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. The name and logo of the brewery match those used by real firm Twin Cities Brewing Company, Inc. The brewing company itself is not anomalous, and has its headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p><p>SCP-129 appears to be able to exist within a range of several miles around these two cities; however, no active manifestations have ever been found outside this range. Manifestations of SCP-129 do not reflect the actual location of the brewery; SCP-129 always appears as though it is located in an urban area within the "city limits" of Minneapolis or St. Paul.</p><p>The name and logo used by SCP-129 are identical to those used by Twin Cities Brewing Company's locations. However, due to the fact that it is located outside the physical location of its namesake, SCP-129 will refer to itself as "Twin Cities Brewing Company's Homebrewery," where "Homebrewery" is written using the same font used for other SCP objects' names. This effect is limited only to documents recognized as being associated with SCP-129; for instance, any document printed via SCP-129 will use the actual font used by other corporations as well as standard business documents from the present day.</p><p>SCP-129 does not appear to share any conscious experiences or memories with any humans outside its area of influence; however, it does have records for every employee at each local tavern or bar in which it has manifested (see Addendum). While employees may ask warehouse "employees" questions regarding storage conditions or brewing procedures, they will get no answer until they specifically ask about Twin Cities Brewing Company. None of these employees has been shown to possess knowledge of subjects outside their normal jobs, although they do claim they know how to operate machinery based on signs left behind by previous companies who had worked at Twin Cities Brewing Company's brewery before it was destroyed by fire on September 19th 1999.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
