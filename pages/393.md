<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-393</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-393 is kept at Site 21 in a standard containment locker. The object is to be kept under a minimum of 50 liters of water at all times, with the possibility for increasing the volume of water if necessary. Any persons having knowledge of SCP-393's true nature are to be prevented from disclosing this information and their life terminated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-393 is a threadbare photograph depicting a duck wearing a sailor hat that has been scorched by some form of heat source. The image is illegible due to the image having been damaged in a not yet understood way.</p><p>When exposed to water, SCP-393 will cause all water within around 100 meters of it to accelerate towards an infinite point. At this point, water will cease to be a medium through which any other object may travel and become composed entirely of water that appears as nothing more than a black liquid sphere. The radius of this sphere is approximately 3 meters at its outer edge, but can expand rapidly at the expense of the density of its content. Any living organism that enters this sphere will be subjected to no less than 20 seconds of complete submersion in the sphere's content, with continued immersion resulting in death via drowning.</p><p>The effects of SCP-393 are permanent, with no known way of reversing them short of destroying the object in question. There have been occasional reports of subjects surviving the event normally, but these reports are extremely rare for reasons unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
