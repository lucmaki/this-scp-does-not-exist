<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-370</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-370 is to be held in a standard Safe object locker at Site-77. It is not to be removed from its chamber except for testing purposes by at least two (2) Level 2 personnel and no less than two (2) Level 4 personnel. Any personnel attempting to enter the chamber without authorization must be met with lethal force.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-370 is a wooden statue of a humanoid female figure. The figure has no body parts missing and is otherwise in good condition. When examined closely, the figure closely resembles an early 20th century photograph of Dorothy Dietrich.</p><p>SCP-370 displays no anomalous properties outside of its containment chamber. It was first discovered lying in its original location, resting in a wooden box along with the handwritten note:</p><p>When opened and inspected closely, the note reads:</p><p>The note is written in French and was found amongst SCP-370's possessions. The lettering is faded, as if written long ago, but possesses a distinct handwriting style.</p><p>The enclosed item is SCP-370-2, a crudely carved wooden disk measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter inscribed with symbols and runes. No two instances are exactly alike and have differing designs and colors. Each instance appears to have been carved by hand from a single piece of wood around 500 to 1000 years ago.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
