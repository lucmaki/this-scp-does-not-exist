<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-504</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The containment site is to be disguised as an abandoned warehouse with a collapsed roof and littered with debris. The site is to be monitored at all times by a group of four (4) personnel, disguised as workers or maintenance staff, who are to employ Houdini-style illusions to prevent capture of the object.</p><p>Debris and trash are not to be removed from the site.</p><p>In the event that the object moves, it is to be suspended in an airtight chamber on a high-voltage hanger using electromagnets and remote control software. Any damage caused by this method will only be repaired subjectively with the restoration of the illusion; no actual damage will have occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-504 is a jet engine, manufactured by Pratt & Whitney. It dates from 1979. The object is suspended vertically in a chamber, roughly 3 meters off the ground, with the upper portion of the air intake wrapped in a special type of industrial-grade tarpaulin. The lower end of the intake is open, and there are no visible mechanisms to open it or close it.</p><p>All attempts to disassemble or remove the object have so far failed because no such components exist on any level. Attempts at opening the object through the hole have also failed. They are detected only when they are closing, whereupon they disappear into the hole as if nobody was actually trying to get through it, and reappear when they re-open again.</p><p>Paranormal Effects: On 9/12/1994 at 09:00 PM, D-502 (Researcher H█████) attempted to replicate her successful test for SCP-003-3 by punching through an illusion of a wall holding the object in place and removing it from its suspension point. This attempt was unsuccessful: No wall remained in existence upon which she could punch through. Instead, she found that she had passed through an illusion of a wall and could now walk up and down stairs normally; additionally, although she did not precisely confirm this as yet, D-502 had become disembodied from her body - she was able to see her arm and hand lying there but did not respond to her commands or responses. The rest of her body was nearby but apparently invisible - she could be seen walking around but could not touch or push objects out of existence despite having great strength and being able to throw objects long distances without effort or noise.</p><p>D-502 made her way up several flights of stairs until reaching another chamber with an open hanger and an unused fan pointing inside - this was where we found SCP-504 in 1995. In regular circumstances, it would not have appeared on the floor like that - it would have been suspended in midair so that it wouldn't be visible except partially anywhere you were standing - but I guess [REDACTED] decided to try something different.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
