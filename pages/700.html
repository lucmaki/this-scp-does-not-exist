<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-700</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-700 is to be kept in a steel box containing four large marine animals, two sharks and two rays. The sharks are to be kept individually and the rays conjoined. SCP-700 should always be kept surrounded by saltwater, but in a location far from a population center or any sources of electromagnetic radiation (other than the facility in which it is kept) at all times.</p><p>SCP-700 can be taken out of its containment box with authorization Level 4 personnel who are accompanied by at least two members of security detail. The agents must also wear full radiation protection while approaching the object. The agents will carry the item in a shielded container such as a lead box lined with lead foil. Once they have the object they return it to its original position with no more than 30 minutes passing between their taking the object off the premises and their leaving the area, in order to prevent any potential exposure to contamination.</p><p>A series of 50cm concrete slabs, maintained on site and protected from the elements, are positioned in a 5m wide line along a former rail track that runs through a grove of trees in a heavily wooded area near to where SCP-700 was recovered. As part of ongoing psychological testing, research staff are instructed to use footpaths through and around the grove, including paths that pass within fifty meters of SCP-700's current containment ground zero position. These footpaths must be marked with yellow flags.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-700 is a solid lead weight approximately 14 cm in diameter, with the letters "H. L. A." inscribed on one side in ornate gold paint. The other side is smooth and has been damaged by exposure to chemical agents; it also bears no writing or engraving. The object weighs approximately 3.5 kg, and cannot be split into its four components.</p><p>When SCP-700 has not been moved for at least 15 days, it will begin to radiate gamma radiation steadily across the area thirty meters around it, beginning at the center of its suspected position, directly opposite its original containment location. This radiation manifests itself in two separate streams, one directed straight ahead of the object and another that shoots forth at a rate of 1m/s from each end of the object's shaft. Objects contacted by this radiation will show signs of contamination within 30 seconds, followed by exposure in five minutes. Subjects exposed to this radiation will experience severe swelling in their eyes and mouth, severe nausea and vomiting, dizziness, slurred speech and disorientation – these symptoms are consistent with acute radiation poisoning. Any exposed persons who survive more than 120 minutes will die from massive internal hemorrhaging and organ failure due to blood clotting as well as loss of blood volume caused by dehydration and electrolyte imbalance caused by vomiting during exposure.</p><p>SCP-700 exhibits little variation in its radiation output once set into motion; however since the time it was discovered in ████ ██████ Forest Preserve in California on 07/03/1999 it has only killed 10 test subjects since recovery, all of whom were living close to SCP-700 when it was first discovered.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
