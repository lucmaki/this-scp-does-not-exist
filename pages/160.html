<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-160</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-160 is to be contained in a 20 m x 10 m glass enclosure at Site-77, with a sliding door and climate control system. A video feed of the interior of SCP-160's enclosure must be maintained at all times. SCP-160 may not be moved outside of its enclosure for any reason, and must be fed on a regular basis and provided with fresh water. Any attempts to remove SCP-160 from its enclosure must be approved by two Level 4 personnel, and all personnel entering the level containing SCP-160's enclosure are required to wear full protective clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-160 is an undescribed breed of domesticated dog. DNA testing shows no human, canine, or feline genetic material within its cells. SCP-160's body structure is that of a normal domestic dog, but its skin and brain are composed entirely of regenerative plastic, obscuring all internal organs. When still in its enclosure, SCP-160 has shown no physical signs of aging or injury. The only exception to this was when it sustained a circular wound on its forehead approximately four months ago. Within three days, the wound had completely healed, leaving no trace of the wound or scar.</p><p>SCP-160 has one anomalous property: it can move through solid objects at will. Testing has shown this ability to extend beyond its enclosure; however, SCP-160 is not capable of passing through walls in any direction other than its enclosure wall (or the surface it occupies). While in motion, SCP-160 exhibits no physical impact whatsoever on the object it is moving through, so long as it remains in headfirst motion. SCP-160 will move through any nonoptic material at its speed until it reaches the limits of any medium it may be moving through; however, cameras cannot detect movement past the speed of light. No mechanism short of teleportation has been found to allow SCP-160 to traverse gaps larger than 20 cm wide; however, once inside an enclosure with solid walls and doors, it will use means outside of Foundation knowledge to pass between these obstacles.</p><p>If left unsupervised for more than three minutes, the anomalous properties may manifest themselves in ways related to escape or assault on personnel and/or juveniles within Site 77; this effect will intensify if exposed for longer periods on any given day. In addition, should a canine be introduced into Site 77 without having previously met SCP-160 (through either crossbreeding or breeding from normal dogs), then only that particular dog will exhibit behavior associated with escape/attack scenarios in response to its presence; however, the other dogs present will continue to exhibit normal behavior in their presence. It currently appears that the most recent incident involved two Deltas (dogs trained for explosive detection) and a young child being presented with SCP-160 during a training class; all three were found alive after approximately one hour's time, but severely injured and unconscious with severe burns over most of their bodies. Following these incidents involving juveniles, all staff members are required to carry stun weapons while working with SCP-160.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
