<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-732</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No special containment procedures are to be carried out regarding SCP-732. As the artwork created by these characters is not permanent and can be easily redrawn if need be, no kind of document or relic is to be stored or contained with SCP-732.</p><p>In order to prevent any potential hoaxing, all following individuals who appear on the artwork of SCP-732 should be detained by Foundation personnel and interviewed. In case a real live person has not been identified, any requests to make the work of said individuals available online in order to interview them is to be rejected immediately.</p><p>As to the organization that cares for the welfare of the Subjects of SCP-732, they have been identified as "Wiztoria" by the Subjects themselves. They have been given permission to continue caring for them while Foundation custody remains in effect.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-732 is a series of artwork by 85 unique individuals with the designation "The Subjects of SCP-732". The Subjects of SCP-732 first became interested in each other (as opposed to the various other characters they portrayed) after viewing the animated film, "The Sword of Etheria". Since then, many more individuals have joined this group, who then started to create artwork of their favorite characters in the film.</p><p>Each time a new piece of artwork by the Subjects is created, it takes on a life of its own and comes to be known as an instance of SCP-732. There are currently 85 instances of SCP-732 in existence. It has been determined that at least one instance of SCP-732 will exist until all the existing subjects die or retire from making art, whichever comes first.</p><p>The first instance was produced for reasons unknown and was placed into permanent storage. The next two were discovered floating near several other pieces of artwork produced by the same persons, but contained no information about their creators.</p><p>It is later discovered by Foundation personnel that several of these items belonged to Wiztoria. After conducting further investigation, it transpired that Wiztoria was holding exhibitions for the benefit of the others living under the pain and suffering brought upon them by their cancer treatments until their deaths. They also provided monetary aid to those struggling financially while being treated for cancer.</p><p>After realizing that they didn't need an organization in order to help each other, they decided to set up a charity organization named "Wiztoria" which gave out both financial aid and art works in exchange for small donations made by individuals interested in helping those going through hardships.</p><p>Currently, four additional subjects are consistently inactive with regard to artistic creation at the present time (without giving any reason as to why). These individuals have been allowed to continue their lives under their current circumstances until such time as they can be recalled again by Dr. ████████ for questioning.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
