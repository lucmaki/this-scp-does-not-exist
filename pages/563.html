<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-563</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The perimeter of the habitat of SCP-563 consists of a fence made of barbed wire and two security guards at all times. No more than two individuals are allowed in the habitat at any given time. Any person attempting to leave the habitat is to be quickly removed by one of the security guards. If necessary, a tranquilizer dart may be used on an individual within the habitat for non-emergency transport. All persons found in the habitat without authorization will be detained and questioned.</p><p>Members of MTF Pi-27 have been assigned to identify new individuals in the habitat, as well as retrieve any individuals who have attempted to exit or contact outside entities via radio. Information has also been collected on other sites where black caribou have been seen, including:</p><p>To date, no evidence has emerged that SCP-563 itself is capable of communicating, but Site 79 believes it is possible. Efforts are currently underway to locate and capture SCP-563-1 instances before they leave the site to prevent their escape.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-563 is a small, uninhabited island off the northwest coast of mainland Canada. Due to its remote location, little research has been conducted on SCP-563. The following information is based on the notes kept by Site 79 staff.</p><p>SCP-563 appears to be an uninhabited island composed primarily of black rock and ice, but several long paths of grass have been found leading across the island's northern side. These paths are narrow enough to fit one person at a time, and are usually only wide enough for one or two persons to walk abreast. The grass is perpetually frozen due to SCP-563's cold climate, allowing it to remain intact.</p><p>The grass itself appears to be black in color, and features a texture that appears similar to hair. No animals have been observed living in the grass; however, it has been theorized that SCP-563 may have existed since prehistoric times when cavemen came here to hunt black caribou (SCP-563-1 instances).</p><p>Several groups of black caribou have been spotted near the edges of SCP-563's perimeter fence, most likely escaping from nearby forests via SCP-563. A total of five SCP-563-1 instances have been discovered so far:</p><p>A security camera covering a large piece of land surrounding SCP-563 has recorded footage in which two human figures can be seen approaching SCP-563 and entering one of the paths through the grass. No further evidence has emerged indicating that these individuals belong to any government agency or military organization. They were reported missing by their spouses during this period.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
