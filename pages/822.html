<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-822</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-822 are to be stored in Containment Locker 27 at Site-██. No fewer than 50 instances of SCP-822 are under Foundation control.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-822 is a set of 11 keys, each labeled with a different number. Instances of SCP-822 display no anomalous properties until 2021, when each instance becomes inert and begins to manifest itself as a usable key for a nearby object or building. The number printed on the key matches the number printed in ink on the object it unlocks. All anomalous properties are stored within the object itself and are not transferable, though SCP-822 instances retain all their properties after immobility and storage.</p><p>SCP-822 has been measured to unlock objects 1 km away. A simple container containing SCP-822 instances was moved through 1/3rd of an available space within Site-██, before becoming demanifest inside of another site ██ kilometers away, requiring an additional ██ kilometers of travel to rediscover the original site. For approximate values on its volume, refer to Experiment Log 522.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
