<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-597</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-597 is to be stored at Site ██ in a standard Safe-class containment locker. Any personnel with Level 4 clearance are permitted to view SCP-597 without the use of special clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-597 is a pocket flashlight of unknown brand and manufacture. SCP-597 weighs 0.25 kg and measures 8 by 3 cm. Upon removing the battery, no LEDs or other electrical components are present in the case. When an object is placed within SCP-597's beam, the object will disappear from its normal location and float at a distance of 1 meter above its original position.</p><p>SCP-597 was recovered from an abandoned military facility while investigating reports of anomalous phenomena connected with said facility. The reported anomalous activity ceased after Foundation agents infiltrated the facility and seized SCP-597.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
