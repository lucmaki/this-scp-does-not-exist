<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-30</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-30 is to be held in a temperature-controlled, oxygenated environment, 1.5 m high at all times, for further study of its behavior. SCP-30 is not to be disturbed.</p><p>As a result of existing in a tightly controlled environment and being an only 'predominantly' aquatic creature, SCP-30 is not considered to be at risk of becoming lost or going extinct as most other SCPs are. Instead, it is in the researchers' best interest and the Foundation's to encourage public interest in SCP-30 and its study and containment. This may involve social media campaigns, scientific publications, press releases, etc.</p><p>Any documentation discovered, regardless of source or method of preservation, may be used by the Foundation to further its goals concerning SCP-30.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-30 is a single celled organism found in the Pacific Ocean. SCP-30, while biologically identifiable and functionally similar to other members of its species, possesses distinctly 'bioelectrical' traits and behaviors.</p><p>SCP-30 consumes oxygen suspended in water and can survive at depths up to 1000 meters. At this depth, it will voluntarily withdraw into an underground tubular structure or burrow for periods lasting up to several weeks. SCP-30 does not breathe normally but instead excretes and absorbs oxygen from the water through pores in the outer shell and through its dermal layer.</p><p>When exposed to atmospheric pressure above this depth, SCP-30 grows a protective exoskeleton consisting of both calcium carbonate and chitin hardened with calcium nitrate. During this time, SCP-30 enters a state of suspended animation. In this state, it begins to show signs of electrochemical activity.</p><p>SCP-30's exoskeleton will rupture under pressure and pull outwards, allowing for greater expansion of the organism and allowing the organism to resurface if necessary. Embedded within its arms are tendrils able to draw in ambient oxygen from the surrounding water and absorb it through modified capillaries that have been constructed from calcium nitrate.</p><p>This hydrostatic action also allows SCP-30 to retain its ability to suspend itself in air indefinitely during daytime hours. These arms also contain a series of bioelectrical cells which produce an electrical field capable of repelling any fish that attempt to touch it or approach it closely. This field is nonlinear, generating an electrodynamic force of roughly 300 g when fully charged (though the exact amount varies depending on variables such as size). Testing shows that animals attempting to pass through SCP-30's lightning bolt form a path through it at more than 3 times the speed they would normally travel over their own bodies.</p><p>Extensive testing has shown that this 'lightning bolt' form is extremely conductive and dense enough to act as a powerful repellent against all forms of biological matter. It is theorized that if SCP-30 was placed in an electrolyte solution (such as seawater) rather than standing water, these properties would not be as pronounced and it may in fact be easier for SCP-30 to interact with living organisms since… well… nothing can stand against it! Reducing SCP-30's water content will cause the organism to show fewer effects related to having one of its most potent defense mechanisms disabled.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
