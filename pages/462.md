<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-462</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-462 is currently being housed in a standard containment cell (2.3m x 2m x 1.5m) located within Site-77's anomalous objects wing. The room is to be kept at all times empty of anything not directly associated with the chamber's functions. Personnel are not permitted to enter SCP-462's containment cell unless testing it for safety.</p><p>Daily cleaning has been assigned to the rest of Site-77 and is to be performed by approved members of security and research staff. All cleaners must have been issued with a Level 4 Clearance before approaching SCP-462's containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-462 is a standard, unadorned white cell with an interior measuring 2.3m x 2m x 1.5m. The walls and ceiling of the cell are made from a non-anomalous material, however the floor is comprised of a fibrous material composed of human hair. SCP-462's interior temperature ranges between 38 °C to 44 °C and the humidity from 0% to 98%.</p><p>SCP-462 does not contain any unusual features and displays no anomalous properties when in isolation. However, once an individual begins interacting with SCP-462 in any manner, it will change its properties based on their actions.</p><p>Selecting or moving SCP-462's floor will cause the floor to fill with hair. Once filled, the hair will begin dissolving in a liquid state. At this point, SCP-462's floor will become slippery and hazardous to the subject's footing. Any contact with the floor will result in severe lacerations and bruising on those who step upon it. Further attempts made to move SCP-462's floor results in immediate ejection from the cell by unknown forces. The hair will remain within SCP-462 until either:</p><p>Any attempt to move or interact with SCP-462 accounts for [DATA EXPUNGED]. If a subject is removed from SCP-462, they will die immediately; as SCP-462 will continue to degrade at its current rate until nothing remains except for a pool of water.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
