<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-890</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has placed a 24/7 guard over SCP-890. The area is surrounded by a 1 km perimeter fence, and overseen by the KVN-65 Rangers before being transferred to Site-59's security department. SCP-890 is kept in an isolated, fenced containment unit.</p><p>In addition, the Pacific Maritime Militia and the FBI are tasked with maintaining SCP-890 at bay. The Pacific Maritime Militia are to warn vessels of late September (when SCP-890 appears) to alter their course away from SCP-890 as far as possible. The FBI are to track and follow vessels entering Bering Strait until they pass SCP-890, which occurs in early October each year.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-890 is a large mass of several hundred male Grey Wolves, Kodiak Bears (Ursus arctos middendorffi), and other subspecies of Ursus living on the land bridge between Alaska and Russia.</p><p>SCP-890 appear between September 22nd and October 2nd. During this time, SCP-890 will stand still, sometimes sitting in a bipedal position for several hours at a time. No food or water is given to SCP-890; it will feed on human flesh directly from passing vessels or use its claws to rip open the boats. When any vessels are caught by SCP-890's approach, the fleet will stop and drop their anchors to avoid SCP-890's attack. Ships will then attempt to escape using their engines in order to outrun the SCP-890 while maintaining enough distance that they cannot be attacked.</p><p>While SCP-890 appears stationary, it typically hovers over one point on land and displays some degree of movement despite appearing solid. When it approaches a vessel, it will make vocalizations which can vary from bear growls to high pitched screams. The sounds emitted by SCP-890 vary based on the type of meat being consumed by SCP-890; human flesh causes SCP-890 to scream in pain, while fish causes SCP-890 to howl.</p><p>In addition to displaying its anomalous properties during September and October, SCP-890 redirects its anomalous characteristics in response to the presence of nearby objects or beings. If the proximity of an object is significantly reduced or removed from the ground beneath its feet, SCP-890 will momentarily bend over and return its attention from the vessel towards where it was previously located. If a boat moves further away from where it saw the object or person last, it will spring back into action regardless of whether human flesh was consumed overnight.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
