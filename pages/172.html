<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-172</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the meagre dimensions and rugged surface of SCP-172, no surface layer is allowed to develop any appreciable erosion. The affected areas are to be monitored constantly; any traces of erosion are to be repaired immediately. Any organisms present in the affected area are to be removed or relocated.</p><p>Due to their size, moving SCP-172 away from the edge of such a large lake is impossible. Therefore, a perimeter fence has been constructed around SCP-172 and is to be monitored by security personnel at all times. Any personnel caught violating this protocol will receive the standard punishment for unauthorized entry into Site-119, along with a permanent ban on re-entering.</p><p>No exploration of SCP-172 without prior approval of Dr ████ and an escort team of two personnel is permitted. If possible, exploration should take place during winter months when water levels are lowest. Lights should not be left on overnight as they will increase sedimentation rates.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-172 is an artificial pond with an area of approximately 50m by 100m, covering approximately 8m of depth. The pond appears to be roughly circular in shape. In addition, water has shown unusual light refraction properties similar to that of water containing suspended particulate matter (i.e., raindrops and other particles).</p><p>The surface of SCP-172 remains completely clear and transparent at all times. However, SCP-172 possesses anomalous properties when illuminated by lighting fixtures with either incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes. When illuminated this way, SCP-172 will have the appearance of a human face. Analysis of this phenomenon has shown that the effect is temporary; as soon as the light source is turned off, or if the illumination remains for a prolonged period, the effect disappears and SCP-172 returns back to its normal state.</p><p>SCP-172 was discovered in ████ on 11/██/20██ when Agent █████ walked across one of the lakeshore paths and observed the aforementioned effect. Agent █████ reported this to Dr ████ who was studying SCP-172 nearby. Within two days, a team of Foundation agents had formed and were studying how to deal with the issue.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
