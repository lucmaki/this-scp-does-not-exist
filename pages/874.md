<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-874</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Regional authorities have been notified of the appearance of SCP-874, and advise citizens to take measures to prevent it from entering urban areas. Civilians with an affinity for water sports, including kayaks, are encouraged to travel through or near SCP-874 as little as possible. Suspicious individuals with similar hobbies may be detained or given amnestics before being transported to Safe SCP-874-A.</p><p>Instances of SCP-874 are to be monitored around the clock by Foundation agents stationed in neighboring regions. When SCP-874 enters urban areas, special containment procedures are enacted with the assistance of local law enforcement. Any civilians who enter SCP-874 should be transported to the nearest city by Foundation agents while the local mental health system is contacted in order to help any affected civilians that have entered a catatonic state.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-874 is an anomalous geographical phenomenon consisting of a large body of water that only exists in Louisiana's Red River and its tributaries, which also include the Atchafalaya, Cane River, and Amite River. The basin of SCP-874 varies in size and shape over time, but during its first 80 years, it expanded at a rate of approximately 2 km per decade. Entities (hereafter referred to as SCP-874-A) observed within the area of SCP-874 are generated by copies of people who have traveled through or into the area. All instances of SCP-874-A are sentient in nature and show some degree of independent thought when observed.</p><p>Instances of SCP-874-A will attempt to reach populated areas where they can be safe. Inevitably, they return to SCP-874 if unable to secure a residence. Due to their desire for safety and denial of the need for safety from their own lives, survivors are not able to effectively describe what occurs when an instance comes into contact with human life, other than stating that all individuals become paralysed for up to several minutes before being lost in space for several hours. Partially recovered instances have reported similar descriptions regarding their interactions with nonliving objects such as trees and buildings.</p><p>SCP-874 was first detected by Foundation researchers interrogating a prisoner from Vinton Correctional Facility. Several months after his escape from prison, one of the subject's family members claimed to hear strange sounds emanating from a typical southern river in the town where they lived. Despite searching several locations claimed by the family member, no trace could be found of the mysterious entity; this led researchers to conduct a full containment investigation on the Red River Basin following reports of two entities entering New Orleans at separate times without leaving any trace.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
