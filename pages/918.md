<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-918</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-918 is located in a research station in [REDACTED] which is to be disguised as a Buddhist monastery. Security is to be maintained by site staff only. No civilians are to ever visit SCP-918. Any individuals who enter the area must be treated as hostile and detained immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-918 is the designation for an anomalous group of historical figures, collectively designated SCP-918-A. These individuals were famous during 1915-1919 in China, but have not been historically documented since. The list of known subjects is as follows:</p><p>All subjects but [DATA EXPUNGED] are confirmed to have died by the end of 1926. Records indicate that all subjects had a significant presence in the media at the time of their death. Before their demise, all subjects were considered highly important community leaders and philanthropists.</p><p>Subjects are found together in a special research station in the mountains which they used as a base of operations. Subjects appear to have no awareness of each other's existence, except that they recall events from the beginning of their careers up until their death, and appear to believe themselves to be unrelated individuals.</p><p>SCP-918 is currently engaged in negotiations with Foundation agents to allow it to relocate to a secure location where it may live out its life in peace. It has expressed an interest in being granted a higher classification than Keter status and retirement from Foundation operations.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
