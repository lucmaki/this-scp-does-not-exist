<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-897</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-897 are to be housed in a single isolation chamber within Site-76. Only two remote cameras are to be installed in the containment area; any additional assets may be acquired by Foundation agents posing as local officials. All instances of SCP-897 are to be fed once per week.</p><p>Should an instance of SCP-897 attempt to escape its cell, it is to be moved to a separate isolation chamber for further observation. Should an instance of SCP-897 begin to violently attack its only human contact, any personnel attempting to approach the area is to be terminated immediately via proximity controlled weapon fire.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-897 is the collective designation for a group of seven humanoid entities appearing in the form of males of African descent. All instances of SCP-897 will display bizarre behaviors towards and towards each other, with members of the group attempting to care for each other by performing various tasks.</p><p>SCP-897 possess unusually high levels of intelligence, with all instances capable of both verbal and written communication. All instances of SCP-897 claim to be servants to a humanoid entity referred to as "God". However, attempts to interview any instance have failed due to their inability to understand English.</p><p>In addition to their claims of servitude, SCP-897 describes a highly religious community consisting only of it, God and several dozen other individuals. Several notable members are able to understand English and are able to answer interview questions though most will attempt to talk over the interviewer rather than through them.</p><p>The following list represents the names assigned to prominent members. Additional members are referred to within SCP-897 containment documentation:</p><p>SCP-897 was discovered within a house in [REDACTED] on April 7th 1992 after local law enforcement raided its residence in response to reports of multiple livestock deaths. During this raid, SCP-897 engaged local police in increasingly violent behavior; when no agents could respond, an instance fled from its home and entered into nearby woods where it was detained by Foundation agents. A single additional instance was located later that day in an abandoned warehouse which had previously been noted as a site for Satanic rituals by local law enforcement.(See Incident Report 45.)</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
