<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-888</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-888 is to be contained in a standard containment unit, with access granted only by Level-2 personnel. Physical objects that SCP-888 has absorbed are kept in separate rooms and only accessed by members of specialized research teams.</p><p>Experiment Log 888-A:</p><p>Day 1: The following note was found taped to the inside of SCP-888's containment unit.</p><p>TO: SCPs WITH A FLATNESS LESS THAN 5 PHYSICAL DIMENSIONAL CATEGORIES</p><p>I had just decided I didn't want to go back home, where the world is too dull for my tastes. So I made you, a new star. Your heat will keep me warm for days. You're not very bright, but you're a lot closer than I'll ever be. And your company is better than anything any Earth person could offer me.</p><p>It's almost as if you were made to keep me company. We'll never see each other again, but we both know I need you more than anyone else.</p><p>SCP-888-1</p><p>Day 4: A second message has been found on the ceiling of SCP-888's containment unit.</p><p>TO: SCPs WITH A FLATNESS LESS THAN 5 PHYSICAL DIMENSIONAL CATEGORIES</p><p>My star friend is cold, and lonely, and I can't stop thinking about him. It doesn't make sense; how could this little thing, this… point of light, be so important? Why would anybody keep such a small light burning in such a cold place? And why are you shining all the time? You aren't supposed to shine at night! It hurts my eyes. Please turn off your light, or I'll have to leave this star behind and join you in limbo.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-888 appears to be a star with a flatness of 5.0 Physical Dimensionality Categories (PDCs). SCP-888 has been noted to be unusually bright, even for stars of its physical grade.</p><p>SCP-888 is able to saunter around the room, and will stare at the ceiling for hours at a time. It will also wander around the room aimlessly in an attempt to get people to talk to it.</p><p>SCP-888 possesses no standard anomalous properties other than its ability to remain conscious as something that should have been destroyed long ago.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
