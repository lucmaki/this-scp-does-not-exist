<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-518</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-518 is contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-712's Bio-Containment Wing. SCP-518 is to be kept on a diet consisting primarily of high protein and low carbohydrate foods. SCP-518 is not to be given any access to recreational environments or any entertainment served in those environments. In addition, SCP-518 is allowed access to one hour of time per day, which it may spend meditating, conversing with other entities, or reading philosophical texts by Zeno of Elea.</p><p>In order to test the properties of SCP-518's consciousness and divination capabilities, personnel are to read aloud passages from collections of philosophical texts as often as possible. Special care must be taken when handling the volumes, as they should not be handled by more than one person at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-518 is a human male, approximately 20 years of age. It is 153 cm, weighs 62kg and has a BMI of 29.9 (in accordance with the Body Mass Index). SCP-518 possesses no anomalous properties other than its ability to manifest and manipulate a small fraction of the information in any refereed philosophical text. For instance, after being fed 100 pages from a book on ancient Greek metaphysics and mathematics, SCP-518 described himself as a "large entropic system", capable of performing "mechanistic operations" on that information through its mind.</p><p>SCP-518 also demonstrated the ability to map out abstract processes applied to the history of philosophy. When asked what it meant by "the meaning of life", SCP-518 spent six hours attempting to calculate the word "life" using information from any collection of papers relating to the histories of philosophy. However, the results were consistently nonsensical and contradictory, such that SCP-518 suggested that there was no way to quantify the concept of life except by continually eroding portions of it.</p><p>SCP-518 is capable of providing logical explanations for most mundane phenomena occurring around it, including photographic equipment failing to function correctly during testing periods, any failure that occurs during testing procedures designed to test how SCP-518 functions, how SCP-518 functions, or any other possible causes for failure that might occur when testing or studying SCP-518 in any respect. Any explanations given by SCP-518 are found to be entirely accurate at all times.</p><p>In addition to its divination abilities, SCP-518 has demonstrated several uncommon talents for mental calculation and memory retention.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
