<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-941</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Directly outside of Site-██'s outer perimeter, SCP-940 is to be kept in a containment bunker capable of housing a maximum of ten (10) members of a D-Class personnel team at any given time. The entrance to SCP-940's containment bunker is to be protected by two (2) guards at all times, who are permitted to use lethal force against any hostile entity that attempts to breach the perimeter.</p><p>In the event SCP-940 is needed for use within Sites-██ or -███, an alternate containment facility is to be constructed. In this scenario, the facility housing SCP-940 is to be guarded by no less than five (5) armed guards at all times; additionally, any additional security personnel on the site are to be equipped with SCPs-940-A and -940-B, which are to be stowed when not in use.</p><p>In cases where it appears possible for SCP-940 to escape from containment, it must be forced back into the facility immediately via methods approved by Site Head Researcher Doctor ██████ ██████. Personnel authorised by Senior Researcher ██████████████ are to liaise with Doctor ██████ on all such matters.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-940 is an anomaly related to the popular video game series, "Resident Evil". The name of SCP-940 stems from the commonly used item in the series: the Proximity Alert Device (PAD), which is a device used by all members of the "B.O.W." and "G.I.S." units of Umbrella Corporation to alert nearby personnel to the presence of hostile entities. SCP-940, as documented by Umbrella Corporation, can be activated remotely; but the effects are not immediately apparent - when activated, SCP-940 releases a high-frequency audible sound that can be heard throughout a small radius from its activation point.</p><p>After thirty (30) seconds have elapsed since activation, a large volume of small projectiles are released from SCP-940 over a period of thirty (30) seconds to a maximum volume of approximately 190 decibels; this process occurs in succession until all projectiles have been successfully destroyed. This process has no effect on entities that were previously rendered non-hostile by SCP-940's activation - however, if any such entity remains hostile following this process, then it will instead release several additional projectiles at high speed directly towards the source of SCP-940's activation until the entire area has been cleared.</p><p>The particular method that SCP-940 uses appears to be random - while some test subjects report hearing gunfire or similar weapons being used during this process, other test subjects have reported only seeing large quantities of confetti or paper being thrown throughout the area affected. Any bodies that are affected also appear to explode violently at regular intervals following this process; these explosions inflict significant damage to nearby structures - personnel on site report seeing these explosions as sounding like an explosion occurring in a warehouse filled with liquids or air.</p><p>All instances within two hundred (200) meters of SCP-940's containment area feature aggressive behavior consistent with those outlined above; additionally, they will travel directly towards any source of SCP-940's activation. In testing, it has been shown that any living being even slightly outside this radius will be affected - there is no recorded instance where any living being was unaffected.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
