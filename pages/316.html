<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-316</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-316 is to be kept in a Standard Containment Locker at Site 43.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-316 is a white, vinyl refrigerator magnet in the shape of a small goldenrod. The addition of a piece of paper to SCP-316 opens up a feature by incorporating the words "For Goldenrod" written in blue ink. As of yet, this feature has never been tested.</p><p>When SCP-316 is attached to a person’s refrigerator, they will begin experiencing vivid nightmares relating to their demise at the hands of a black panther named ‘Goldenrod’, who invariably appears as either one or two black cats. The more times SCP-316 is used, the more intensely their dreams will become and the harder it is to convince them they are actually dreaming.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
