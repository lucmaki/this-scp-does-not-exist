<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A cover story has been released indicating the suspected disappearance of SCP-1, in order to hide its anomalous nature. Any reports of SCP-1 found outside Foundation facilities are to be taken as unrelated</p><p>SCP-1 must never be approached by non-Foundation personnel, and Foundation personnel are not allowed to come close to it for any reason. Any personnel approaching on their own initiative are to be given amnestics immediately following discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1 is a large, abstractly shaped building with no discernible entry or exit. At any time there may be as many as 730 instances of SCP-1 in existence at any given time. SCP-1 were originally known as "The Infinite Building" in the early 1990s, belonging to the artist ██████ ███████████ (aka █████████████).</p><p>SCP-1 changes shape and appearance at random, although this change seems to be fairly consistent depending on how long it remains in an inactive state. When in active states of both current and previous forms, SCP-1 has the ability to generate reports by writing on its walls. These reports are taken as being written by various anomalous individuals and entities, including members of the SCP Foundation itself.</p><p>It is believed that the original form of SCP-1 was a seven hour tour of SCP ██████████'s art studio, which was redeveloped into a more permanent facility at some point around 2005.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
