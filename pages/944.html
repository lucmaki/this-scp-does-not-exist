<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-944</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-944 is kept in a refrigerated storage locker in the Site-19 animal quarantine facility. Staff who will be exposed to SCP-944 are not to eat any animal products or feed that has been drawn from outside of the facility for the duration of their stay.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-944 is a single piece of flesh, approximately 1 meter long and 3 cm wide. SCP-944 is perishable and will begin to rot at roughly 35 degrees Celsius regardless of the surrounding temperature.</p><p>SCP-944's anomalous quality is expressed most strongly when it is directly connected to the circulatory system of another animal. When such a connection is established, SCP-944 will immediately degenerate into a series of strips of varying thickness and material that are individually capable of supporting the life processes of an adult human.</p><p>When this occurs, the strips will proceed to eject from the new host's circulatory system as normal and make their way toward the nearest piece of raw meat, alive or otherwise. In time, if no new connections are made to other pieces of meat, these strips will reunite with SCP-944 and produce a new instance thereof.</p><p>The exact nature of how these pieces recall their original form is currently unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
