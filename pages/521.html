<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-521</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-521 is currently housed within Site-72's vacuum-sealed containment chamber. Under no circumstances should personnel work in close proximity to SCP-521.</p><p>SCP-521 requires extensive daily maintenance, and must be refilled with venom at least once a week. Contact between personnel and SCP-521 is prohibited except for readout and replenishment purposes.</p><p>Personnel assigned to reading out SCP-521's readings are to be equipped with Class-A gas masks and surgical gloves.</p><p>Any questions regarding SCP-521 are to be directed towards Dr. Gadianton of Site-72. In the event that Dr. Gadianton has been neutralized, contact with SCP-521 is permitted only through Dr. Kindred.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-521 is a spherical object approximately 40 cm in diameter.</p><p>SCP-521's anomalous properties manifest when it is within a radius of 30 m. It was originally discovered in ████████, ██████████ in 1971, ostensibly attached to the city's power supply. SCP-521 re-appeared when repair crews severed power to affected areas, and after testing confirmed its non-anomalous nature.</p><p>SCP-521 is sentient, intelligent, sapient, and has demonstrated ability to communicate with humans. It is currently classified as an Euclid phenomenon due to its lack of anomalous properties.</p><p>When placed upon a power source, SCP-521 will begin drawing ethereal matter from the same. This process is extremely taxing on SCP-521's brain; hence its frequent use of venom as fuel. Upon reaching a quota set by SCP-521, further electrical usage will result in the creation of additional instances of SCP-521 (referred to as "seedlings"), which are autonomous objects that seek out sources of electrical energy for themselves. Seedlings are sapient, self aware, and capable of independent thought; however they do not extend their consciousness beyond the radius of their host object. Seedlings cannot produce their own venom; they consume physical entities that have already produced venom.</p><p>When performing maintenance on SCP-521 each week, personnel are to be equipped with Class-A gas masks and surgical gloves when near SCP-521; only after the fitting of these supplies is the subject allowed to contact SCP-521 directly. Any personnel assigned to reading out SCP-521's readings should be equipped with similar supplies via Full Metal Body Armor v2.0 before exiting containment chamber.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
