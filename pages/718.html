<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-718</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-718 is located in an inaccessible vault at Site-77. The installation of 518 "Barber Pole" barriers around the perimeter of the perimeter of SCP-718 are to be rotated every 14 days to ensure that no individuals attempt to enter SCP-718 without authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-718 is a rectangular structure built of reinforced concrete, measuring approximately 1.6m in width and 2.4m in height. The walls are painted a light brown color with no discernible patterns. The floor of SCP-718 consists of a series of large drain holes that extend from the center towards the outer perimeter of SCP-718 (see installation log).</p><p>Any individual who enters SCP-718 without authorization will experience sensory feedback from within the structure. The sensation is described as a "vibrating hum" through the head and neck. At this point, the subject will be unable to close their eyes or open their mouth. Subsequent attempts to exit SCP-718 will result in the subject's collapse on the ground, comatose until death. No subjects have ever survived herding large numbers of these individuals inside SCP-718 (see containment log).</p><p>The air within SCP-718 is not breathable, despite not being obviously toxic or hazardous. There are no detectable sources of oxygen within SCP-718, and subjects have found themselves unable to breathe due to lack of oxygen consumption by vital organs starting about 15 minutes after entering SCP-718. Once all vital signs cease, subjects will expire where they lie until removal from SCP-718.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
