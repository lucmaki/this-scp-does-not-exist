<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-33</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-33 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. It is not currently permitted to be taken out of its chamber by any persons not assigned as a test subject for purposes of investigation of its properties. Three pairs of earplugs are also to be provided to personnel working with it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-33 is an item manufactured by ████████ Institute of Surgical Technology, Inc. The object is a pair of earplugs (SCP-33 designators SCP-33-1 and SCP-33-2) which, when worn with the convex side facing outward, can achieve the capacity to control a ship weighing approximately 6 tons and crewed by two personnel for periods ranging from 15 minutes to several hours.</p><p>Regardless of whether the convex side faces inward or outward, the object will not function under ambient temperatures below 0°C. Testing has shown that it must be used in conjunction with one's ears at temperatures of at least 10°C in order to be effective: prior to testing, the ear canal should be cleared of debris and wax roughly the size of a small pea. The object should be placed on the affected ear and tightened up to create almost complete occlusion.</p><p>If no individuals are present on a ship when its exterior temperature drops below 5°C, the crew members' mental state will begin to deteriorate if they remain on duty beyond 8 hours; individuals will become confused and disoriented, often beginning monologues about what their duties are or what the name of their ship is. However, if individuals are on board a ship when its exterior reaches 5°C or lower, they will begin to manifest symptoms consistent with high doses of class A amnestics. These effects abate when sufficient time has elapsed since exterior ventilation was stopped. Members of test crews have been noted to cease being coherent entirely after 24 hours at these temperatures; later tests have succeeded in keeping them aware longer than 30 days.</p><p>It is currently unknown whether this effect is carried over to other ships or vessels; however, it has been demonstrated more than once that loss of contact between a command vessel and its crew occurs only when both are inside SCP-33's effective range. This suggests that loss of contact may result only when both vessels are within SCP-33's range.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
