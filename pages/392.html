<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-392</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All records of SCP-392 are to be destroyed. Any site containing research into SCP-392 is to be quarantined and the affected personnel administered Class A amnestics. The elderly members of Foundation staff have been granted indefinite leave of absence.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-392 was a proprietary chemical cleaning solution produced by the ████ █████ Company. SCP-392 is strongly acidic, with a pH of 1, and is an effective cleaner for most household items. When exposed to air, SCP-392 will form a water soluble foam. This foam is highly corrosive upon contact with skin or hair, causing temporary alopecia and dry brittle hair growth as well as constant pain and irritation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
