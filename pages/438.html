<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-438</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-438 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-77, within the Research Wing. A light source is to be kept continuously on SCP-438 at all times; this is to be removed for testing purposes only.</p><p>All testing of SCP-438 requires written approval from both the current Head Researcher and the current Site Administrator; such approval may be granted with or without notification.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-438 is a blush pink lip gloss, of unknown brand, manufactured in Germany. The packaging features the Goldilocks logo and an image of a woman in modern dress holding the container. Analysis has revealed no chemical components other than lip gloss; the label does not list any ingredients or active components.</p><p>All instances of SCP-438 have been found to contain traces of forty different women, with their ages ranging from newborns to elderly women. Testing has shown that the identities of these women are randomly assigned; they do not appear to be significantly influenced by the makeup of the subject.</p><p>When an individual applies SCP-438 on their lips and then places their mouth close to another person's mouth, the subject will be able to speak normally and make intelligible sounds for about ten seconds. This speech is often incoherent or irrelevant, and usually appears as a string of words whose meanings could be understood by any person who knew the language being spoken.</p><p>While SCP-438 has no known effect on spoken languages other than English, it has been observed that subjects can understand and speak foreign languages fluently when using SCP-438; this effect seems to not occur when a subject is alone.</p><p>Instances of SCP-438 do not appear to be affected by normal oiling or saliva, nor are instances affected by beverages or other liquids (such as saliva or oil) unless these liquids are taken internally. In addition, both oral use and inhalation do not affect how long a subject can speak with SCP-438 worn on their lips; however, use of SCP-438 prevents taste perception while wearing it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
