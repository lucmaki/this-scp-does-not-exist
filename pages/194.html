<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-194</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation's Berlin bunker has been constructed to contain SCP-194. Current plans are for this site to be heavily fortified and to serve as the primary inter-Security coordination center for dealing with the particulars of SCP-194. A full staff of research personnel is assigned to study SCP-194 and any other information regarding it.</p><p></p><p>SCP-194 is contained in a reinforced steel cage, measuring 1 m x 1 m x 0.7 m, suspended by cables from a crane mounted on the roof of the bunker. The cage is equipped with an internal communications array and monitoring equipment, only one entrance is to be opened at any time, and none of the equipment may be removed without consent from two Level 3 researchers.</p><p>The location of SCP-194 is to remain secure at all times. All personnel entering SCP-194 must wear approved SCPs containment garb that include anti-radiation shielding (the shielding should be replaced every day), and be accompanied by at least one armed guard.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-194 is an anomalous construct that can be described as two humanoid figures (hereafter SCP-194-1 and SCP-194-2) with their heads connected via a flexible steel neck. The central body consists of various steel and aluminum plates, many of which bear the image of a star within a circle. SCP-194 has no apparent motor or control system beyond the reflexive twitching of its mouths and eyes, but it obeys human commands by means of what appears to be telekinesis.</p><p>SCP-194 displays a degree of intelligence and self-preservation, having built itself a steel cage and developed a crude language based on the visual symbols carved into its plates. It also owes allegiance to no government or leader, but displays habitually belligerent behavior towards all non-anomalous humans. It responds to both friendly and hostile behavior with verbal taunts and threats.</p><p>In cases where its cage has been opened in an unprotected location, SCP-194 has escaped its containment more than twelve times; however, none of these instances have survived longer than three weeks. As soon as escape becomes feasible, it will kill any non-anomalous humans it encounters.</p><p>History: </p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
