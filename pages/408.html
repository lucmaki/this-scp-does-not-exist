<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-408</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-408 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-19. Only personnel working on SCP-408 are to enter the containment locker containing it. Any photographs of SCP-408 taken by unauthorized parties are to be immediately confiscated and destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-408 is the collective designation of a group of photographs depicting two individuals who closely match the description of a man named █████ ████████, AKA "The Redwood Strangler". SCP-408 was found in a storage locker in [REDACTED] on June 3, 2006, and containment procedures were enacted immediately.</p><p>When SCP-408 was released into the wild, it was observed by police in █████, CA. One of the people photographed holding a red sign reading "I ♥ REDWOOD" so closely resembled █████ ████████ that he was detained for further investigation. The other photographed individual was identified as Norman Jay Turpin - co-owner of Plantation Estates in █████, CA.</p><p>After continued investigation, it was determined that several areas north and south of █████ had been targeted by serial killer "The Redwood Strangler", who had killed ██ people in █████ between May 18 and October 3, 2006. It was eventually discovered that Coach Lee Duncan, a local college professor and camp counselor at Camp ██████████, led an ongoing campaign to raise funds to build a statue of "The Redwood Strangler" in front of the campus greenhouses (see Addendum 408-1).</p><p>Dr. Vinci: Is the person you're describing someone you know?</p><p>Agent Hosti… Jackson: Yes sir. We all remember him from back in our school days. He used to be a pretty popular guy around here. Won lots of races at camp and stuff like that - he's just about as talented as they come when it comes to running.</p><p>Dr. Vinci: So this man… murdered people at camp? What kind of man does that? Why would anybody want to do something like that?</p><p>Agent Jackson: I don't know if he wanted to do it or not… I mean those poor kids just wanted to have fun at camp… but somehow I don't think he cared much about any of them after he started killing them. He seemed more interested in his own sport than anything else… but we all know what happens when you start taking yourself too seriously…</p><p>[…] [Jay has been talking for some time with Dr Vinci.]</p><p>Dr. Vinci: Mr Turpin – are you aware that there are still people out there who believe you are responsible for these murders? Even my boss wants me to make contact with you in hopes of finding out more information regarding this case. Please do not hesitate to answer any questions we might have. We can swear you in as an official witness if necessary…</p><p>Agent Jackson: Things weren't exactly normal back then… but everybody knew what happened to those kids… you couldn't just ignore it all these years! I'm sorry we spent so long refusing to believe somebody like Norman could do something like this! I lost friends because we didn't believe him; I even lost my job over this whole situation! But now we've got proof! We can put him away once and for all! It's almost funny how easy it is for us now - maybe things would have been different if he came forward when he first did? Nobody probably would have believed him back then… but now look at all the attention everyone's giving him! None of it would have happened if he hadn't wanted the attention so badly…</p><p>Dr. Vinci: Thank you for your time Mr Turpin… is there anything else you'd like to tell us before we leave? Anything else at all?</p><p>Agent Jackson: Just one thing – Mr Turpin - when they take away your freedom and your life over something like this, don't be sad or scared or anything - because all you're losing is your right to be free anymore. There's nothing left for you behind it anyway - no more running or climbing trees with friends or eating candy bars at 4 o'clock in the morning when nobody's around - because once they drag you off in handcuffs and throw you away into their deepest prison cell and lock the door behind you there's not gonna be another chance for you to feel alive again ever again.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
