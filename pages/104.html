<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-104</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A manor in █████████, CA has been purchased by the Foundation. The Foundation's front, known as Custer Manor, is maintained in the present by a group of staff.</p><p>The manor building is to be maintained as the appearance of a residence, with the exception of the basement and underneath it. The basement, currently bricked up, is to serve as the containment area for SCP-104, hereafter referred to as 'the Nuthouse'.</p><p>Any personnel moving through the manor are to wear full security gear at all times. Personnel are to be briefed on what to expect after entering SCP-104, and upon exiting are to not speak about it for at least one month.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-104 is an abandoned house located in █████████, CA. SCP-104 was purchased by the Foundation in 1944 and has had no recorded entry or presence until ████████, 1952. At this time, a man named ███████ ███████ entered SCP-104 and several days later died of starvation.</p><p>SCP-104 has no apparent entrance. It is described as having thirty rooms, all with different layouts and color schemes. Floor tiles and walls are all different between rooms, giving a very confusing feel to the structure. However, each room is always arranged around one central area surrounded by what appears to be windows or doors.</p><p>No door can be found from outside SCP-104 into the interior, nor can any window that appears to lead outside be found inside. Every door inside SCP-104 will open outward if opened from inside; the only known exception is on the north west corner of the basement, which opens inward for unknown reasons.</p><p>SCP-104 is highly flammable; any sustained fire will ignite the entire structure in short time regardless of methods used to extinguish it. The current Foundation containment procedures have been set up due to extensive damage that occurred in 1945 when attempts to burn SCP-104 were made; however, compared to earlier containment efforts this fire has caused little damage due to the extra protection provided by SCP-636 itself now being contained within it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
