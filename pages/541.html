<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-541</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-541 is to be kept in a standard Safe class item locker at Site-77. If a subject with related knowledge is to be brought in for testing, it is to be done under the guise of "a new type of radio transmitter". In situations of extreme danger (i.e. where the subject's personal safety is at risk or SCP-541 has been compromised) Protocol-551-A is to be enacted and the subject to be recovered using D-Class personnel as cover.</p><p>No more than one individual may work on SCP-541 at a time. No more than five people may work on SCP-541 at any given time; all additional personnel are not to enter SCP-541's containment until they have been debriefed on their experience and are no longer contaminated by SCP-541.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-541 is a small black box measuring 22.5 cm x 11.5 cm x 5.5 cm, with one input and two outputs. SCP-541 is sewn together from almost 500,000 individual wires, each of which is about 3 mm long. The material of the box itself appears to be polymer and cloth in composition, but does not appear to have any anomalous properties on its own.</p><p>When active, SCP-541 displays various blueprints for various electronics devices and can transmit signals through the use of these designs. Occasionally, SCP-541 will make a noise that sounds like an EM signal transmitted by SCP-541. When this occurs, it is believed that SCP-541 is contacting an entity or entity group which alters the design of electronic devices based on this signal alone. This process appears to occur independently of SCP-541's own design capabilities, as SCP-541 has only been observed to generate the signal in real time rather than being capable of storing or recalling the signal and transmitting it later.</p><p>SCP-541 was recovered during exploratory research into unusual radio signals in Northeastern Mexico. When initially recovered, it did not appear to possess any anomalous properties (save for the anomalous signals it transmitted). Later analysis has shown that SCP-541 does indeed contain anomalous properties, but these are currently inaccessible as it contains all known information regarding its construction and activation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
