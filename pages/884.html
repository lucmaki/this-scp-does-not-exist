<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-884</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-884 is currently housed in an airtight containment locker at Site-72. The object must be monitored by CCTV 24 hours a day, with the storage locker being checked the same amount. Free access to the object is limited to those with Level 3 or higher clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-884 is a pair of headphones, constructed from a black plastic base with a rubber-coated cord. A wired remote control is affixed to the cord, with an antenna that extends from the back of the device until it connects with the audio transceiver on the other side. The object weighs 0.55kg and measures 1.6cm x 4.4cm x 1.0cm when completely assembled.</p><p>When activated, SCP-884 will allow signals to pass through it between any two devices using audio equipment in proximity. The signal transmitted can vary depending on the number of speakers used, but this has not been observed in practice due to the device being relatively unknown outside of research facilities. While testing has shown that only audible sound can be transmitted between the two devices, and that only the human ear is capable of detecting the signal (through a microphone or similar device), there is no perceived loss in quality between these techniques.</p><p>SCP-884 functions independently of its own ability, meaning that a second unit can be used to simulate double recording on any equipment not directly connected to SCP-884.</p><p>When used for recording purposes, SCP-884 will record at a rate of 48 kbps at any position within one meter from itself, starting from anywhere within 25 meters from where it was initially activated. Testing has shown that any given device will have exactly one recording stored on it at any time; while this is acceptable when recording music or other audio only tracks, it becomes problematic when attempting to record interviews or video footage with additional sound to account for background noises or dialogue. Recording over previous recordings made by SCP-884 using its own single audio source would cause the recording to be corrupted by duplicates and overwrite them as they are played back. Recordings made directly onto storage media are not affected by this effect.</p><p>When activated with two devices that both have audio equipment enabled, SCP-884 will operate exactly as described above except will allow access to four simultaneous channels instead of two through one device; recordings made on both devices will be combined into one recorded track by SCP-884 for playback purposes. Placing such two devices close together causes no apparent harm to either (though prolonged use could lead to concentration difficulties and/or auditory fatigue), though playback suffers from lessened quality due to overlapping sounds and fewer channels available for recording (up to four total). However, if placed more than 50 meters away from each other and playing back at normal volume levels, separate recordings can be played out simultaneously without producing any noticeable distortion in voice or sound effects beyond what would occur naturally. At farther distances, multiple separate recorders must be utilized or normal playback quality suffers even more.</p><p>If activated on or after ██/██/█████ using solely audio equipment alone (no display nor input devices) and played simultaneously at normal volume levels in this manner while connected through an amplifier or loudspeaker system (with no display attached) without transitioning locations first, damage can result to both the power amplifier and loudspeaker systems depending on how loud playback was set before transitioning locations:</p><p>Power Amplifier: Small amounts of electrical shock were recorded from speaker panels whenever playback was turned up more than ~60% louder than normal levels due to static buildup in speakers caused by constant switching between channels during playback without allowing enough time for air movement before switching again; internal wiring appeared scorched around transformer core due to nearby heat buildup caused by current being sent through it at such high levels. Longer periods of continuous playback caused further damage throughout amplifier components over time as excess current flowed through normally non-electrically conductive materials such as metal frame tubes surrounding silicone rubber insulation on speaker wires and magnetic components inside power amplifiers; at normal volumes no damage was recorded unless exposed directly by speakers themselves without cooling ventilation when playing louder than normal levels continuously for extended periods (approximately one hour).</p><p>Loudspeaker Systems: Overheating occurred in speaker units directly connected to amplification circuit boards after approximately seven minutes of continuous playback at higher than normal volumes due to excessive current being sent down speaker wires causing them to short against metal frames behind protective grills covering speakers; individual speakers were melted beyond repair in some cases due to overheating soldering pours invading insulation layers throughout units; heat buildup from power amplifiers left behind after brief duration led to lightening of suspension rods inside cabinets leading later damage when amp output was allowed build up within range again over short period (ten minutes).</p><p>While this may seem severe enough that any remote area should be avoided altogether when exploring potential SCP containment sites for electronic equipment if it has ever been encountered in reality, extensive testing indicates otherwise:</p><p>Testing has shown that there appears to be no definitive 'safe' distance between SCP-884's two intended audio sources although all results indicate approximately 100 meters away should prevent damage long term while maintaining usefulness as medium range broadcasting application and sync point when transferring media files via USB storage drives.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
