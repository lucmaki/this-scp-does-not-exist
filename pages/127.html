<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-127</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-127 instances are currently being kept in an animal containment facility in Area-27 within the ██████ National Forest.</p><p>SCP-127 instances are to be provided with at least eight (8) daily feeds of lab rat chow and two (2) daily doses of metacam per instance, administered via a standard oral syringe. Feedings are to be carried out by D-Class personnel.</p><p>All non-human subjects within area 27 are to be monitored for signs of SCP-127 infection. Subjects who exhibit behavioral changes indicating an increase in strength or aggression are to be treated with metacam. Any subjects showing survival beyond 1 hour after treatment is considered a failed maintenance dose.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-127 is a parasitic entity that infests animals by attaching to the dorsal nerve ganglion of the brain, apparently via an unknown mechanism. Prolonged exposure to SCP-127 causes the host animal to gradually change into a more aggressive and powerful version of itself, known as an SCP-127 instance.</p><p>SCP-127 instances remain dormant inside their hosts during most of the day, but become active at night when they undergo a "regeneration cycle", which usually takes place every few days or weeks. The duration of this cycle coincides with the time between feedings. During this process, SCP-127 will take on a new appearance and continue learning martial arts and fighting techniques from its previous host. This process is also accompanied by neurological improvements in the host's muscle strength, reflexes and senses.</p><p>SCP-127 instances gain all knowledge and skills as well as physical attributes from their previous hosts in addition to their own, increasing their overall strength, stamina and intelligence. New instances will also eventually start taking on different hosts from different areas such as countries, continents or even oceans.</p><p>Thus far, two known species of SCP-127 have been observed:</p><p>SCP-127 is currently kept under observation in an animal containment facility until further notice.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
