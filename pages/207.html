<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-207</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-207 is currently contained within a reinforced cell located in Sector B6-3a of Site-54, which has been equipped with a tracking device. The cell doors are to remain locked at all times, and only personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher are to be given access to the cell.</p><p>All persons exposed to SCP-207's effects must be positioned within sight of an Ethics Committee member at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-207 is a series of five books, collectively titled The Keeper. The books are each composed of small sections stitched together by thread. From these sections, large quantities of text can be extracted using an ordinary needle and thread. SCP-207 appears to have been created by a collective of SCPologists, who were presumably involved in its containment.</p><p>SCP-207's effects manifest when any person who has viewed the books for more than three minutes or so begins reading them. During this period, all sensory input relating to the outside world is blocked. The subject will also perceive their surroundings as a large room with multiple doors leading off into other rooms throughout it. These doors will be opened at random by the entity reading the books. Whenever one of these doors is opened, various characters belonging to various fictional universes are observed interacting with each other. They will do so while stating that they have moved to a new world (hence SCP-207's designation).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
