<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-82</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-82 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. SCP-82 may only be removed from the containment locker for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-82 is a closed, white curtain measuring approximately 150cm x 150cm. SCP-82 shows no signs of wear or damage, despite testing which clearly show that it has been opened and closed dozens of times.</p><p>When it is held open for more than five minutes, SCP-82 will automatically close itself. When held in the closed position for more than ten minutes, SCP-82 will begin to heat up until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius. At this point, all matter within SCP-82 will begin to liquify. This is believed to be caused by SCP-82's anomalous effect of being able to store heat over a considerable period of time. The inferno produced by this event quickly extinguishes itself after only one minute.</p><p>SCP-82 was recovered on ██/██/████ following reports of a series of fires set in [REDACTED]. Subsequent investigation has shown that the fire had been triggered by an unknown individual who had been attempting to produce SCP-82's effect using [REDACTED].</p><p>If an individual is requested to hold open SCP-82 for five minutes, then the item will not spontaneously close.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
