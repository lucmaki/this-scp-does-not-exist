<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-844</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-844 is to be contained in a Secure Containment Locker at Site 12. When not being kept in its containment locker, SCP-844 is to be stored in a locked steel box with a lid that locks from the inside. To prevent unauthorized access to the containment unit, SCP-844’s container is to be fitted with a motion sensor and guarded by at least two armed guards. If SCP-844 becomes active, it may be repositioned and one guard must immediately notify at least three more guards in the vicinity, who are to restrain the object until it comes into an inactive state.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-844 is a steel bag containing what appears to be several hundred pounds of charcoal. When an individual wearing glasses is within 20 cm of the object, it becomes electrified, emitting an electrical current similar to a low-voltage taser. It will begin transmitting this power at the person in question if they are not wearing glasses or if they move closer to SCP-844 than the 20 cm limit. The current produced by SCP-844 is weak and cannot inflict any harm on human tissue, but can cause discomfort and disorientation in those who are exposed to it. If the user wearing glasses attempts to remove their sunglasses, SCP-844 will cease its power output and become inert. This effect can be prevented through the use of corrective lenses.</p><p>SCP-844 was recovered from ██████, New Jersey following reports of odd events occurring in a jewelry store in the ███████ Mall. Initial reports suggested that several individuals had been attacked by a group of armed assailants while shopping in the mall; however, no details were provided. The Foundation investigation was initiated after initial contact with one of the victims resulted in the victim’s being administered amnestics and being released from hospital care with no memory of their time in the mall.</p><p>Objective: To communicate with SCP-844 as it continues its current anomalous behavior and determine how it functions.</p><p>Excluded Subjects: Personnel handling SCP-844 must wear protective eyewear when around the object in order to prevent potential bodily harm should it be activated again.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
