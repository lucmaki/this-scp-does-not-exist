<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-70</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All known instances of SCP-70 are to be studied and documented. As many instances as possible are to be kept on-site within Site-64. All areas affected by SCP-70 are to be covered with photovoltaic panels, and the area in question is designated as an off-limits area. No equipment or personnel should be brought into or out of this area without preapproval from at least two (2) different Level 3 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-70 is a phenomenon that occurs once every three years, affecting areas within the Embassy district in Washington D.C. The first recorded occurrence occurred on December 30th, 1999. During this event, all electronics in the region were either destroyed or rendered unusable. A second recorded occurrence occurred on December 29th, 2001. During this event, all electronics were lost. A third documented SCP-70 event occurred on November 18th, 2004. No electronic devices have been located after this time frame in the Embassy area.</p><p>During an SCP-70 event, all electronics within a 5-meter radius of SCP-70 will cease to function. All electronics within wireless range of SCP-70 will become completely nonfunctional and random numbers will be displayed on any computer connected to a network card containing a hard drive containing data relevant to electrical systems or to factories that produce electronic devices. TV sets and VCRs will display images related to technology used by factories and manufacturing plants at random intervals as well as standard clock displays, functioning only when directly connected to AC power sources. Only radio equipment during this time period has been found to consistently produce audible sounds; whether these sounds are intended for human hearing is unknown.</p><p>The Institute for Future Technology has been investigating the properties of SCP-70 and is currently attempting to find an explanation for its origin and effect.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
