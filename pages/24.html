<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-24</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-24 is to be kept in an airtight container and kept at a temperature of between -78 and -86 degrees Celsius. SCP-24 is not to be taken out of this container, or allowed to come in contact with any outside objects. All objects that exist outside the container are to be considered Keter Level objects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-24 appears to be a tattoo-like mark on the neck of a Caucasian male, approximately 1.9m (6.2 ft) tall. SCP-24 can appear anywhere on the human body and is not shown to be directly connected to a person's life or soul.</p><p>The pattern of SCP-24 appears to be in that of a large plume of smoke, with some blurring details around the middle and base. Areas where it does not cover are somewhat vague and blurry, giving off an impression that the outer points of SCP-24 are missing. The object belongs to a species that has never been found in any biological samples other than those belonging to SCP-24, but is capable of self-replication through some unknown means.</p><p>SCP-24 emits no radiation, heat, or other measurable form of energy beyond what would normally be associated with visible light (this ability is currently being researched). The only known way that SCP-24 reproduces is by transforming any materials into its properties.</p><p>It cannot take any physical form, unless it is something organic. It has been shown to transform living organisms into its form while they are still alive. After death, these organisms' bodies are transformed into SCP-24 from their original matter, and become unidentifiable as anything else except for being made semi-translucent with a continuous 'smoke' pattern in them.</p><p>So far, none of the affected individuals who were transformed into SCP-24 had any skills or abilities that would allow for an escape or observation method apart from SCP-24 itself. This allows for no less than 4 level 3 personnel to monitor it at once and prevent it from escaping containment indefinitely if necessary.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
