<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-802</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-802 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-17. Any personnel within the testing area are to be silenced with a handkerchief over their mouths and noses when not engaged in experimentation. The area around SCP-802 is to be sealed off with a solid door and monitored remotely. All persons entering the testing area are to wear eye protection, as well as gloves to prevent contamination from SCP-802.</p><p>Personnel involved in testing of SCP-802 are not allowed access to any non-essential equipment; all testing equipment is to be returned to the testing chamber at the conclusion of tests.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-802 is a television set. The only features that do not appear to be working are the power light, the volume and channel buttons, the channel selector knob, and an internal speaker. SCP-802 displays no video of its own. SCP-802 has been observed to display a static image of itself at approximately 60% of the screen.</p><p>Predictably, experimentation with SCP-802 has proven very difficult; the device has proven unable to provide human beings with any useful information or entertainment. Direct viewing using most forms of detection equipment (including cameras equipped with infrared sensors) will produce either nothing or what seems to be static noise. It is unknown whether this is a result of the television's anomalous properties, or if it is due to an inherent fault in such devices as infrared detectors. No information on how SCP-802 functions can be gleaned from directly interacting with it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
