<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-714</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-714 is to be housed within a small locker, fitted with the necessary components for the storage of controlled substances (see Addendum 714-01). SCP-714's anomalous properties are not to be used for any recreational or research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-714 is an anomalous item, consisting of a wooden log, adorned with a mural painted by an unknown person. The mural depicts a scene of an unknown place, facing the observer, and portrays an elderly man carrying an object or animal on his shoulders. The man is wearing a coat and a hat (which does not match the true colors of the moth), which is adorned by innumerable butterflies on its crown.</p><p>Upon the subject's forceful entry into SCP-714's containment, six sets of wings (three sets from brown moths, two from red moth species) will spread out over the surface of SCP-714. Once this occurs, the mural will transition into various scenes depicting different events, such as hunting expeditions, battles in which animals are seemingly killed by arrows and humans wielding swords. The changes in the mural will only occur if its subject is still inside SCP-714's chamber.</p><p>If the subject exits SCP-714 at any point after entry closes, three images within the mural will shift to depict different points along with the new location upon receding into view. Each scene depicts animals located at that location, possibly prey for MTF Lambda-12 ("Adventurers Group") agents or other humanoid lifeforms (including other humans). Some scenes depict locations that are impossible to reach by non-anomalous transport methods (such as space). Attempts to explore these locations have proved futile.</p><p>SCP-714's anomalous properties have been established in November 2005, when MTF Lambda-12 agents were dispatched to investigate rumors of human corpses being found in various locations throughout the American continent (see Addendum 714-03).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
