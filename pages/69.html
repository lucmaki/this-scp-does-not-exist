<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-69</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-69 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. It is recommended that no such containment locker be used in the future due to their tendency to spontaneously degrade into SCP-69. Locking the door of said containment locker does nothing in preventing the degradation.</p><p>Current research is focusing on the development of a 'stable' containment method for SCP-69. At this time, it is theorized that long term isolation of SCP-69 may result in the creation of a 'stable' type of SCP-69.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-69 is a non-anomalous piece of wood. It is colorless, solid, and the density of graphite. The wood breaks easily, but regenerates by itself at a constant rate. SCP-69 has no eyes, ears, or nose. Instead it produces various types of mucus using its "nose". SCP-69 will also emit movement if someone comes within 10 m of it.</p><p>SCP-69 was discovered in an estate owned by █████ ██████████ in ████, England. The estate had been abandoned since 1873. It was estimated that the house had sat vacant for at least 100 years prior to discovery. A single family had resided there until their death in 1853 when a degree of fungi had grown on the walls due to lack of moisture.</p><p>Upon initial inspection, no anomalous properties were immediately noticed. The furniture within was described as "decrepit". Holes had been bored into the floorboards throughout the house, presumably to provide light and ventilation underneath. During the first investigations of SCP-69, a decayed human hand was found within one of these holes.</p><p>On 28/06/19██, SCP-69 began emitting what is referred to as SCP noise (SCP noise is produced by SCP objects regardless of the nature of the object). This noise consists of approximately 1% falsettos, 8% tenors, 13% baritones and 30% sopranos. Despite this makeup, no discernible melody can be made out from SCP noise. The frequency that this noise is produced at has been measured at between 9 cents and 35 cents (in accordance with the metric system). This volume includes both long and short bursts separated by periods ranging from 5 to 15 minutes in length. During these periods many people have reported mild nausea and dizziness lasting anywhere from seconds to hours (presumably related to vertigo induced by SCP-69's noise).</p><p>During these periods, people have reported hearing noises seemingly coming from inside or under the floorboards. These could be described as footsteps or creaking furniture which are not audible once SCP-69 stops emitting noise.</p><p>These instances are difficult for researchers to study as instances take place during periods where SCP-69 is silent and only produce noise when needed for observation purposes; however sightings have been documented on multiple occasions.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
