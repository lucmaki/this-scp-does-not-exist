<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-486</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-486 is to be contained within a standard containment chamber at Site-17's Teleportation Wing. When not in use, SCP-486 should have its exterior panels sealed and its interior exposed to the vacuum of space so that ionized gases will flow through it.</p><p>SCP-486's interior should be maintained to prevent chemical corrosion. Additionally, it should be kept blanketed with an oxygen sampler to detect and locate organisms inhabiting the interior.</p><p>Once every two weeks, SCP-486's interior should be checked to ensure that no organisms have breached the chamber; if so, they are to be incinerated immediately. Any loss of atmosphere in SCP-486 will result in that section of SCP-486 being sealed off and all atmosphere being pumped back into the interior until it has been replenished.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-486 is a starship of unknown origin. SCP-486 was found orbiting a nearby star system sometime in the early 21st century. The lack of dust and other physical debris around SCP-486 suggests that it had been dormant for several decades before its discovery.</p><p>A large portion of the interior of SCP-486 consists of a small habitat filled with elastic polymers that can stretch to accommodate its inhabitants. This habitat type is found on several different types of starships throughout the Foundation's database. It is currently unknown how SCP-486's inhabitants are able to live in such environments, although they have been observed doing so by repeatedly stretching an arm or leg outside their habitat, then rapidly pulling it back in, as if they were being pulled apart.</p><p>Test 486-1: Subject 7B was placed inside SCP-486's interior and allowed to interact with it for two hours. Inside the interior, 7B reported feeling no discomfort from motion within a vacuum environment. After interacting with SCP-486 for two hours, 7B stated that "the space [was] kind of empty", but did not appear to experience any discomfort from the ship's environment.</p><p>Over the next several days, 7B developed acute muscle pain in her shoulders and arms, eventually causing her to take painkillers and use a wheelchair to move about. This was eventually downgraded to not requiring medication; however, 7B noted that her shoulder muscles were still sore whenever she attempted physical activity after approximately 30 days inside SCP-486.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
