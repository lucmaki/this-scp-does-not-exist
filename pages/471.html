<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-471</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All persons of Caucasian descent within a hundred-kilometer radius of SCP-471 are to be officially registered as residents of a rural village in northern Thailand. Accordingly, those persons are to undergo the standard amnestic treatment method used in Foundation-sponsored programs for the resettlement of former members of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CKP) and Khmer Rouge (Khmer Rouge).</p><p>In addition to this vaccination program, medical examinations for skin cancer or melanoma are to be conducted on all persons in the designated zone. All cases found are to be submitted to a Foundation-appointed cancer specialist for analysis and treatment.</p><p>Procedures are to be completed by no later than 2073. For purposes of personnel training, the Foundation has established several training grounds in the region, wherein personnel may practice the application of biological weapons in a controlled environment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-471 is a location in northern Thailand, approximately 150 kilometers north of the city of Surat Thani. The exact coordinates are ██████ ██████ 17°███</p><p>According to local legends, the entrance to SCP-471 is always covered by thick, impenetrable jungle vegetation and an unmarked gate, which also serve as a gap in the otherwise unbroken jungle canopy. SCP-471 is currently 1.5 kilometers in width and 9 kilometers in length, although growth rates preclude measurement of the exact width or length beyond 1573.</p><p>The interior of SCP-471 consists entirely of a single paved road, lined with palm trees whose trunks are hollowed out. In addition, the ground throughout the entire region is largely made up of soft mud or sand (see Addendum 471-01).</p><p>The majority of individuals living in the area have been observed to have developed senile streaks and minor forms of skin cancer due to exposure to SCP-471's unique qualities. In particular, exposure to any part of the region for more than 1 day results in uncontrollable changes in the skin pigmentation of inhabitants, who will subsequently develop senile streaks and skin cancer at an accelerated rate.</p><p>Several former members of the CKP and Khmer Rouge have also been reported to experience similar effects after relocation to SCP-471.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
