<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-771</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Two men dressed in Site-██ uniforms and armed with sidearms are to be stationed in a parking lot at the edge of a fifteen kilometer perimeter surrounding SCP-771. The perimeter is to be patrolled by guards wearing standard Site-██ uniforms. No personnel are to enter the area except for members of Dirmid.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-771 is a circular enclosure approximately thirty meters in diameter. The surface of the object is covered in clear plastic, with openings for ventilation on the west and south sides. The floor of the enclosure is composed of large, grey steel sawdust which has been left exposed to the elements.</p><p>The perimeter surrounding SCP-771 is covered in large circular depressions, varying in size from five centimeters to five meters across. These depressions are filled with a thick, dark brown sludge. All soils within fifty meters of SCP-771 show a similar composition, so that it can be assumed they represent the remains of several thousand (possibly even several hundred thousand) swine.</p><p>SCP-771 was discovered by Foundation personnel during an investigation into reports of missing livestock. Numerous witnesses claimed seeing pigs leave their pens at night and enter G███████ Park, but none were ever found. A Dirmid agent shot one such witness, and although there was no trace of the animal afterward, it was determined that its death was likely caused by SCP-771's anomalous properties rather than an attack from another creature. After this incident, a team was dispatched to investigate the anomaly; upon reaching SCP-771, it was encased in Foundation property and a cover story disseminated via Site-██.</p><p>Since then, SCP-771 has continued to exist but has caused no further incidents or damage unless directly affected by other anomalous objects or phenomena.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
