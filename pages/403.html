<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-403</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-403 is contained in a 10 m x 20 m x 0.5 m containment cell. The walls are lined with metal sheeting, but the object itself is subject to the usual type 2 restraints. A camera is mounted above the object, connected via an upload wire.</p><p>The chamber is ventilated to remove humidity from the immediate area. Any tears or other damage to the metal flooring should be repaired immediately.</p><p>SCP-403's containment chamber is located on site 57 of Site-86 and is to be supplied with electricity at all times. This requires Foundation personnel to enter the containment chamber at least 30 minutes before its usage.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-403 is an object composed of iron and steel. It weighs 1.1 Kg and is 2.5m in length, 0.8m in height, and 1m in width. When placed upon the floor, it forms a circle of approximately 5 cm thickness.</p><p>When this circle is "squeezed" by a human hand, the wall will be damaged. The exact cause of damage is unknown, but it appears to closely imitate the shape of the hand that pressed it.</p><p>SCP-403's destructive capabilities differ depending upon the type of creature touching it. The following table lists its levels of destructive power.</p><p>No variation in strength or damage has been observed across different types of creatures touching SCP-403 when in containment.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
