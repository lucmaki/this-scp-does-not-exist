<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-350</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A 100 m high fence, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, has been constructed around SCP-350. No animals may enter or leave the perimeter without Foundation approval. Each member of the public entering SCP-350 must be monitored by security personnel at all times. Any cattle deaths within SCP-350 are to be investigated as potential SCP-350 kills and classified as such.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-350 is a grassland biome in █████, ██████. It is completely devoid of any wildlife or vegetation, aside from vanilla plants and grasses. The area also appears to be entirely devoid of humans. However, the soil within SCP-350 is remarkably fertile and capable of supporting large populations of normal livestock.</p><p>Entering SCP-350 causes the affected subject to enter a coma lasting between 12 and 18 hours. Upon awakening, subjects report having awoken in an unknown location equidistant from their origin point and the current location (See Addendum 350-A). Subjects have reported that any vegetation present has been altered beyond recognition, but are otherwise unharmed and note no structural damage or trauma.</p><p>If a subject remains within SCP-350 for more than 24 hours, they will expire due to starvation or dehydration. No evidence has ever been found indicating how food or water enters SCP-350. Testing with nonhuman subjects is currently prohibited by Ethics Committee approval pending further study; testing with human test subjects is currently in progress (See Addendum 350-B)</p><p>SCP-350 was discovered after the Foundation captured and interrogated one of the six specimens involved in a livestock raiding attempt (See Addendum 350-C.)</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
