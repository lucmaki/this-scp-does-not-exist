<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-587</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The lake surrounding SCP-587 is to be monitored at all times. Any civilian or Foundation personnel attempting to enter SCP-587 should be immediately engaged by security. SCP-587 is currently uncontained and may only be approached in the largest life jackets available, operated by an autonomous underwater vehicle capable of remaining submerged indefinitely. No human interaction is to be attempted within 2 kilometers of SCP-587, except as per </p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-587 is a large lake situated in the Oita prefecture of Japan, approximately 1000 kilometers southeast of Tokyo. Access to SCP-587 is currently impossible due to the object itself and its effects. The water in SCP-587 possesses a low viscosity due to the lack of an upper layer. Extended exploration of SCP-587 while the water remains at this state has resulted in significant damage to the subject's diving suit, such as punctures caused by submerged objects.</p><p>Human testing indicates that SCP-587 is capable of attracting vagrants and other unapproved personnel who enter the water to search for treasure and/or attract attention to themselves. All persons who enter SCP-587 are rapidly and continuously drained of blood, with no effect on blood loss continuing during emergence from SCP-587. Approximately 98% of the victims fail to exit SCP-587 alive, with 97% failing to reemerge from within its waters after death. In all cases, the victim will be found floating upside down, their torso facing upwards.</p><p>Testing with D-Class personnel has determined that any wound sustained within 2 kilometers of SCP-587 will continue bleeding even after exit from SCP-587 if there is a flow of fresh blood into SCP-587. Tissue near wounds (e.g., fingers or toes) will often be found torn off by the current inside SCP-587 when exiting it; victims' skeletons show signs of severe trauma usually inflicted while they were inside SCP-587.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
