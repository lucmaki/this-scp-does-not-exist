<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-669</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All copies of SCP-669 are to be kept in secure storage at Site 67 until further notice. Staff members on duty at Site 67 are permitted to view SCP-669 once every 3 months for recreation purposes, with no more than a single viewing per week. In cases of emergency, approval from the current Head Researcher must be obtained before viewing. Staff members are prohibited from discussing the contents of SCP-669 outside the testing chambers under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-669 is a collection of 10 Soviet (now Russian) feature films. The titles and short descriptions for each film are listed below.</p><p>SCP-669 was discovered when several staff members at Site 67 became distressed after viewing the films in their entirety, often having severe nightmares afterwards. During the initial handling of SCP-669, Dr. ████ described the first film on view as "a beautiful work of art". After further exposure to SCP-673, Dr. ████ became reclusive and refused to discuss SCP-669 or view it again. Due to this, testing was approved by the current head researcher.</p><p>The films are listed below with brief descriptions:</p><p>Foundation personnel investigating possible parallels between other anomalous coma cases and SCP-669 have determined that a great majority of those who view SCP-669 experience similar actions during their dream state.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
