<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-615</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-615 is to be contained in a standard containment locker, located on site 4. Standard level 3 personnel are to guard this area at all times. Only Level 4 personnel have authorization to access this area.</p><p>Personnel with clearance to open the case are to be briefed on potential hazards of opening said case.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-615 is a cargo ship of unremarkable appearance. The ship itself has no particular anomalous properties (such as being built of lead or having living creatures living inside). SCP-615 does, however, carry a single containment locker, containing the 3 containers presented in this document.</p><p>When the key to one of these containers is removed and returned to its original location, it will detonate, destroying all items within the container, as well as any personnel carrying out their duties nearby at the time. The container will then be rendered inert once again.</p><p>SCP-615 was discovered on March 29th, 1966 in ██████ under the designation [DATA EXPUNGED]. This area was declared a crime scene following the destruction of SCP-615 by destroying its contents. No leads regarding source of SCP-615 have been found since.</p><p>All instances of SCP-690 are identical to each other. It is unknown if this is intentional or not. Objects that have been contained by SCP-690 retain the memories of their previous owners - so far, only test subjects from Foundation research have been known to retain memory of their last time using SCP-690.</p><p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
