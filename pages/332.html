<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-332</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Minor</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-332 is contained at Site 49 in a 5m x 10m x 10m enclosure consisting of reinforced concrete, mahogany, and steel. SCP-332's containment chamber is to be kept at 20 degrees Celsius with a humidity level of no less than 80%. During experimentation, a 1mm layer of lead is to be applied to the walls of SCP-332's containment chamber. The humidity level has been lowered from 80% to 70% to prevent SCP-332 from creating additional deposits of water. Maintenance must be done regularly on this layer to prevent it from wearing off and exposing SCP-332's inner structure to the elements.</p><p>SCP-332 is placed in its containment chamber every month for 10 hours where it will be bathed and fed. During experiments with live subjects, no more than one subject is allowed in the same location as SCP-332 at once to prevent potential effects on the surrounding area.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-332's design and physical composition have been variously described as a geometric pattern, an abstracted representation of the tessellated interior of an atom, or a fractal rendering of the atomic lattice. SCP-332 is a non-anomalous piece of volcanic basalt created at ██ BC.</p><p>SCP-332 contains a complex structure not immediately visible to the naked eye. Upon close inspection with a magnifying glass or through x-ray vision, the structure is revealed to consist of an infinite series of interlocking crystals resembling sharp needles. The majority of SCP-332 is composed of metallic prisms, but 104 cubic meters of its interior are composed entirely of water. A drop of water has been shown to be able to penetrate through SCP-332's shell and into its inner contents without breaking apart, though it is unknown how this effect can be achieved without physical damage to SCP-332.</p><p>The interior of SCP-332 flooded with water has been shown to have several effects on external objects. First, any solid object placed inside SCP-332 (including human subjects) will undergo a complete liquidification process over the course of 1 minute and 30 seconds. This event is exclusively observed in instances where the subject is submerged below 1 meter in volume. The remnants of these subjects will then rise again, liquefying as they do so until they reach the surface. Subjects that are submerged below 50% volume are not observed to undergo this liquid phase of their process; however, they appear fully liquid regardless.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
