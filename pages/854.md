<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-854</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to establish a cover story in the community of ██████ and any other similar communities found to have SCP-854. A public nuisance investigation team is to monitor the waters at the scene of any SCP-854 recoveries and take appropriate action.</p><p>SCP-854-1 are to be contained via biohazardous disposal. SCP-854-2 are to be contained via biohazardous disposal. SCP-854-3 are to be contained using an advanced submersible craft capable of ship-to-ship transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-854 is a species of toad endemic to the North American Atlantic Coastal Plain, commonly known as the Chorus Frog. SCP-854, or "Chorus Frogs" in the common parlance, are extremely prolific amphibians, having been observed living on and above the water's surface for extended periods of time.</p><p>These amphibians are capable of vocal mimicry, with specimens displaying vocal capabilities ranging from sound effects such as a door squeak, to simple voicings of human speech. SCP-854 has also shown to be capable of mimicking the sounds made by smaller organisms such as fish, osprey, bumblebees and other land animals; however, their auditory centers are not believed to be capable of picking up faint sounds such as those produced by these creatures. It is theorized that SCP-854's ability to mimic noises is developed through regular interaction with amphibians and similar animals that live on or near water.</p><p>SCP-854 are generally found in large groups during low tide, primarily inhabiting the shallow waters surrounding aquatic tees and ponds. They will approach any large structure (water reservoir, house boat or vessel) and make loud chirps that resemble a gurgling brook. When within one (1) meter from a container of water in which they can climb onto their back legs and lower themselves into, most will cling to it with their claws until nightfall. The next morning they will crawl out into the water where they feed on largely aquatic invertebrates such as worms, snails and small fish. These creatures have shown an affinity for regenerating flesh wounds via unknown means; it is suspected that this is carried out by the prey items being lifted out of the mud by friction between the ground and several appendages located at the end of their limbs.</p><p>SCP-854 Mimes appear docile when first sighted, but have been observed to have developed rare violent tendencies when provoked. However, due to their large size relative to their environment they typically only resort to violence after sources of food have dwindled or when approached by humans attempting to capture them for research purposes.</p><p>Recovery: A containment breach occurred at Site ██ after several cross-contamination incidents occurred within various containment facilities involving SCP-854 organisms being transferred from area A (lab) containment facility onto B (emergency holding area) containment facility. Undercover agents present noted signs indicating this was not an accidental occurrence but rather two instances of SCP-854 usage outside B site's containment procedures; this evidence included discarded food wrappers at the scene and a report from Area A security personnel stating that specimens were being recovered from a nearby pond following a breach of protocol 72B25T27 ("Hazardous Materials Storage"). All D-Class personnel present were administered Class C amnestics after Foundation personnel recovered all SCP-854 specimens present at B site's Containment Area 6 ("Air Bubble") facility.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
