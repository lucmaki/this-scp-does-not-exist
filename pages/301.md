<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-301</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-301 is contained in a secure standard humanoid containment cell. During Containment Breach Exercises, SCP-301 is to be accompanied by at least two (2) security personnel, who are to take orders from Site Command.</p><p>Each month, SCP-301 is to receive a weekly group of morning exercises (see File 301-Open for details). Any individual who wishes to speak with SCP-301 must not be a member of the Foundation itself, but must instead be an outside party that has been thoroughly screened by the Ethics Committee and cleared to visit the area.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-301 is an adult male humanoid entity measuring 1.9 meters tall and weighing 73kg. SCP-301 appears to have been a regular human being, with no anomalous properties, prior to its containment. SCP-301 is extremely agitated and agitated constantly despite the use of local sedative agents.</p><p>SCP-301 has a strong fondness for the Beatles; this is most notably observed in its frequent use of their songs while communicating with other entities.</p><p>When attempting to communicate with SCP-301, it will respond to questions with very specific and complex metaphors that frequently reference the works of the band itself. When asked about its origins and history, SCP-301 will often become hostile or withdrawn and refuse communication altogether. SCP-301's responses cannot be fully understood by humans, but can be selectively translated by individuals with knowledge of literature, pop culture and art.</p><p>Observations: SCP-301 speaks English fluently, but does not appear to be able to understand any other language aside from English. It is believed that SCP-301's level of cognitive ability is similar to an average college graduate.</p><p>When speaking to Foundation employees it has been noted that SCP-301 tends to speak in a higher tone than most humanoids would, using words such as "super" and "mega". Many employees in close proximity describe the sound of SCP-301's voice as having a somewhat robotic quality.</p><p>SCP-301 was captured during a local police raid at ████ ██ ██████ after a string of ATM robberies occurred in ██████████ and ████████ city. After capture, several Foundation operatives were covertly present during interrogation whereupon it was discovered that SCP-301 was responsible for the robberies. Following questioning, SCP-301 was brought into Foundation custody on charges of bank robbery and breach of containment following an incident in which it took control of several patrolling Foundation guards before passing out from exhaustion.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
