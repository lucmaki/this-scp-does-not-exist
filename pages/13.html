<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-13</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> An electronic fence has been constructed around the location of SCP-13. Periodic inspections are to be conducted of the fence to ensure that no openings in the fence exist. All personnel entering and exiting SCP-13 must enter and exit through the facility's front door.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-13 is the subject of an urban legend affecting ██ families in Arizona, USA. The stories differ, but the commonality is that the subject is a house that can only be entered during one's dreams. Attempts to sleep in or wake the subject by any other means fail to work. There are no reports of anyone and anything being able to enter or leave SCP-13, and attempts to move through it or shape its objects have failed regardless of success.</p><p>Each night, one section of the wall between SCP-13 and the outside becomes transparent, meaning that anyone inside may see through to the outside world.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
