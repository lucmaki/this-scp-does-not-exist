<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-525</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation resources are to be used at all times to maintain the illusion that SCP-524 does not exist. Any evidence of the existence of SCP-524 is to be expunged and replaced with an entirely fictitious story. Foundation assets within media and entertainment industry are to be regularly engaged in a cover up, including:</p><p>1) Denial of any knowledge of SCP-524's existence by any employees involved with handling or concealing SCP-524 related material.</p><p>2) Constant alteration of relevant data concerning SCP-524 through editing and manipulation.</p><p>3) Covert disinformation campaigns aimed at discrediting the accusers who attempt to come forward.</p><p>4) Counterintelligence operations, to create a climate of fear among all persons who would speak out against SCP-524. Any suspects who attempt to come forward, or who are otherwise found attempting to reveal the truth about SCP-524, are to be detained, interrogated, discredited and then released under conditions of amnesia.</p><p>Access to these materials is restricted to persons specifically designated as part of Operation MENDACITY. All persons aware of the existence of SCP-524 are to receive Class-A amnestics before beginning their assignment. This includes all current personnel from Mobile Task Force Alpha 7 ("The Positives") assigned within the Entertainment Tainment wing at Site-19.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-524 is the collective designation for a series of performance art works, videos and media products made by Jack Strzempka, purported to feature an entity known as "the Shadowman" or "the Gray Man". The Shadowman has been variously described as an anomalous human male with a distorted and inhuman face, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and fedora hat. This individual is depicted as possessing exceptional ability to manipulate concrete and steel into whatever form he wishes, able to fashion objects from thin air or destroy them instantly. Other reports have described the Shadowman in terms including "ghoulish", "violent", and "sadistic".</p><p>SCP-524 currently consists of two separate entities. The first is the actual production team responsible for these media products (henceforth referred to as SCP-524-1), while the other is believed to be a group of individuals who willingly serve as subjects within these performances (henceforth referred to as SCP-524-2). These individuals are never physically present within SCP-524 productions, and are rarely given any meaningful role. However, they appear to serve in a passive capacity as walking advertisements for SCP-524.</p><p>The official name of SCP-524 is: "The Cult of Personality".</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
