<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-552</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-552 is to be kept within a standard containment locker at Site-28. No study of the object is permitted, including recorded images. Personnel are to contact the senior researcher in charge of the SCP-552 project for the purpose of requesting any new subjects of study.</p><p>SCP-552 should be cleaned once every year with a non-metallic detergent. All visible damage caused to the object by this cleaning should be repaired as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-552 is a wooden staff composed of a series of carved plants. The object measures 5 inches in length with a thickness of 7/8ths inch and an overall weight of 21.2 g. SCP-552 was found among the effects of a deceased individual, along with several articles of evidence identifying him as the owner of the object.</p><p>SCP-552 produces an effect similar to that of ayurveda (an ancient Indian medicine system) when held by any person with at least 1 prior day of exposure to the object.</p><p>When SCP-552 is held by a person, they begin experiencing feelings contrary to those felt when exposed to other objects, up to and including positive feelings towards the object itself and negative feelings towards anyone who attempts to remove SCP-552 from them. These emotions are reported to be both intense and long lasting, similar in feeling to that experienced when first exposed to SCP-552.</p><p>When SCP-552 has been held by someone for at least three days, their eyes lose color and hue rapidly until they have begun yellowing. After this process has begun, it will continue until no change can be detected in the subject's eye color after an additional seven days. Staining caused by iris dilation will not be permanent; however, tissue damage will continue without warning.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
