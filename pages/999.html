<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-999</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-999 is to be contained in a ten (10) meter wide, five (5) meter deep culvert, made from reinforced concrete, located on the ████ ████████ Road in ████████, United States of America at Site-26. SCP-999 must be contained with a concrete wall on all sides, extending three (3) meters into the earth.</p><p>SCP-999 must not be allowed to flow into any public sewer drains. SCP-999 may not be transported outside of containment unless it is within a secure and monitored container. All samples of SCP-999 are to be maintained at -80 degrees Celsius, and must remain frozen at all times. Any individuals that come in contact with SCP-999 must wear full Level A Hazmat suits and respiratory protection when transporting it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-999 is a viscous, translucent, black fluid that flows freely through the ████████ sewage system in ████████, United States of America. The fluid is identical in composition and appearance to the ink used for all modern printed matter. While SCP-999 does not have any anomalous properties itself, if it is transported from where it originates to another location within the United States of America, it will be transported along with any material printed on it (see Addendum 999.4).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
