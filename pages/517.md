<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-517</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-517 is kept in a standard Safe-class storage locker at Site-██. The storage locker has been fitted with a motion sensor and proximity alarm, and its interior is to be checked every six (6) hours; any changes from the approved configuration are to be reported to site security.</p><p>Recovery Log 517-A: On 9/13/19██, SCP-517 was sent to Site-██ for testing purposes. While under testing, SCP-517 began exploring its new environment. Security personnel attempted to take over SCP-517's containment chamber using a mobile task force, but this proved unsuccessful. After thirty (30) minutes of investigation, SCP-517 ceased movement and spontaneously reconfigured itself into an eggplant.</p><p>After sixty (60) minutes of monitoring, SCP-517 reconfigured itself again into the previously observed pattern of two humps, one on the right and one on the left. SCP-517 was returned to its original configuration and placed into a standard safe containment unit.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-517 is a humanoid entity, 78 cm tall and weighing 75 kg. SCP-517's head is that of an eggplant, with the external appearance of the fruit and the interior properties of a vegetable. The skin of SCP-517 is resistant to temperature extremes, though its internal organs are subject to temperatures as high as 3200°C (5180°F).</p><p>SCP-517 displays almost no reaction to pain; as such it can be dissected without disturbing its actions or position. When removed from its native environment, SCP-517 will recreate itself within twenty-four (24) hours. It shares many properties with plant life, but with some key differences:</p><p>SCP-517's physiology is largely incompatible with human anatomy and has been observed to cause various organs to rupture under stress. However, SCP-517 is capable of surviving indefinitely in this state and has remained alive while suspended in open space.</p><p>SCP-517 possesses an extremely aggressive behaviour and will actively attack personnel. Due to its lack of normal human reflexes, SCP-517's attacks are very accurate and difficult to evade. When directly attacked, SCP-517 will attempt to bend any sharp object it can into a leaf shape and use it as a flail weapon. SCP-517 also has shown a strategic grasp for tactics and seems to place a high priority on survival, often taking measures which would be fatal to mere humans.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
