<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-498</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-498 is to be kept in a locked desk drawer at the Information Security department of Site-77.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-498 is a paperback book entitled "That's What She Said: A Gay Stories of True Love and Romance", written by Dr. Steven J. Segal (aka: Jason Paul Slade), printed in 2010. It is 352 pages long.</p><p>SCP-498 takes the form of a literary anthology, containing numerous short stories about homosexual relationships between men, women, and transgenders. Each story is formatted as an ePub file and attached to this object as a read file. The original text of the stories can be retrieved from Dr. Segal's website at http://www.jasonpaulslade.com/.</p><p>SCP-498 does not have any anomalous properties outside of its effect on the subject reading it; however, reading SCP-498 causes significant cognitive dissonance among the reader, if they are commonly heterosexual or bisexual.</p><p>If the reader has been exposed to sexuality or pornography that involves persons of the same sex before reading SCP-498, they will become significantly more uncomfortable with their sexual orientation following exposure to SCP-498. This discomfort may manifest itself in an increased interest in homosexuality or other nonheterosexual sexualities and an aversion to sex with persons that they were previously attracted to; however, these effects are not specific to homosexuals or bisexuals and affect heterosexuals as well. Cases have been reported where heterosexual males have become obsessed with homosexual culture after reading SCP-498, leading to several unsuccessful attempts at homosexual intercourse.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
