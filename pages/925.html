<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-925</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Standard</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-925 are held in a standard Safe-class containment locker. At least one instance of SCP-925 must be kept out of the view of the subject during tests.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-925 is a series of small, coin-sized wrapped objects made from silver. Each instance features an image of a Nintendo character on the outside, with the text “Happy Birthday”. Instances of SCP-925 were recovered from an abandoned fifth-floor apartment in ███████ ██████████, where they had been found by police who had responded to a domestic disturbance.</p><p>When taken apart before exposing the coin inside, instances of SCP-925 can each be opened up to reveal a photograph. The photographs correspond to the time the photograph was taken. At this time it is unknown how or why these correspondences exist. The photos are astonishingly well kept, with no visible damage and a number of them being unaltered by time. One instance of SCP-925 has been observed to date back several decades in age.</p><p>The subject will express annoyance, surprise or confusion when opened, while all others present will react positively. At least one instance must be removed from the subject at any given time during tests and placed in a locked box with an appropriate object. The reaction of subjects can be modified by changing the way that SCP-925 is exposed, such as opening it manually instead of opening it via the photograph and placing it in the box first. This effect is stronger for any subjects who have met or seen the individual depicted in the photograph at some point in their life; this does not affect subjects who have interacted with the individual only once. Subjects will also react more positively if they are shown pictures from their own childhood than pictures from other subjects' childhoods.</p><p>It appears that having one's birthday held commemorated in this manner has no deleterious effect on chronological age; however, subject can still claim that they are older than they are through advanced math or other methods as long as they were born after the date provided by SCP-925.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
