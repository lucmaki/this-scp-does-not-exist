<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-675</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-675 is to be kept in the Site-19 cafeteria. Any staff wishing to interact with SCP-675 is to be advised to wear lead aprons and gloves. All personnel interacting with SCP-675 must have a current flu shot.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-675 is a desk lamp, bearing a stylized latin script reading “LUX”. SCP-675 is capable of sitting on its own and will attempt to do so for any free surface within the immediate vicinity. SCP-675 does not seem to require power in order to function, though it will produce light from its familiar yellow coloration regardless of whether or not it receives adequate energy.</p><p>When a human being stands within roughly 2 meters of SCP-675, SCP-675 will activate and slowly begin animating its lampshade while humming the first four notes of the tune 'Ode to Joy' by Beethoven. The individual will remain animate for as long as they are near SCP-675.</p><p>Individuals affected by SCP-675 are incapable of physically moving more than 50 cm away from the nearest wall or other solid surface; at no point has the movement been able to reach greater than 0 cm. Although this effect is effective on an individual located at a distance far enough away to not be in visual contact with a solid surface provided that one can see their hands, individuals generally have little trouble distributing weight between their legs and feet instead of placing additional stress on muscles through which blood must flow. In most cases (83% of all attempts) individuals affected by SCP-675 can also remain standing when lacking any real physical support for their torso or limbs (approximating their normal gait in such circumstances). However, although unaffected by gravity, these individuals are never able to become airborne in any manner. In almost all cases, affected individuals have no difficulty maintaining bodily control despite lack of muscle tone or sensory feedback.</p><p>The most common method for exiting this animation is for affected individuals to sit down, taking care not to lean on anything with more mass than themself in order to keep their legs under them and keeping one arm raised in front of them as a physical barrier to prevent touching the floor. This prevents prasing while remaining upright; however, this also prevents loss of balance due to decreased force being put upon the skull and spinal column, which many subjects express chagrin over while occupying this animation state.</p><p>Although some subjects report feeling intense boredom while imbedded in this state, many subjects simply appear fascinated by the process and tend to spend most of their time observing it rather than interacting with it directly. It has been observed that subject's eyes will often become fixated on biological structures such as eyes or ears when not fully occupied by patterns projected upon them (such as shadows projected from objects nearby).</p><p>Subjects are able to communicate normally once freed from this animation mode and consequently rarely report issues with vocalization during this period of time.</p><p>For the purposes of testing, D-Class personnel have been given clothing and instructed to enter containment area wearing fully enclosed suits equipped with recording devices; ██ D-Class personnel have been successfully recovered with successful computer playback functioning on ██ occasions where tests were conducted under supervision only.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
