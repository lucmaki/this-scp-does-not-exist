<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-128</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-128 is to be kept in a standard pet containment unit. SCP-128 is allowed access to a standard diet of carp and fish, but is not permitted to consume anything animate. Plants are not permitted in the containment unit or any area containing SCP-128.</p><p>Any flora encountered outside of the containment unit (and thus outside of Foundation possession) is to be destroyed. Any flora found growing on SCP-128 is to be eradicated by any means necessary; [DATA UNAVAILABLE] are to be considered SCP-128's food source.</p><p>In the event that SCP-128 becomes actively hostile, all personnel are instructed to avoid direct physical contact with the object and call in a backup team. Due to the sensitivity of these procedures, MTF units equipped with sound-masking devices have been assigned to this task. If possible, an attempt should be made to fire small caliber ammunition at the plant until it dies. This is only applicable if SCP-128 has been given no other means of physical damage.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-128 is a Japanese Arbroath, an aquatic carnivorous plant native to Japan. The plant grows to a height of 0.5 meters and has a diameter of 1 meter. The main body is white in coloration, with brown/black/red spots arranged in a circular pattern surrounding the base of the plant.</p><p>SCP-128 produces a number of green, leafy tendrils at different points around its body. These tendrils can reach up to 4 meters in length and are capable of exerting moderate force on objects. The tendrils are capable of grasping victims and attempting to strangle or crush them; however, SCP-128 is incapable of movement while it has a victim in its grasp.</p><p>SCP-128 has no confirmed effect on any species other than humans; plants seem completely unaffected by SCP-128's presence.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
