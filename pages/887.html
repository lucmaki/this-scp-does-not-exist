<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-887</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No special containment procedures exist for SCP-887. Civilians are to be discouraged from entering SCP-887.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-887 is a workshop located in █████████, Italy. Constructed approximately 500 m in diameter and 150 cm tall, it includes four levels, one containing a workbench, the remainder fitted with conversion circuitry and other equipment.</p><p>Given that the walls of SCP-887 are transparent and appear to be made of glass, extreme caution is advised when entering the building; if not careful, one's body will pass through the walls. One may see through the transparent wall of SCP-887 if one stands within 2m of it, or above 1m.</p><p>SCP-887 does not contain any mechanical devices or any kinds of anomalous objects; rather, it contains only several similar pieces of equipment used for converting matter into energy or vice versa. These pieces of equipment include:</p><p>These devices do not function normally; seemingly lacking in internal power source, they passively feed off the energy generated by their surroundings (e.g., sunlight). All devices appear to operate on a basis of footexelaboration - i.e., they require a combination of motion and manual operation to act properly.</p><p>When combined together, these devices create an anomalous effect. When sunlight falls upon them, every converted piece of matter in their vicinity reaches an extremely high temperature; recorded temperatures have reached up to ████°C before spontaneously cooling down again. If further explanation is necessary than this simple "catalyst", any person standing near the devices will be directly caught up in the effect as well; all exposed persons will be unable to remove their eyes from the devices' action as long as they are present within view. The affected persons display no signs of suffering discomfort while subject to this effect; however, they do become progressively more impatient towards observing activity within SCP-887 over time.</p><p>Upon entering SCP-887 without being exposed to the devices beforehand, one finds oneself at its center; alongside one's own reflection appears that of an adult male dressed up in Santa Claus' attire (presumably SCP-887's owner). This appearance lasts for approximately 10 seconds before fading away into thin air. SCP-888 exhibits no further anomalous effects while present within SCP-887.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
