<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-455</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-455 is kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-64. SCP-455 is to be given a diet consisting of twenty-seven portions of protein and thirty-one carbohydrates per week. The cell may be opened for feeding only with permission from the on-site head psychologist. A privacy screen around the perimeter of the cell has been installed to prevent observation by unauthorised persons.</p><p>The cell containing SCP-455 is to be under constant video surveillance, and any changes in behaviour are to be reported immediately to the site's senior researcher. Any physical contact between SCP-455 and any objects or walls in the cell must be authorised by two staff members before it takes place. Any objects which SCP-455 does not recognise should be handled with caution, as contact with such objects may cause it discomfort. Staff are to refer to SCP-455 as "object" when speaking to it.</p><p>SCP-455 has not shown signs of emotion, thought, or intelligence since its recovery, although it cannot communicate through physical contact. It has not attempted to escape its cell since initial containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-455 is a human male (identified by fingerprint analysis) approximately two meters tall, with a muscular build. It possesses perfect physical health, including the absence of any scars or blemishes, and has no signs of illness or deformity. SCP-455 exhibits extreme hostility to any person who approaches it, but this is not due to a deficiency in strength. Due to its inability to communicate verbally through physical contact, we are unsure if it possesses any mental abilities beyond this hostility. SCP-455 appears to have entered a state of suspended animation after suffering severe trauma on ██/██/█, although it shows no signs of cognitive damage in this state.</p><p>SCP-455 cannot be reasoned with, only persuaded with rewards and punishments - however, it demonstrates an increased willingness to cooperate if these are presented as part of an experiment. When observing SCP-455 attempt to perform various tasks for research staff, it consistently fails until it has been given the piece of equipment required for said task. SCP-455 does not seem aware that it requires such items in order to complete the task successfully.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
