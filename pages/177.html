<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-177</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation agents should monitor public records for any legal restrictions on access to SCP-177. At the end of each month, it is to be fitted with a GPS tracker and recorded location data checked against SCP-067.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-177 is the site of a pair of abandoned uranium mines located in the northern part of the ████████ Mountains. The terrain is unusually steep, and numerous ropes and ladders have been installed to facilitate access.</p><p>The mines themselves are barren, except for the occasional boulder or low-hanging rock ledge which are covered in graffiti and strange symbols. A large underground tunnel entrance has been constructed at the bottom of one mine. The entrance has been sealed off with concrete and rockcrete, but no attempt to open it has succeeded.</p><p>Within SCP-177 are a series of small, rocky caves, arranged in a fairly consistent pattern. It is believed that these caves were originally intended as living quarters for some sort of mine workers and their families during the later years of uranium mining operations. Analysis of several random pieces of furniture found within shows traces of wallpaper in various hues, as well as patches of carpeting where the floor was not covered in rubble and debris.</p><p>SCP-177 was discovered after reports from multiple hikers led Foundation agents to investigate the area. The difficult access made it impractical to evacuate civilians until late, but documentation on the tunnels' existence was all that was needed to enact an Anomalous Item Containment Procedure.</p><p>Incident 177-I: On ██/██/████, four volunteers were put into contact with SCP-177 due to them having an active interest in old mines. Three were transported to SCP-177 by helicopter while two were allowed to continue hiking towards their destination by themselves. An eventual rescue mission was launched once those two had lost their way and made contact with other hikers who reported hearing screaming coming from their direction. During this patrol they heard sounds similar to gunshots coming from within SCP-177, prompting an evacuation from all personnel within a one kilometer radius. No anomalous entities were encountered on this trip through SCP-177. Personnel involved reported feeling strongly uncomfortable about entering any part of SCP-177 thereafter.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
