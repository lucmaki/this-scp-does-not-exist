<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-707</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-707 is to be kept at a maximum area of two (2) square meters, inside a containment chamber measuring two (2) square kilometers. Four (4) armed guards are to be stationed at the entrance to SCP-707's containment chamber. Guards are to carry standard issue pistols and an epinephrine syringe at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-707 is a platform in the shape of a two (2) square meter area. Currently, the platform seems to be unoccupied, but the walls and floor of SCP-707 are opaque, making it impossible to determine if this is an intentional feature or not. The interior of the platform does not contain any physical objects, although there are four (4) large metallic bars stretching across the interior of the platform.</p><p>SCP-707 was discovered when local residents reporting hearing someone screaming. When Foundation agents located the screaming subject, they found him hanging from one of the four metallic bars. The subject was brought to Site 19 for interrogation and was deemed a Level 3/707 situation. The subject was given Class-A amnestics and released outside SCP-707.</p><p>Interview 707-1:</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ██████</p><p>Interviewee: Subject ████ ███</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Dr. ██████: So you're inside SCP-707? What do you know about it?</p><p>Subject: I don't know anything about it! I've been in here for an hour at least, and I haven't seen anything! Why won't you let me out?! What kind of experiment is this?!</p><p>[END LOG]</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
