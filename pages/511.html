<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-511</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-511 is to be located in an airtight chamber with a single air filter capable of removing 99.999% of Earthly particulate matter, equipped with two fan systems capable of drawing 100 cubic meters per minute of fresh oxygen at maximum power, and a biological quarantine unit with single open window. The chamber itself is to be placed on a foundation that would allow for easy repair and maintenance by Foundation personnel. Surveillance teams are to maintain a 24/7 watch on SCP-511.</p><p>Any personnel entering SCP-511's containment area except for authorized research personnel are to wear radiation detection equipment. No person is to enter SCP-511's containment area unless they have been successfully tested on prior to entering the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-511 is a large chamber with four walls, a ceiling and a floor, measuring in total 215 m x 175 m. The chamber is lined with steel, and is pressurized to an approximate amount of 5 atmospheres.</p><p>On the ceiling of SCP-511's containment area are three concentric circles containing lighted red lights spaced equally apart from each other with a diameter of exactly 2.3 meters. The lights flash on and off in synchrony with the containment unit's internal clock, but do not emit any visible light.</p><p>SCP-511 does not appear to possess any objects that would be capable of moving independently of itself, such as vehicles, animals or even persons. In fact, any activity within the chamber appears to be limited to the act of viewing SCP-511; it does not seem to respond to physical stimuli (including pain), nor does it seem to possess a means of detecting or even transmitting its environment. It has been observed to display very little variation in behavior over multiple recordings and tests have been able to detect no discernible pattern except for the flashing lights on its ceiling.</p><p>It is impossible for any person to enter SCP-511's containment area except through SCP-512. SCP-512 maintains a mystical barrier that prevents travel between it and SCP-511, thus preventing access through natural means. Any attempts to bypass this barrier reactivates SCP-512's active ability; anyone passing through will be physically ejected from the containment room by strong air pressure.</p><p>The only successful method of entry into SCP-511's containment area has been by means of SCP-512 itself. It has been discovered that placing oneself within SCP-512 causes certain parts of one's body to disappear completely; these areas include the hands and legs, but also portions of facial features such as noses and ears as well as eyes and ears themselves (studies have shown that around 30% of test subjects lose both eyes at once). There has been no recorded instance where either their head or neck had vanished entirely without leaving some trace left behind; however, these missing parts do not reappear until the subject emerges back out of SCP-512 (most often after the process takes between 8 minutes and 48 hours); otherwise they remain missing indefinitely (all recovered fragments have since been reattached properly). The effects of visiting SCP-512 are permanent so long as they are allowed to remain inside its boundaries; however, due to various psychological factors which prevent many test subjects from staying within its boundaries while a portion remains missing, it is currently believed that it would take an extremely dedicated individual to remain within it for more than several days at most. Testing shows that individuals who have entered SCP-512 at least once can memorize specific details on what happened within its borders during each visit (see Addendum 512), though no subject has ever been able to accurately recall all events related back upon exiting again.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
