<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-581</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-57 is to be used as a maintenance and storage facility for SCP-581.</p><p>SCP-581 has been registered as a missing person case with the Foundation's Regional Missing Persons Bureau in the state of New York. Contacts have been made to the local police department to monitor the case. In the event of its discovery, Protocol 581-P has been enacted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-581 is a black 1991 Ford Mustang convertible. Its current location and identity are currently unknown.</p><p>SCP-581 is one year older than its appearance would suggest. It is currently assumed to have been stolen while still in production by a third party, though no evidence has been found to support this theory.</p><p>Note: While SCP-581 appears to be functionally identical to its current design, due to the lack of information regarding its manufacture date, it is impossible to verify the appearance of SCP-581 prior to its disappearance.</p><p>SCP-581 acquired its name when classified as such by the Foundation's Regional Missing Persons Bureau. Due to the unusual nature of SCP-581's anomalous properties, Protocol 581-P was enacted for its containment on 6/4/1911.</p><p>Protocol 581-P was implemented after six months of failure in attempts to recapture SCP-581 (See Addendum). Each repetition of Protocol 581-P has resulted in a different outcome, though all tests thus far have failed due to SCP-581's location and our inability to capture it in camera. Attempts to track SCP-581 through GPS or phone signals have proven futile due to repeated interference from sources unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
