<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-647</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has compiled a list of all establishments that have ever served tacos in the greater Los Angeles area, and are actively monitoring any new occurrences of tacos being served. Due to the scope of this phenomenon, the use of amnestics is considered sufficient, though it is recommended that operatives not familiar with the code be allowed to participate in the operation.</p><p>As for retrieval, it is noted that the best method would be to entice one of the entities to exit its containment and place it within a vehicle (such as a patrol car). This is currently impossible due to said entities' resistance to entering vehicles due to the low temperatures and lack of oxygen. Nonetheless, it is believed that the Foundation will be able to find a way to successfully procure one at some point in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-647 is a series of phenomena known as "Taco," which in this case refers to the consumption of tacos by entities found to currently inhabit the area. These entities have varying length and breadth of existence, although it is believed that there are over 300 instances all located within Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Upon consumption of a taco containing the flesh of these entities, an effect often referred to as a "high" occurs, resulting in an increase in the entity's intelligence and physical abilities and loss of individualism. Aside from being an improvement from baseline human levels, these abilities seem to influence them in positive ways, allowing them to both better interact with each other and understand their environment better.</p><p>It is worth noting that there does not appear to be any discernable reason for why only the individuals who consume these tacos are affected.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
