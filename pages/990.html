<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-990</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-990 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, with two (2) copies of the written standard for humanoids found in Volume Two of the Humanoid Containment Manual. SCP-990 is not allowed to be held outside its cell except during testing. Any humans observed approaching SCP-990 are to be detained and interviewed under armed guard.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-990 is a human male of fair complexion, 5'10" tall, weighing 140 lbs. It has a bald head, with a small patch of hair on the back of its head that has been dyed white. SCP-990 has blue eyes and wears reading glasses.</p><p>SCP-990 displays numerous abilities:</p><p>SCP-990 has shown no anomalous capability outside of its ability to communicate with spoken language, which appears to be limited to English.</p><p>SCP-990 was captured on ██/██/19██ after it was found in an abandoned building in ████, Oregon. It had been impounded by a local animal shelter from the remains of a house fire, which apparently killed its family (see Interview Logs 990-A and 990-B). SCP-990 was released from custody after it was determined not to be a threat to the public.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
