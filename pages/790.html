<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-790</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The general containment parameters for SCP-790 are the same as those of a standard Euclid classification. It is to be held in a vault at Storage Site-77, and three armed guards are to be posted outside of its chamber 24 hours a day.</p><p>The Foundation has no sensitive information regarding SCP-790. All personnel involved with SCP-790 are to be treated in a manner identical to that of amnestic patients undergoing psychogenic amnesia treatment, including a complete and thorough psychiatric evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-790 is a large, white wooden table measuring approximately 4 meters long and 3 meters wide. The surface of the table is covered in scratches and minor cracks which have no apparent cause or reason. Small metal hooks have been implanted at various points along the length of the table; these are connected to a small black box about 1 cm in size. The table appears to be alive, responding to verbal commands and displays an animistic personality (see below). The table also has an internal clockwork self-rearranging mechanism which activates when commanded by an uninvolved victim.</p><p>A person will enter SCP-790's containment chamber, approach the table, and begin making incantations over it using their hands. The victim will then reach into their pocket, withdraw a green piece of paper from within and place it on the table before retreating from the room. SCP-790 will then begin reading this paper aloud, sometimes uttering vocalizations such as large sighs and groans in response to parts of the text. When prompted by a specific word (e.g. "Him"), SCP-790 will deliver a message in [DATA EXPUNGED]. When prompted by another specific word (e.g "Gentlemen"), it will recite a short poem from 18th century travel journal entries written by Sir Walter Scott (SCP-079).</p><p>The victims report that they can feel their skin becoming warmer than normal, before finding themselves transported back in time to approximately 200 years ago when several members of the Paxton family were killed (15 males and 12 females) through an unknown means, with all but two bodies recovered via live burial near █████, Scotland while two were found elsewhere in England. All of these bodies had dried bloodstains on their clothing consistent with struggle or being dragged over long distances as well as signs of asphyxiation following strangulation involving cloth or rope around neck or body</p><p>It is unknown where the words "Gentlemen", "Him" and "Saints" originated from but notes taken during interviews suggest that no one remembers writing them on paper prior to entering SCP-980. Attempts to remove these phrases have proven unsuccessful due to its strong animistic nature.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
