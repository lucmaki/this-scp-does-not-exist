<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-347</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-347 is to be contained in Research Area 42, to be monitored by security cameras. When SCP-347 begins to attack personnel and property, it is to be destroyed using the procedures outlined in Doctor █████'s report.</p><p>SCP-347's physical properties were not deleted and are currently being studied by Doctor █████'r███ and other personnel assigned to SCP-347.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-347 is a large number of SCP-███ instances. From the outside, its surface appears to resemble a blank wall, with no visible entrance or exit points. However, its composition has been altered such that it is now capable of altering itself to fit any dimensional environment.</p><p>Once a given environment is been established, SCP-347 will begin to organize itself into a city; this process takes approximately twenty (20) minutes to complete. Once the city has been completed, it will become impossible for personnel inside it to communicate with one another. Researchers within the city are able to communicate with each other over radio, as well as with personnel outside of the city.</p><p>Once assembled, objects in the city have properties consistent with their mass and dimensions when in an environment where they are not anomalous. The only item that does not conform to these rules is SCP-347; this state prevents its destruction. Smaller D-Class personnel will not be affected by SCP-347's anomalous properties and can be destroyed by SCP-347; however, destruction of large structures such as buildings will result in their growth until they are destroyed.</p><p>The origin of SCP-347 remains unknown; it was created by Doctor █████'r███ after an experiment involving SCP-███ caused his assistants to disappear and appear in an extra dimension. These assistants were found later within an altered state similar to that of SCP-███ and were designated SCP-347.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
