<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-846</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation personnel may enter SCP-846 through a secondary access point in the basement. A second door will be sealed off via Foundation security devices if any other civilians or personnel are inside the building.</p><p>Foundation drones have been constructed to store and contain instances of SCP-846-1. Any person inside SCP-846-1 when it is sealed off by the Foundation will become an instance of SCP-846-2 and be taken into Foundation custody. Only a few instances of SCP-846-2 have manifested as living persons, although they display signs of being delusional and/or emotionally unstable. Dr. ███████ will provide psychological reports of every instance once they have been contained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-846 is a tanning salon located in ██████, ██. As of now, the building appears to be abandoned. A single door leads into the basement and has been sealed off with a Foundation security device. The front of the building is empty and appears to be an open space.</p><p>On 12/18/20██, SCP-846 emitted anomalous effects which caused ███ civilians inside the building to become instances of SCP-846-2. Each instance was affected by a different color of SCP-846. This effect only lasted for 0.5 seconds, after which time the humans disappeared back into their body.</p><p>SCP-846-2 have primarily manifested as delusional individuals (see Addendum 846-1). They claim to have lived inside SCP-846 during its active period between 11/21/2012 and 12/18/20██, when they became affected as adults. Most SCP-846-2 exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia, with several displaying signs of hypochondria or anorexia nervosa.</p><p>Dr. ███████ will provide psychological reports from all instances of SCP-846 once they are contained and stabilized.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
