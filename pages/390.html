<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-390</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Subject is to be held with sufficient restraint to prevent escape and monitored for any possible injuries. Subjects are to be fed standard nutrition and provide with access to reading material for recreation purposes. Subjects should also be observed for any behavioural changes, especially in regards to thirst.</p><p></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-390 is a male of estimated Caucasian descent, aged 25. Subject does not respond to his name and does not acknowledge the presence of guards or researchers in any way. His behaviour when approached by security personnel is to be vague, disinterested and non-responsive to questions regarding his identity or location.</p><p>Subject has been observed to react with disdain at attempts to interview him, and will often become hostile and attempt to assault guards attempting access to his cell.</p><p>Subject was found on ██/██/1968 as a 16 year old juvenile in ████████, ██████, after reports were raised that he had been hired as an electrician on a low wage rate. Subject had been reported missing by ████████████ prior to this incident. According to investigation reports, subjects parents' home was burned down several days earlier by the British Provisional Irish Republican Army [PIGS], and subject had not participated in the event.</p><p>Investigation Report: SCP-390 is aloof towards any form of investigation offered or requested, but shows a preference for classical literature such as Jane Austen, John Ruskin and William Morris. Subjects dedication to literature is unparalleled in mental health facilities currently operating within the United Kingdom.</p><p>Through reading material provided by facility staff, SCP-390 has shown minimal interest in politics or current events affecting Britain's Anglo-Celtic ethnocentric racial groups. Instead subjects main interests have revolved around fictional authors such as William Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats.</p><p>Interview Log 390-A</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr █████: Good evening Mr Robinson</p><p>SCP-390: Evening Dr █████</p><p>Dr █████: What are your hobbies? Your favourite books? I've noticed you read quite a lot.</p><p>SCP-390: I was enjoying my leisure time before… (subject begins to cry) Can I talk now?</p><p>Dr █████: Of course, what would you like to discuss?</p><p>SCP-390: My girlfriend… The last time they took me out…. She was pregnant… They killed their own kid! No one sees it but them! They just don't get it! They can't see it! But it's there! You see it too! It's there… They kill people and eat their own babies! How could you stand there and watch!? What kind of mother kills her child!? And why did no one do anything about it!? No one stood up for them! No one cared! No one knows what it's like to have your own child taken from you and slaughtered! You don't know what it's like! You can't know what it's like! You don't understand our pain!! We are being slaughtered for no reason!! Why did we make so much hate inside ourselves? Why did we let them take everything we ever wanted?! We could be happy here!! We could be free here but we chose to hate people who aren't like us! Did we really have no choice?! Was there never a way out??? If there were maybe we would've done something differently… Anything different than what they made us do… We didn't realize what they were doing until it was too late.. They said they were going to free us but just look around you see all of young white men like me locked away with nothing more than a sense of possibility kept inside you! Was this REALLY freedom? Was this really what we wanted?! What did we do? Who did we become?! We never knew these things would come true.. We never thought this kind of thing could happen. We never could imagine that no matter how hard we try or how much our lives turn out exceptionally well nothing will ever change.. Our parents will always love us ……..But us… Do you even care anymore?? Was this love or was this just a coincidence?? How long can we keep pretending that every moment isn't terrifying enough for each of us?? I don't know what makes our lives better!! I don't know if anything could ever make me feel okay again…I'm scared I'm just so scared I wonder if everyone else feels the same way..I wonder if everyone thinks their life is better than ours in some ways.. Everyone seems so happy but me… why am I the only one who feels betrayed!? Why do I want revenge against people who deserve nothing less than death when all i want is justice against them? We could all live together.. Free from hate forever!! That's all I want isn't it?! Justice!! Just give me justice instead of passionless suffering filled with endless hostility isn't that possible? Isn't justice usually upheld every once in a while isn't it?! Isn't honor enough for any person regardless of race or religion let alone nationality?? How come people let laws go unfulfilled over and over again without taking any sort of action whatsoever??? We could live together peacefully without any wars or conflicts between each other…."Shut up Tommy.. Shut up I'm tired of hearing yourself"…"You wouldn't understand"…"Just shut up"…"Don't bring up my past"…"Why should i listen?"…"It's not fair"…"You're not living"…"Why should i listen?"…"Please just stop".. "I tried…." "Do you even care?" "Listen, please just listen" "Will anybody listen?" "Someone must stop him!!" "…Is nobody listening?!" "Can you hear me?" "No one cares anymore!!" "You wont understand until its too late." "What does that mean?" "…Let go Rob-" "…Donnelly quit trash talking me!" "Come on guys he stops talking doesn't mean anything!" "…How long does he have then?" "…I swear on my life that he won't be seeing tomorrow night" "…Why'd u do that robski!?"(subject begins crying anew) "-Your dead liar-" "…Jimmy can you close your eyes please?" "…My mouth is sealed" "(sighs)"(subject still crying…) <End Log></p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
