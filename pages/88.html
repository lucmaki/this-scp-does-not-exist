<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-88</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-88 is kept in a reinforced vault at Site-18. All electronic measures and sensors must be disabled in the vicinity of the chamber housing SCP-88.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-88 is a paper-filigreed brass chamber pot of Japanese origin, measuring 65 cm tall and 66 cm wide. As SCP-88 is not connected to any electrical outlet, its anomalous properties are theorized to be a result of radio waves. SCP-88's anomalous properties are measured as such:</p><p>+ Show Notes - Hide Notes There are two theories regarding the exact nature of SCP-88's properties. The first theory states that the anomalous properties of SCP-88 originate from electromagnetic waves, possibly originating from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). While this theory accounts for the unusually high power output, it does not explain the lack of electromagnetic radiation in the immediately surrounding area. The second theory hypothesizes that the components preventing SCP-88 from becoming active are only weak enough to prevent its activation. This would require that the effects are actively suppressed by a nearby item, likely a terrestrial television transmitter or radio frequency amplifier.</p><p>Regardless of how it was created, SCP-88 possesses several unique properties:</p><p>It is unknown why these properties were incorporated into SCP-88; experts theorize that either its anomalous properties were an unintended effect or it was made by an individual with particular expertise in filigree brass casting.</p><p>The anomalous properties of SCP-88 appear to activate when an object capable of emitting electromagnetic radiation (such as an electromagnetic wave generator) is in direct proximity to it. Firing a gun toward SCP-88 will create visible electromagnetic waves corresponding to the muzzle flash, with higher magnification proving that SCP-88 itself is generating shockwaves. However, actual contact with SCP-88 has not been verified and is thus classified as unproven.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
