<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-379</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-379 is to be contained in a secure locker. Locker access is restricted to Level 5 staff members who are ideologically opposed to the use of any alphabetical arrangement, as well as supervisors and researchers where said arrangement has made an appearance in research data. Access to SCP-379 is permitted only through approved testing personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-379 is a paperback book entitled “Hidden Alphabet: An A-Z Anthology of the Uncanny”. The cover features an illustrated portrait of an unidentified human male wearing a tattered hat and overcoat, with a bushy beard and mustache. A paper label bearing the title “The Hidden Alphabet Book” is present on the cover. The title page is blank save for a single handwritten annotation.</p><p>Any attempt to retrieve SCP-379 using SCP-379's original access code (see Document XXXX) will result in its destruction by an entity resembling the subject depicted on the cover. In addition, said entity will interact with any animal capable of reproduction in the manner described. This entity is not hostile to Foundation personnel, and has not been observed to harm animals or humans outside of experimentation purposes.</p><p>SCP-379 was obtained from Boston Public Library via Interlibrary Loan several days after its destruction began on 6/15/1998. Test log 379-1 details further information about SCP-379's destruction process.</p><p>Document 379-1:</p><p>In early 1998, an elderly woman discovered a dormant anomalous object while walking her dog in Boston's North End neighborhood, just prior to this object starting its active cycle. She summoned local authorities who arrested her on charges related to possession of contraband materials (presumably pornographic magazines or books). She was released after being placed under house arrest for six weeks due to her age, and has since refused interview requests regarding her initial discovery of SCP-379. During this time period, she proceeded to regularly clean and maintain the area around SCP-379 through scouring and mowing activities. When asked about her actions, the subject claimed that she had recently moved from Croatia and was unable to read English at the time of discovery, though this could not be verified by Foundation surveillance teams present in her home during this time period. Around noon on 6/15/1998, just prior to SCP-379's active cycle commencing, she attempted to read it as she had done several times before without incident; it then exploded in midair, severely injuring her leg in the process before falling back into nearby bushes and taking root there once again.</p><p>Document 379-2:</p><p>During testing on 7/3/1998, two adult red foxes were presented with two separate metal pots containing food intended for each animal individually. One pot was decorated with a handwritten message reading “Don't be afraid!”; subsequent tests produced similar results as described in Document XXXX. The other pot was decorated with three letters arranged in no particular order: “a b c” and “z”. Each fox viewed both objects simultaneously before choosing which one they would eat from; no other animals were present during the testing session, nor did any other objects explode upon contact with them (including another copy of SCP-379). After analysis proved inconclusive regarding these findings, testing was halted until 7/5/1998 at which point eight additional test subjects were introduced within various locations throughout three separate cities: New York City (subsequent document), Chicago, Illinois (subsequent document), and Toronto, Canada (subsequent document). Containment procedures were enacted immediately on all subjects involved following this last test; despite being present outside of Site 19 at time of termination per containment protocol K Tango Thirteen (See Incident Logs). All subjects reported feelings of "fear" immediately prior to their deaths.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
