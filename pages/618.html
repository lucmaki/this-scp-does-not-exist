<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-618</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-618 is to be contained in a 1.5 m x 1.5 m x 1-meter hot cell, with walls of 10 cm and a ceiling of 15 cm, made of reinforced concrete. The hot cell must be well insulated against sound and outside temperatures are to be regulated to prevent freezing. SCP-618 is to be stored in a brown paper box, inside of which is to be placed an oxygen mask for the duration of testing and transport.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-618 is a ca. 30 cm tall, translucent plastic vial with a rubber stopper and an attached threaded top. The label reads "Solvent Mixing." The stopper is corked and sealed, and cannot be opened without destroying the object. SCP-618 can be dissolved in any solvent (including water) by heating to a boiling point and adding the solvent to the contents of the bottle (see below for details on the virus).</p><p>Since being placed in containment, SCP-618 has undergone large changes in appearance and behavior. The product appears to have been manufactured in ████████, Italy, before ██████, when it was unknown to the Foundation.</p><p>SCP-618 will remain inert until it is actively dissolved, at which point it will become activated. Activation occurs via several methods:</p><p>The virus may also be introduced into humans as "Suspicious Looking Package" (SOLP), but it does not possess any anomalous effects on those who are immune to its effects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
