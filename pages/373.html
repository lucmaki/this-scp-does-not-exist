<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-373</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-373 is to be held in a secure locker. No other specimens of SCP-373 have been recorded by Foundation intelligence, and it is unlikely that any more will exist. Specimens are labeled according to their size, with the largest specimen being Item-373-Large, the second large being Item-373-Small, and the rest being Item-373-X.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-373 is a series of veins which have been surgically constructed on the surface of human male and female forearms. They are surgically linked, allowing blood to travel between them as if they were one large vein.</p><p>SCP-373 is believed to be a product of X-ray technology dating back to the mid-20th century. However, the origin of SCP-373's anomalous properties is unknown.</p><p>Any person with access to an X-ray can view an SCP-373 specimen. The large human male and female specimens are superficially identical from a distance, but when viewed closely (and often in black and white X-ray images), the two specimens are clearly distinguishable by their diameters. As observed so far, the largest specimen has a diameter of approximately 200 cm, while the smallest has a diameter of approximately 20 cm.</p><p>The procedure for obtaining an SCP-373 specimen is as follows:</p><p>As far as tissues go, it is remarkable that a vein would be used for such an explicit purpose; however, this product seems fairly durable given its age.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
