<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-840</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-840 is contained in a standard containment cell at Site 18. The artifact is to be handled by on-site staff during testing and by Foundation agents under the pretense of maintenance or repairs. Instances of SCP-840-1 are contained within a standard size storage locker.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-840 is a steel tank manufactured in 1954 by the San Diego Wastewater Company. The mottos "San Diego's Water Source" and "City of Sunshine" are engraved on the front and sides of SCP-840, respectively. SCP-840 has an interior of 2.5 meters x 1.1 meters in area and is made up of two fuel drums welded together to form an inverted human torso with legs protruding from both sides, connected to a steel circular plow mounted to the rear rim of the tank.</p><p>SCP-840 was recovered from a Foundation safehouse after being reported missing by the parents of ██████ █████, a teenage boy murdered by SCP-840-1 at his house in [REDACTED]. A motion sensor in the basement had been tripped when █████ attempted to pick up a Popsicle stick; following lockdown, SCP-840-1 was found attempting to dig its way into the wall around the base of the sensor. The body was found buried inside SCP-840 below a layer of sand, despite it being unable to produce any tools capable of digging such an efficient tunnel.</p><p>SCP-840-1 is humanoid in appearance and measures 1 meter tall. It has dark blue skin, three digits on each hand, and wears [DATA EXPUNGED] boots. When initially discovered, most signs pointed towards SCP-840-1 being sapient, but this is not confirmed due to its inability to produce any tools or other items it could have used for construction. DNA analysis indicates that SCP-840-1 is related to various species native to California and Mexico; however, no known modern human sharing these ancestors has yet been identified.</p><p>SCP-840's anomalous properties manifest when knowledge regarding human digestion is introduced into its environment. If food is placed within 10 meters of SCP-840, it will attempt to consume using its built in digestive system, described as a series of small holes drilled into the body and surrounded by flesh similar in consistency to stomach lining. The organ does not produce any new digestive substances nor require air vents or anything similar; instead, materials are simply excreted through them every 30 minutes or so until full consumption occurs.</p><p>After consumption has completed, SCP-820 will attempt to remove all parts suitable for reproduction from its surroundings via tunneling and sawing through concrete or metal objects (referred as "digging"). Any organic material removed during this process will begin producing copies of itself at a rate determined by its mass (the first instance produced will be identical to itself but only measure 1/10th size). Due to this behavior and how difficult it is for humans to live underground (due to risk of collapse), Foundation agents embedded within various building maintenance teams were effectively able to contain most instances prior to their ability to reproduce growing large enough for containment breaches. Currently there are over 7██ instances currently contained within Site 18 alone with another 5██ under Foundation supervision. Though maintaining this at an adequate level has proven difficult due to their efficient tunneling skills, the lack of mass caused by these reproductions make them extremely difficult for current containment measures or reclassification as Euclid class artifacts.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
