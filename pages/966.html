<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-966</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-966 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site 19. Staff members are not to touch SCP-966 unless they are wearing gloves or other protective clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-966 is a wooden toy car, constructed to resemble the ███████ brand of car. It is currently missing its tires and wheels, as well as its driver (see Addendum 966-1). The model number is ████████ A-2 (see Addendum 966-2 for further information).</p><p>If any person other than SCP-966's original driver touches SCP-966, a manifestation event will occur within three hours. There is no apparent physical or mechanical mechanism that triggers this event; it is purely a manifestation event. The manifestations take place in different locations each time.</p><p>When a manifestation occurs, it takes the form of an adult human male dressed in a ████████ uniform, apparently watching over the individual who touched SCP-966. They appear to be humanoid, but their shape and size are variable, appearing to be roughly 4 m tall with a mass of approximately 1 ton. They are capable of speaking English to whoever touched SCP-966.</p><p>SCP-966's original driver has been designated SCP-966-1 (see Addendum 966-3). They are not affected by the manifestations and have stated that they have no memory of touching SCP-966 prior to their detention.</p><p>The entity can manifest anywhere within Site 19's range of view, although it prefers to manifest near the front door, if possible. It can only manifest once per day, and seems to remain present until all manifestations have occurred. The entity has not been observed interacting with other personnel in any way.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
