<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-95</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-95 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Bio-Site-17. It is currently not under any sort of security protocol, but this is to change in the near future. SCP-95's cell chamber is to be checked daily for any signs of damage and or tampering. SCP-95's food is to be watered down to prevent corrosion, as well as its water must be tested regularly and replaced as needed. Any type of metal or other metallic object is to be removed before entering SCP-95's cell chamber at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-95 is a female human, 34 years of age. It is capable of speaking fluently in English and Russian, but has displayed no other linguistic learning. Its skin has been reported to be extremely cold, averaging 50 degrees Fahrenheit below what an average human body temperature would be. While SCP-95's anomalous properties have not manifested themselves in tests with non-humanoids, it is still advised that this subject be avoided by all non-humans due to its highly corrosive properties towards anything not made out of metal or some similar material.</p><p>SCP-95's primary anomalous effect is its extreme resistance to corrosion. Any metallic object placed in contact with SCP-95 will instantaneously begin to corrode at an extremely rapid rate, resulting in a breakdown of the material into smaller and smaller pieces unless such an object is removed from SCP-95's presence. This effect will not occur if the metallic object is completely covered by SCP-95 at the time of exposure. The corrosion will continue regardless of the location of the metallic object (not restricted to physical contact) and does not seem to be affected by any "shielding", such as surrounding stone or walls made from reinforced concrete or titanium. If SCP-95 is no longer available for an object to corrode, it will rapidly decompose back into its original form at which point, it will become inert and useless for any further use until replaced by a new object prior to SCP-95's next remanifestation.</p><p>SCP-95 was first contained on ██/██/████ at a shopping mall in ████████ when it caused damage to the majority of the mall after attempting to escape containment due to its containment being accidentally breached. SCP-95 was contained again shortly thereafter and held at Bio-Site 17, where it was treated and studied by researchers in order to determine its anomalous properties.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
