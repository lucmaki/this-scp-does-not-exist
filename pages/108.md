<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-108</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-108 are to be monitored through surveillance cameras (stationary and mobile), tracking devices, and remote hacking. The Space Department has been called in to inspect instances of SCP-108 and make repairs as necessary, with the help of a Foundation civilian contractor.</p><p>Researchers are to be on hand for any unusual activity detected. Video footage is to be downloaded to a Foundation database for analysis.</p><p>Due to the recent discovery of several SCP-108s located outside the solar system, additional research has been assigned to SCP-112-A.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-108 designates a floating, rectangular structure in space with no detectable means of propulsion. Current theories attribute SCP-108's appearance to the gravitational force exerted on it by a passing solar system.</p><p>SCP-108 does not appear as a discrete entity, but rather as a three-dimensional projection of random geometric shapes belonging to the limited set [DATA EXPUNGED]. These shapes are predominantly squares and rectangles, although certain examples may include other polygonal figures.</p><p>The Foundation has observed that SCP-108 has no up or down orientation, but is instead completely level across all manifestations. It can be seen from any point in the solar system, regardless of its position relative to the sun. SCP-108 has not been observed to move, change shape, or disappear in any way.</p><p>It is unknown if all instances of SCP-108 are identical, but they do exhibit several similarities:</p><p>The first reported instance of SCP-108 was discovered by Foundation radar installations in 1904 in the Pleiades star cluster. At this time there were still only five known moons orbiting Jupiter. All satellites orbiting Uranus and Neptune had yet to be discovered. In addition, telescopes at this time were unable to detect objects in orbit around Earth and Venus. However, taking into account the time required for an object to leave Earth's gravity well and reach Uranus or Neptune (approximately 41 years at these speeds) and considering calculations for Jupiter's orbits (approximately 25 years at these speeds), it can be concluded that this first report did not indicate the existence of an anomalous object until after 1915.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
