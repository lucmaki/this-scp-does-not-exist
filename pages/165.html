<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-165</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-165 are to be kept in a standard containment locker. They may be attached to walls, doors or other surfaces, but should not be attached directly to the ceiling if possible.</p><p>Each instance of SCP-165 is to be monitored by at least one researcher at all times. Researchers must turn off their personal sound devices before entering a room with an instance of SCP-165 installed; it is recommended that both researchers enter the room at the same time. When removing an instance from an item, the researchers must pause for 10 seconds before removing. When removing an instance from a wall, the researchers must apply two coats of paint on the surface opposite the instance within five minutes of removal.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-165 is a collection of six pieces of cardboard with the words "A·B·C" written on them in black marker. Each piece of SCP-165 is a different length and width, however they are all exactly one meter in length and width.</p><p>Instances of SCP-165 will cause any surface they are installed on to spontaneously morph into a design. The design will be effectively invisible until the instance is removed and put back where it was before it was placed; the only way to see it when not using SCP-165 is to stare at the surface through binoculars or a microscope.</p><p>SCP-165 can be moved freely across surfaces by attaching one end to the item being measured and the other end to something sturdy. It will not fit into anything smaller than an A4 sheet (11.7 cm x 17.9cm). Instances cannot be removed from small items without first prying them off with pliers or similar tools; it is possible to tear them, but exits remain intact.</p><p>Instances can be moved freely between items, but if two objects are connected together via screws, nails, etc., the instance will leave both items and go straight through the wall into another room of Site ██.</p><p>The following table lists the difference between each item when measuring the distance traveled:</p><p>Item Measured Distance To Traveled Type Notes Wall 27m 1m If screwed into, instances cannot travel through walls after initial placement Moved from Table 36 cm 12 cm Travels through most solid materials Table 35 cm 11 cm Travels through most solid materials Candle 32 cm 6 cm Travels through most air and gases Scissors 15 cm 2 cm Travels through all materials Baggage Claim Ticket 0m 0m Doesn't travel Paper Towel 3–5 cm 1m 2–3m Travels through all materials</p><p>If an object containing an instance of SCP-165 is pressed against a wall while standing above or below it, and if the item holds weight in the direction pressed against (e.g., holding the bottom of a trolley against the ground and pushing up), then the instance will travel upwards at approximately 210 m/s by means of suction (see Addendum 165-A). No instances have been found traveling vertically upwards under these conditions.</p><p>When measuring distances for items containing instances that have been detached from their original item and put on another item, if more than one entity is used as a measuring tool, then distance traveled should be divided by the total number of entities used as tools. In this example, if four people measure an average distance of 35 centimeters, then 35 centimeters should be divided by four, resulting in 5 centimeters per person. This does not apply to items held in your hand; you may use one hand for measuring purposes. If you do so, you must press down on the object being measured with your non-measuring hand to apply suction.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
