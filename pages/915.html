<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-915</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-915 is currently uncontained. Its "house" has been emptied of all materials that could be used as a flammable source and is now the focus of an investigation to prevent future incidents.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-915 is a bicolored domestic shorthair cat with a dark gray coat, blue eyes, and white paws. It appears to have very little in the way of physical strength. However, it can detect at least one flammable source from over 300 meters away, and has responded to this ability artificially by combing its fur into a more pointed shape when combustible materials have been nearby.</p><p>SCP-915 also appears to be capable of detecting an ignition source from even greater distances (its wounds will heal much faster if it detects an ignition source). This may be attributed to the fact that it does not appear to suffer any significant injuries in the absence of fire, despite being struck by various objects, including firearms; its bones remain unmarred. SCP-915 seems to prefer not to use its enhanced senses for such tasks and often uses a clumsier method or simply ignores the stimulus entirely.</p><p>When ignited, SCP-915 will react by attempting to find its owner. If unable or unwilling to communicate or resist, it will attempt to exit through the nearest window or door. The amount of damage it inflicts upon itself while doing so varies based on how long it is trapped inside and has been observed varying between "minor discomfort" and "severely disfigured." Even when unconscious, SCP-915's fur remains arranged around its mouth as though trying to protect it from itself.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
