<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-420</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The entire province of Bower County (U.S.A.) is to be enclosed within a large containment area, designated Area 420. Access to this area is to be strictly controlled; all personnel entering the Area are to carry with them written permission from O-5, Denys Arcus.</p><p>No less than two guards are to be stationed at all times in Area 420; any personnel attempting to visit the area unauthorized are to be detained immediately and then amnesticised. Any personnel found attempting to exit Area 420 after leaving the containment area are not to be allowed to leave the country alive. All interviews of eyewitnesses in Area 420 should take place in a soundproofed room at Site-15; this is due to the fact that constant screaming and moaning can induce psychological trauma upon those nearby.</p><p>All witnesses interviewed within Area 420 shall wear earplugs, and intake agents are to ensure that all witnesses are dosed with as much sodium pentathol as necessary for their mental state; any witness not sufficiently drugged shall have their testimony taken by agents who have been trained specifically for this purpose.</p><p>Any information on SCP-420 which can be obtained from physical evidence left in Area 420 is to be taken immediately, regardless of whether such information has significant historical value.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-420 is a large and imposing structure, located in the mountains of Bower County. The exterior of SCP-420 is made of a white stone with a reddish tint. Within SCP-420 are several rooms and passageways, all of which are lined with floor to ceiling windows. Within these windows, it is possible to observe a mixture of humans, humanoid predatory creatures, and various types of animals being tortured by one another and by the entities within the rooms.</p><p>SCP-420 was first discovered on 4/15/05 by Agent Arcus, who entered Area 420 with his team in order to arrest an entity possessing two Hell Hounds. The entity was successfully arrested and interrogated over three days, before finally revealing its true nature; this entity was able to alter the memories of all personnel in Area 420, causing them to believe that they were employed by various companies within Area 420 (such as "The Company" and "X"), undertaking various tasks for their benefit. This altered memory also caused them to believe that they had been transported outside of Area 420 via teleportation device, and back into the containment area again when time had expired for their task. All living witnesses interviewed believed that this had happened.</p><p>The entity will use any means necessary to prevent personnel from leaving the area; personnel can leave the area after the task has been completed, but they will not recall what they were doing while they were there. Should any escape attempt be made before completing the task, or should any attempt be made by equipment unable to withstand the environment of Area 420 (at which point no equipment will work in Area 420), the environment of Area 420 itself will begin to deteriorate and melt any non-resistant equipment. Personnel attempting to leave Area 420 are advised to carry portable generators; if such equipment is used after an escape attempt has failed, personnel will have their memories altered again so that they believe that the power outage was caused by something outside of Area 420 rather than a failure in equipment.</p><p>In addition to this alteration effect upon personnel, SCP-420 also induces intense psychological trauma upon those who enter it; due to this effect, investigators are strongly advised not to take anyone on assignment until he or she has undergone psychological counseling for at least six months following their arrival at Site-42 (where all personnel awaiting assignment undergo this counseling). Although not inherently harmful as therapy in itself, exposure to SCP-420 is often considered extreme torture.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
