<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-689</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-689 is to be kept in a soundproofed containment chamber at Site-77. Access to this facility is restricted to SCP-689 Head researchers and any other personnel involved with the maintenance of SCP-689. No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-689's containment area without being accompanied by a researcher that does not experience SCP-689's effects, other than for the purpose of transferring items to or from SCP-689. Any audio equipment used in the testing of audio equipment or measuring audio levels of SCP-686 or SCP-689 is subject to confiscation by Site security personnel.</p><p>SCP-689's container has been modified with a built in sound dampning foam padding (see documentation on experiment microphone testing). Outside of testing, this is to be replaced with a simple cardboard box with an air valve leading into the inside of the lid. Note: If for some reason the containment foam should become dislodged, remove it immediately and replace with a new piece before re-entering SCP-689's containment unit, as it may cause damage to the item itself if not properly replaced.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-689 is a mechanical device, constructed of steel with a plastic casing. It measures approximately 19 centimeters long, 8 centimeters wide, and 3 centimeters high. The object is in fact a pair of headphones, except that it has been altered to "plug" into the ears of whoever possesses them instead of being held in the hand.</p><p>SCP-689's anomalous properties are manifested when its container is placed on the ear canal of an adult human subject. When this occurs, it will begin to move around the ear itself and will begin to grow and change over time. After this process begins, objects can be perceived, but not understood. If it is removed from an ear and replaced, SCP-689 will continue to grow; this growth rate and the object's individual changes should be monitored for injury or damage caused by SCP-689's effects.</p><p>This growth process can be observed normally by humans that do not experience SCP-689's effects. The process begins slowly and will show the beginnings of any alterations SCP-689 has undergone until they become stable structures within the instance of SCP-689 making itself at home in the subject's ear canal. This process continues until SCP-689 is fully formed within the instance, which usually takes between twelve (12) hours to two (2) months depending on how large or varied an instance of SCP-689 is created. The object seems to be enamored with discovering new ways for itself to grow in its new environment. While it seems inseparable from the person who owns it and incapable of communicating without this person present, it does seem to possess some degree of sentient awareness as well as independent thought processes; it has been observed acting on its own accord while only attached to one owner.</p><p>The audio equipment attached to SCP-689 appears to influence its changes as well. For example, if the microphone component is damaged beyond repair, any alteration made by the instrument will cease until repairs are made though future alterations once finished should continue normally; likewise with the effect of excessive noise levels felt by either component (see experiment microphone testing).</p><p>After experimentation into audio equipment damage has been completed, all newly created instances of SCP-689 must be stored separately from subjects so as not to interfere with each other's growth process or actions outside their immediate attachment to their owner, such as when an instance seems reluctant to reattach itself to another owner or when several instances attach themselves at once or all at once attempt to speak a single language simultaneously using many different voices at once.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
