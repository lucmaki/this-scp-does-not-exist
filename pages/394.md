<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-394</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The entrance to SCP-394 is to be sealed and guarded at all times. All persons found within the facility are to be placed into restraints, photographed and interrogated. The interrogation is to be conducted through the use of Foundation personnel posing as the Head Master and Special Instructor of a self-defence school. Any students found to have entered SCP-394 while restrained in this manner are to be escorted to Safety Containment Zone-10 and treated as high-risk security risk candidates.</p><p>Upon exiting SCP-394, members of the press and media are to be detained on sight until cleared by Mobile Task Force Psi-4 ("Truth Seekers") for transfer to nearby Omicron 4 ("Xenu's Hideout") for questioning.</p><p>The number of Foundation personnel currently stationed at SCP-394 is currently one (1) Level 4 personnel per two (2) Level 3 personnel, with each additional Level 5 personnel serving as a backup support team. Personnel assigned to SCP-394 must undergo a full psychological evaluation upon arriving at the facility.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-394 is a training facility located at ██████, Tennessee. It is currently known to contain approximately ███ students of all ages. The exterior of the building appears completely normal, with the only difference coming from the fact that all doors and windows appear to be made out of wood.</p><p>If a person enters SCP-394 without being escorted by Foundation personnel and remains within it for more than two hours, a portion of their brain tissue will begin to break down. This process will continue until the subject, who has been given the name "Ron", is left with a warped version of their own brain tissue.</p><p>After twenty-four (24) hours, Ron's new anatomy will reshape itself along the lines of a human body and begin to use its newfound host's genes in order to rebuild themselves into humanoid form. At thirty days, Ronald becomes capable of moving on his own and expressing emotions as if he was still alive. At sixty days, Ronald can speak normally and recognizes basic human social interactions such as greeting someone when they arrive at the SCP-394 premises. Ronald possesses no knowledge or comprehension of what transpired inside SCP-394 prior to his emergence (see addendum).</p><p>Ronald begins using Foundation equipment and information in an attempt to track down a young woman, named Diana Kornfield II., who is believed to have been terminated at their current location due to their child's genetic deformity. Although this information is incorrect (see addendum), these efforts remain necessary due to Ron's unquenchable need for revenge.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
