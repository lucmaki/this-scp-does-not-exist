<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-28</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-28 is kept in a lock box inside the research wing of the British Museum. The object is to be displayed at all times, with no less than two (2) security guards detailed to protect it from theft or damage. Security cameras are to be present at all points where SCP-28 enters or leaves its containment.</p><p>In order to prevent SCP-28 gaining knowledge of modern historical events, researchers handling SCP-28 are to wear full-face covering during their time with the object. Any records that include other than previously approved personnel are to be removed from Foundation databases and destroyed by incineration.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-28 is an 18th century stone sculpture of a naked man. The subject displays the characteristics of early Scottish Iron Age Celts and closely resembles a representation of a deity in early Celtic religion. SCP-28's body is comprised entirely of solid rock, with several veins of small quartz running through its body.</p><p>SCP-28 has no independent life force or thoughts of its own. When activated, however, it will display great intelligence and awareness. If a human being stands directly in front of SCP-28 and attempts to touch them, they will open their eyes and them selves up completely to SCP-28. "Having their soul taken" by SCP-28 is considered the only feasible way to describe the experience of being touched by SCP-28. This does not happen if the person is touching themselves, or another person touching them through clothing.</p><p>SCP-28's knowledge extends far beyond that which can be accessed by living humans, including mathematics and historical facts as well as alien life forms (see Addendum). The creature's knowledge is almost impossible for a human being to comprehend, sometimes requiring many hours for a single question. They have been recorded asking about events that took place over 300 years before their conception.</p><p>SCP-28 was discovered in 1793 on the Isle of Skye by a group led by William Milligan Smith. It became known as "The Cailleach" (the "Old Hag"), but later changed to "Scotland's National Famine" when news broke out about it's true nature. When the Foundation gained custody of SCP-28 in 1956, it was renamed SCP-28 by Dr. ██████ following research into the mythological nature of the object's namesake.</p><p>SCP-28 possesses the following behaviors typical to a creature known as a kilnodomos</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
