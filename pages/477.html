<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-477</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-477 instances have been converted into landscaped gardens. The gardens have been stocked with crop plants and livestock animals appropriate to the climate of the area. Level 4 personnel are to check the instances monthly for damage, and report any changes to Dr. Marengo.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-477 is a dynasty of thirty (30) communally maintained market stalls that, at some point in the past, were marketed as Farm Markets. No information regarding the nature of their origins or the methods with which they were created has been found.</p><p>Any individual encountering an SCP-477 instance is considered to have experienced a hallucinatory event, and will believe that they are observing any one of the following settings:</p><p>A number of testing procedures involving SCP-477 instances have uncovered two anomalous properties of the market stalls:</p><p>SCP-477 was originally contained on an abandoned farm 6 miles east of [REDACTED]. These estates were purchased by SCP-477 from their former owners in exchange for compensation and maintenance. As of ██/██/19██, SCP-477 Market Stalls have expanded to include approximately 346 locations within six (6) states. Foundation agents have remunerated SCP-477 with a monthly allowance and access to necessary materials in order to maintain the majority of markets.</p><p>Update ██/██/19██: In order to increase the amount of comprehensive data available to research groups exploring the properties of SCP-477 instances, Dr. Marengo has engaged in open communication with every marketplace owner. In return, all owners have agreed to allow Foundation personnel to monitor them using advanced cameras. The results show that the majority of owners seem relatively content with their situation, and do not wish for their markets to be contained.</p><p>Analysis of these images shows that the majority of people that pass through these market stalls view them as normal business establishments, even when observation through x-ray imagery clearly shows otherwise. Many instances lie empty for long periods at a time, despite regular appearance by staff members or delivery trucks. Many samples taken of fluid from compartments beneath stall doors have proven negative for any liquid not suitable for human consumption.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
