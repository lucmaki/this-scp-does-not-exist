<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-421</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A perimeter of 2 km has been set up around the object, and is patrolled by five security experts at all times. Radar-tracking equipment is to be installed around an outer radius of 50 km, just outside of the perimeter. A staff of 10 persons is to oversee the operation of the tracking station, along with one nuclear physicist as a liaison to provide assistance in solving any complicated containment issues. As priority one for research is the exploration of moon resources, two rovers are to be constructed and will serve as the habitat for a staff of three individuals.</p><p>The duration of this research project is pending approval from the Ethics Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-421 is a large, dark, floating spherical object, approximately 200 meters in diameter. The surface of the object appears to be made out of an alloy of iron and nickel that is inclined at a 45 degree angle (this is not absolute – the gravity due to the moon’s mass has been calculated to account for this). There are no openings or visible means of access on any part of the object. The surface appears to be completely smooth, but with a texture that gently rolls inwards towards the center.</p><p>On the side facing Earth there is a single etched symbol that has been consistently estimated as being approximately 2 meters tall by 4 meters wide. This symbol is stylized to look like a face with large red eyes, with two long horns on top of its head that point upwards. The symbol changes position with respect to Earth every 16 hours and 21 minutes. In all recorded cases it has remained within a 5 km radius of the object since first observed. As such, attempts to photograph or film it have been met with failure and adverse effects on equipment used.</p><p>This symbol has been documented to change over time, from one form to another – sometimes very slowly, sometimes rapidly. The following chart displays the current known forms:</p><p>SCP-421 was discovered during a routine lunar orbit survey when a Foundation satellite spotted the object. Upon analysis, SCP-421 was determined to be an artificial artifact created by unknown beings which possessed intelligence greater than human levels on our own planet, though not nearly as great as other entities known on other worlds in our solar system. It was determined that no other lifeform capable of creating an interstellar spacecraft would possess biological technology of similar effectiveness as humans – hence only bipedal organisms could create what we currently know as SCP-421.</p><p>An exploratory mission was dispatched to verify the existence of life on other bodies in our solar system that could produce comparable technologies to SCP-422. Up until this point all expeditions have failed – no lifeforms aside from humans can produce satellites that can orbit around our moon without falling through its gravity well.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
