<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-674</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-674 is to be kept in a humanoid containment cell at Site-19. The object has been observed to appear in various locations around the wing, but is not to be moved from its current location for any reason. Before usage, SCP-674 is to be given a meal consisting of approximately 1 kg of meat and 4 liters of water.</p><p>It is recommended that personnel check the kennels on a daily basis for any evidence of SCP-674 activity. If it is found, either (1) area is to be flooded with a non-flammable liquid; or (2) the area is to be set on fire and extinguished using firefighting equipment. Personnel are to be present when SCP-674 is in use, and avoid direct eye contact with the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-674 is a humanoid entity composed of a human skeleton and muscle tissue. The head, torso, arms and legs are segmented like those of a scorpion. It possesses one functioning arm as well as one functional claw on each hand, although the claws do not function in any way except for basic manipulation. SCP-674 can speak English fluently and appears unable or unwilling to use any other language.</p><p>SCP-674's primary anomalous property manifests whenever it perceives itself to be in imminent danger. Any hostile act toward it by another entity will result in SCP-674 berserking (initially into a state of anger and then into an uncontrollable state of rage) until all threatening elements have been neutralized, or until it is neutralized by the hostile being(s). In this state, SCP-674 is capable of inflicting severe damage to any targets within its reach.</p><p>If restrained or held down, SCP-674 will attempt to break free using its clavicle rather than the joints which are weaker. If the bone breaks, SCP-674 has shown no signs of pain; however, it will continue trying to escape until either its target(s) have been destroyed or it is completely unable to move.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
