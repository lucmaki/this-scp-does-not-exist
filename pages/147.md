<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-147</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-147 is currently kept in a standard petri dish. SCP-147's containment area is to be kept at least ten (10) meters from any public transportation, and any civilians found near the containment area are to be alerted that the object's presence contradicts contemporary scientific theory.</p><p>Any attempts to analyze SCP-147, including [REDACTED], must be approved by level 3 personnel before proceeding. Approval must also be given before using any subject that possesses knowledge of the thaumatropic properties of SCP-147. The object is to be maintained with 5% or less of its original volume filled to prevent dehydration. No outside food or water may be brought into SCP-147's containment area, as this will cause it to replenish itself faster than it can be drained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-147 is a black leather wallet approximately 35cm x 30cm in size. It weighs approximately 70g. In lieu of a normal zip, SCP-147 has a black tab that is the same size as the zipper on the front of the wallet. This tab, when pulled down, causes the object to open immediately; however, it only opens when its owner 'remembers' it opening in this manner from the time of purchase. When opened and closed, SCP-147 appears to be empty.</p><p>SCP-147 displays no apparent anomalous properties until its owner wills it to open. Every time a person wills SCP-147 to open and closes it normally, they are transported to a different point within their lifetime, being transported to the location where they opened SCP-147 for the first time in their life.</p><p>This effect is much stronger if SCP-147 is opened while an individual is experiencing suicidal ideation, especially if the subject is prompted by an aggressive action taken by someone they care about ("You're not worth dying for!"). The more people that open SCP-147 under extreme duress, the longer the effect lasts.</p><p>Example 1: Dr. ██████████ (an employee at ██████ █████) walks into his office after getting home from work, tired and hungry. He places SCP-147 into his coat pocket without opening it, intending to return it later after he gets some rest; he takes his coat off in order to remove his shoes before going inside his apartment building. As he does so, he looks back up at the sky and dies of an apparent heart attack; [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>In reality, Dr. ██████████ died forty hours later due to an unrelated incident at ████████████ ████████ (a local hospital) after complaining of chest pains and trouble breathing at work just before 5pm on ██/██/████. A surviving witness reported hearing Dr. ██████████ repeatedly saying "I'm sorry" while convulsing on the ground outside [DATA EXPUNGED] wearing a suit identical to his current one despite having gotten home barely two hours earlier.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
