<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-733</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-733 is currently held in a standard containment locker, under guard by five (5) security personnel. No personnel are allowed to remove SCP-733 from its containment area without explicit approval from at least one senior member of the SCP-733 team.</p><p>SCP-733 may be used for testing purposes for no longer than 15 days at a time, with a written review by the current project leader before renewal. All materials related to the testing of SCP-733 require approval by the project leader and documentation of their use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-733 is a set of blindingly bright red sunglasses. SCP-733 does not appear to have any sort of camera built into it, as no recording has been found. SCP-733 does not record any images, and does not appear to be equipped to do so in any way. SCP-733's only function seems to be the delivery of small amounts of solar energy from an unknown source.</p><p>SCP-733 is capable of emitting this energy at a rate comparable to that of a typical pair of sunglasses, although with the brightness of the lenses being about 10 times what would be expected for a standard pair of sunglasses. In addition, SCP-733 can beam solar energy directly into the eye of whoever wears them, which is then absorbed and converted into electricity, providing night vision equivalent to that provided by Class 3 Night Vision Goggles unless otherwise noted. This effect remains constant with no deviation that is recorded.</p><p>When using SCP-733's abilities, one will notice they are unable to use basic hand motions normally used while wearing regular glasses; such as looking down at one's watch or making gestures like one would do when wearing a pair of shades.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
