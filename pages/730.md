<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-730</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-730 is to be contained in a watertight, triple-layer titanium sphere, resting at an angle of 80 degrees. This sphere is to remain on the ocean floor. SCP-730's exterior must be monitored at all times.</p><p>In the case of a breach of containment, SCP-730 is to be destroyed by means of a shock wave detonation produced at a depth of over 6 kilometers. The appropriate level of redundancy to prevent this has been incorporated into SCP-730's containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-730 is a space whale, sentient and sapient. It was retrieved from the Atlantic Ocean in 2001 after a series of unusual migrations along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The whale's mass is currently estimated to be over 2.5 million metric tons, making it the heaviest living animal with known DNA [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-730 appears to have grown over 5 meters since being first noticed.</p><p>SCP-730 is able to move through water at an extremely slow pace, but is capable of travelling at speeds approaching that of light. SCP-730's skin is composed entirely of a non-biological organic polymer which it seems to be able to generate autonomously, stripping off and replacing damaged sections with new ones at a rate of approximately 10cm per second. This has led some researchers to believe that SCP-730 may be made up entirely of this material, but this theory has been proven wrong.</p><p>SCP-730 possesses multiple forms and behaviors which vary naturally over time, but can be divided into four basic types; 'Defense Mode', 'Attacks', 'Hunting', and 'Recover/Dispersal'. All efforts should be made to try to remove SCP-730 from this mode as quickly as possible.</p><p>Defense Mode: In Defense Mode, SCP-830 will protect itself by covering its body in a layer of the non-organic polymer which makes up its exterior skin. This polymer eventuates from an unknown internal source and is not replaced during this process. SCP-730 requires very little energy while in Defense Mode; even simple movement can cause it severe pain and discomfort.</p><p>Attacks: In Attacks Mode, SCP-830 will attempt to attack any entity (often human) within range by attempting to strike or slap them with its blubbery hands. These attempts typically target the most vulnerable portions of the victim's body; often on the head or face areas, but no hard rule has been established for this behavior. These attacks typically require significant force (upwards of 3 tons of pressure) but appear to do no long term damage besides causing bruising and swelling. Victims are usually freed of these phenomena after contact with SCP-730 ends, although persistent injury can occur if contact between user and subject is maintained for more than 5 minutes.</p><p>Hunting: In Hunting Mode, SCP-830 will take actions similar to those displayed in attacks mode when near prey; however, these actions generally occur more fluidly and quickly than during Attacking Mode. Typically victims are observed swimming towards their attacker rather than attempting escape from it. Victims caught in this mode initially appear hesitant and in some cases would simply swim away if given time; however most victims have been reported to either be unwilling or unaware of their surroundings for the duration of their time affected by the hunting state; animals afflicted in this manner are commonly found dragging themselves along shorelines or just lying around immobile or unconscious.</p><p>Recovery/Dispersal: In Recovery/Dispersal Mode, SCP-830 will tend to pursue objects emitting bright light such as flares or projectors attached to aircraft (but not satellites). Despite its size and mass, SCP-830 has demonstrated an ability to return quickly towards Earth once it has been released from one such object (such as the ISS when retrieved on ██/██/02). It has also demonstrated an uncanny ability not only to return towards Earth but also navigate space within several hundred kilometers in order to rejoin its mother body [DATA EXPUNGED]. The reason for this behavior is unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
