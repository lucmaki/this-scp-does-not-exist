<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-115</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-115 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. Viewing of SCP-115 is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher. Description and usage of SCP-115 is restricted to researchers with clearance 4/120.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-115 is an 18 cm x 28 cm wooden box consisting of three compartments, each containing a piece of paper with an inscription. SCP-115 was recovered from the home of John ██████ (deceased) in ████ and confiscated by the Foundation after his death.</p><p>If one attempts to open SCP-115, they will hear a "beating heart" (see Addendum 115-1). Attempting to open SCP-115 causes the object to rotate on its axis and thereby forcing it to close. According to Mr. ██████, this noise is generated when SCP-115's hinges are forcibly made contact with one another. When SCP-115 has closed, the sound ceases.</p><p>Opening SCP-115 while closed causes the object to rotate counterclockwise and make a "thumping" noise along with what appears to be blood rivulets along the sides of the box. When the lid opens fully, researchers are greeted by a large amount of blood and what appears to be fused organs.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
