<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-519</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-519 is to be contained in a standardized containment cell at Site-██. Standard humanoid environmental systems are to be maintained within SCP-519's containment cell, with SCP-519's effects disabled before entering it. SCP-519 is to be fed a diet consisting of organic grains and seeds upon entering containment. Any other expenses or requirements needed for its containment are to be paid for by the Foundation out of general budget expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-519 is a humanoid, non-anomalous entity. Apart from its anomalous properties, SCP-519 appears to be healthy and physically well-developed for a human between the ages of 25 and 35.</p><p>SCP-519 will organize its clothing into two separate layers: a top layer and an inner layer. The top layer will include jackets, shirts, pants, and other material that would be considered suitable outerwear. The inner layer will consist of various rags or other materials necessary to maintain the smoothness of SCP-519's skin. These layers can be rearranged at any time.</p><p>The outer layer of SCP-519's body has a lifespan before succumbing to deterioration similar to that of tissue cultured stem cells. Due to this, SCP-519 has no limit to the number of times it can change its clothing, as long as its skin remains viable. It appears that SCP-519 does not have any limitations on the amount of clothing it can remove; however, removing more than what would completely cover its body tends to cause some discomfort for SCP-519 if it attempts to do so. When changed into new clothing, SCP-519 will typically discard anything over a few decades old or ill fitting into its wardrobe.</p><p>SCP-519 displays behavior consistent with that of an emotional masochist as detailed in Interview 519/I:</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ████</p><p>Interviewee: SCP-519</p><p>Dr. ████: Let's start by getting you comfortable with physical contact. How about a hug?</p><p>SCP-519: No thank you; I prefer my arms free to move at all times.</p><p>Dr. ████: Alright then…you aren't going to like this question, but I have to ask it anyway…Why do you enjoy pain so much?</p><p>SCP-519: It isn't always pain, I don't mind.[…] I know what I am feeling; I have felt pleasure before also. [pause] In fact, after experiencing pain so many times in one day…it feels good and rewarding when they give up too early and die on me. It is kind of like getting paid for being strong!</p><p>Dr. ████: You are a sadistic monster.*</p><p>SCP-519: Wait! That was just a joke! Just kidding! I'm joking! Just kidding uh? Shit…wha—ahem…[laughter] Okay fine then…I guess I'm kind of a sadist when it comes down to it. Don't judge me![laughter]</p><p>*Note: During this interview, Dr. ████ had been instructed by his superiors not to directly communicate negative emotional states or experiences with SCP-519 unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
