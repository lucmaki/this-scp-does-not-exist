<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-747</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-747 is to be stored in a secure locker at Site-19's Research Wing. Only currently employed research staff may enter the area containing SCP-747. Any personnel entering the area are to be monitored for the appearance of any un-anomalous movement.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-747 is an iron key approximately 6 cm in length. Research has shown that it does not contain any anomalous properties on its own; however, when placed into a lock, SCP-747 has the same effect as a level-3 Keter-class anomaly.</p><p>Currently, there are no known instances of SCP-747 outside of Foundation custody. All attempts to find the "source" or origin of SCP-747 have been unsuccessful.</p><p>When inserted into a lock and turned, the key materializes at an unknown location inside the building. The object is capable of reaching any building regardless as to whether it has been previously explored or not. The object disappears after thirty minutes (with a maximum of two hours) if none of the individuals present in the building attempted to use it.</p><p>Several tests have been conducted, but none have been able to provide evidence as to what causes SCP-747's anomalous properties.</p><p>Note: A more detailed description of SCP-747's properties can be found [here].</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
