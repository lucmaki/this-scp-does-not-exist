<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-11</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-11 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-28. No personnel are to come within 50 cm of the object. SCP-11's anomalous properties will activate if anyone has more than 5 non-SCP objects in their possession, excluding SCP-11 itself.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-11 is a large (approximately 3 m in height) stone head. SCP-11's anomalous properties activate when more than five unrelated objects are in contact with it simultaneously. Once activated, SCP-11 will animate itself, and start floating towards the closest instance of each object it recognizes as an entity.</p><p>After reaching the entity being targeted, SCP-11 will proceed to remove portions of its body until only a core remains. SCP-11 will then animate this core into a human form and attempt to speak in Chinese. The resulting entity will be completely fluent in Chinese and English, and possess all of the personality traits of a regular Chinese person.</p><p>Upon further examination, SCP-11 was determined to be composed of several previously unknown materials, including:</p><p>SCP-11 has shown no signs of mobility or illness. Furthermore, all previously observed instances of SCP-11 have been heavily deteriorated, and show signs that SCP-11 was transferred/exchanged multiple times for different materials between points of origin and recovery.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
