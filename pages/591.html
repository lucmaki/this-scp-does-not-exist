<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-591</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-591 is to be kept in a sealed and guarded acid tank of 1.3 m deep, at least 10 cm thick, in Site-19. Access to SCP-591 is restricted to personnel with Level-4 security clearance. Any unauthorized attempts by individuals to enter the containment chamber are to be met with lethal force; failure to comply constitutes grounds for D-Class termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-591 is an extradimensional space, which has been designated SCP-591-2. SCP-591-2 is shaped like a Wardrobe, 5m x 1.8m x 5m, with two female humanoid entities visible inside. Due to the extremely small size of this "room," it is highly unlikely that the persons within are not perceiving the external portion directly; additionally, the entity referred to as "King Hearst" appears to be wearing a crown and holding a scepter.</p><p>SCP-591's effects manifest when any living thing attempts to enter SCP-591-2, or enters there spontaneously (currently, all testing requires prior approval by O █).</p><p>When any living thing enters SCP-591-2, it will be found in some sort of disarray. There will always be furniture and clothing scattered on the floor of the wardrobe, along with other items such as books, dishes, and knives. The most prominent of these latter items will typically be a sword or other weapon containing the symbol of Hearst Castle.</p><p>The entities inside SCP-591 will be unusually cheerful and affectionate to anyone who enters and what they are doing when their new friend exits them can vary wildly from instance to instance. It is believed that this effect is related to the image of Hearst Castle which resides inside many places associated with King Hearst, such as in his private train car after his murder or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco where he was assassinated by anarchist Leon Czolgosz.</p><p>If someone reenters SCP-591 after having exited it for more than five minutes, they will find themselves returned to whatever location they previously occupied upon exiting SCP-591.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
