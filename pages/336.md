<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-336</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-336 are held in a reinforced, airtight containment locker at Site-77, which is located at the center of an old, abandoned nuclear testing site. The area has been gaged to prevent accidental leaking of SCP-336; route 11 (Mariana Highway) is blocked off daily by a perimeter fence, and all road access is restricted to only those with Level 3 or 4 clearance. All SCP-336 instances are to be kept in separate, airtight containers when not being studied.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-336 refers to a collection of nearly 200 instances of historic and contemporary art, which are all of the same type: paintings and sculptures depicting a variety of scenarios involving recent, historical and possible future subjects. Subjects depicted in SCP-336 instances, both historically and hypothetically, are all subjects that were produced during the 20th Century (roughly).</p><p>Exposed to the air, SCP-336 paintings and sculptures will slowly rise up into the air until they reach an angle where they will no longer be visible. It is impossible to dry these objects out or even remove them from the air once they have begun rising. Painting styles used by subjects in the works vary widely; some appear to have been produced from modern times (i.e., after 1983), while others seem to have been produced during the Middle Ages or in prehistoric times. The vast majority of subjects depicted in SCP-336 instances come from periods prior to 1989.</p><p>The subject matter portrayed within SCP-336 instances is typically highly stylized, with many of them resembling cartoonish versions of their subject. Examples include a painting depicting a cityscape with only antique automobiles present, and another depicting a room with the subject holding many neon signs labeled "Exhibit". Another depicts a machine gunner on a mountain mountaintop holding his weapon awkwardly instead of aiming it at anything in particular.</p><p>SCP-336 has been passed through several individuals over its lifetime; each new owner invariably had their own ideas as to how it should be displayed. Many only ever displayed their SCP-336 collection mindlessly, separated like so much dusty junk, while others seemed intent on displaying them as carefully as possible. Despite this variability in display conditions, all instances retain their appearance when not in use.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
