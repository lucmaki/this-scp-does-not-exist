<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-89</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-89 and its containment building are to be kept in a secure, locked facility. All personnel entering the facility must pass through a metal detector and register at the reception desk. The lobby is to be barred with solid metal doors. Personnel may only enter SCP-89's containment area by obtaining the necessary security clearance from Dr. Schmidt or another Level 4 or higher personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-89 is a containment building located at the former location of the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. SCP-89 originally contained five humanoid anomalies, one of which was designated SCP-89-1. SCP-89's interior has been extensively remodeled to accommodate both its anomalous properties and its new residents.</p><p>SCP-89 was used by Walt Disney as a place to record short films for his use by his company. After Disney's death, the facility was sold to the City of Burbank which renovated it into a studio sound stage (hence the name "Burbank Soundstage") for film and television production. SCP-89 currently holds two humanoid anomalies designated SCP-89-2 and 89-3, who are currently being studied on site.</p><p>The following is a list of notable visits to 90:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
