<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-206</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-206 is contained in a standard Safe containment unit. SCP-206 is to be kept in a 15×3×10 m laboratory locker. Testing of SCP-206 is to be performed using approved testing procedures described in TESTING SPECIFICATIONS document. Testing may only be conducted by Level 3 or higher personnel. All testing is governed by the following policies:</p><p>Testing in which SCP-206 will not test positive for the presence of the anomalous properties contained within it is prohibited, as is testing that will cause loss of life or property.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-206 is a cylindrical object with a height of 1 m and a width of 9 cm. SCP-206 emits a series of loud, intermittent tones that appear to originate from its interior. The tones are of varying frequencies, but generally range between 2000 and 4000 Hertz. Any subject hearing the tones will experience negative effects on their senses of hearing and balance leading up to and during testing.</p><p>During experimentation, it is strongly recommended that subjects wear headphones or earplugs while the experiment is ongoing.</p><p>When the tone volume reaches a certain value, the tone frequencies increase in speed and volume. The rate at which the frequencies increase increases exponentially until all possible frequencies have been reached. At this point, moving objects within the sound field begin to break down, irrespective of whether or not they are being observed by anyone. This phenomenon is known as SCP-206's "Emanation Wave."</p><p>Infrared testing proved inconclusive in predicting when testing will take place; however, visual observation has proven to be accurate in determining that the Emanation Wave occurs in roughly fifteen minutes time. In laboratory testing, no instance of non-anomalous dissolution has occurred until all testees have been affected by the Emanation Wave regardless of how long it may take for an instance of non-anomalous dissolution to occur (See Test Log 206-1). The rate of occurrence and intensity of this effect appears to depend on both the sensitivity of the subjects' hearing and eyesight as well as their proximity to SCP-206 during testing. Subjects in remote locations from SCP-206 often face delays of up to twenty minutes before experiencing any symptoms and are often unaware of an Emanation Wave even occurring if one were taking place.</p><p>Males seem to have a much greater response time than females when exposed to SCP-206's Emanation Wave; however, there do not appear to be any statistical patterns associated with this response time variance between women. In addition, male testees show less sensitivity than female testees in regards to SCP-206's Emanation Wave. While 100% of subjects exposed only through sound will be affected by the actual expansion of its field, subjects who are actually exposed to SCP-206's field itself will suffer no deleterious effects.</p><p>Procedure 206-1: Testing for properties related to non-anomalous phenomena began in ██/██/196█ with Drs R███████ and O█████ after creating sufficient background material on SCP-████ (now [REDACTED]), and observing it perform anomalous disappearances several times over several months during tests that concentrated on visual observation alone with minimal auditory involvement. Testing was conducted using a specially constructed chamber with room temperature maintained between 19°C and 38°C during tests that lasted between 4 hours and 3 days (see Test Log 206) at a range equivalent to [REDACTED]'s maximum possible range via auditory means (but still consistent with infrared transmission). Sensory deprivation measures were undertaken at the discretion of Ds R███████ and O█████ on all testees involved in neurological experiments involving SCP-████ or SCP-207 prior to being allowed into room 205, as well as upon entry into room 205 if done so after sensory deprivation measures had already begun (see Test Log 206-2). All procedures were overseen by either Ds D█████ or W█████. Once this initial testing was concluded without incident it was decided that further study would focus on additional anomalous properties related solely or mostly - via auditory transmission - with no visual perception required or assumed (testing involving both visual perception and auditory transmission is prohibited due to potential containment breaches).</p><p>The following rules were unanimously agreed upon by all members involved with this project:</p><p>Procedure 206-1a: Expanded testing criteria have been approved accordingly; however note that existing test logs should not be amended unless evidence is found that supports changing these conditions.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
