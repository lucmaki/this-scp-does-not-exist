<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-554</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-554 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment locker at Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-554 is a motion-sensing video game console bearing the markings "Taito Enterprises, Ltd." located in New York City.</p><p>SCP-554 is capable of producing a non-anomalous console warp effect when a disc is inserted into its slot. Inserting a disc into SCP-554 causes its internal software to automatically boot up and render a completely non-anomalous graphical background on its primary display.</p><p>SCP-554 is currently programmed to run the same version of █████ █████████'s sci-fi shooter game "Avatar".</p><p>The player controls the Avatar, an extraterrestrial humanoid armed with lasers, weaponry and an assault rifle (all of which are selectable by the player). The Avatar can be equipped with multiple weapons and accessories, including [REDACTED] which possess no anomalous properties.</p><p>Throughout gameplay, SCP-554 will occasionally display augmented reality imagery projected through special projection screens located within the console's holographic projectors. The imagery consists of static images depicting various locations within the game world, as well as brief animations portraying battle sequences and dialogue exchanges between non-anomalous entities.</p><p>When a disc is inserted into SCP-554 and boots up to its first level, the background will change from its pre-set graphical depiction to an image of [REDACTED], presumably a human female (See Addendum 554-1). However, at this time the background image is rendered in shades of red and appears distorted with markings resembling bloodstains. The female avatar then disappears into thin air moments before the background begins to undergo significant alterations; these changes rapidly reduce the size of the image until it becomes indistinguishable from one produced by a human subject viewing this region of space through advanced technology.</p><p>Immediately following this sudden appearance of [REDACTED], an explosion will occur in front of the screen; this explosion will only occur if that area of space has been previously viewed by a human subject during gameplay. After approximately [REDACTED] after gameplay has ceased, several entities resembling humanoid avatars will appear out of nowhere (See Addendum 554-2 for details) and engage the discarded weapon(s) possessed by the avatar; this process continues until all ammunition has been depleted or upon reaching either scenario described above (see Addendum 554-3 for details). During combat scenarios involving multiple enemies, ammunition cannot be replenished until combat ceases.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
