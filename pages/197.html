<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-197</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-197 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. SCP-197 has shown no signs of suicidal tendencies, and should be given an adequate diet consisting of plant matter, animal products, and yeast. No water may enter the cell; any that does so is to be discarded.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-197 is a male humanoid, with the physical appearance and general behavioral patterns of human males. It is approximately 2 cm in height and weighs approximately 1 kg. SCP-197 is mute and will not speak, though it is capable of vocalizations (see Addendum 197-1).</p><p>SCP-197 is able to manipulate money, coins, jewelry and other assorted valuables with abilities similar to those of a standard magician. When presented with valuables, it will "magically" perform slight modifications (such as making the item appear to weigh less or heavier) and then perform small rituals over the object while chanting incantations.</p><p>When presented with a large amount of money (including currency from a variety of nationalities), SCP-197 will attempt to double its current holdings; if successful, it will lose the ability to function normally until it has gained all of the money back. SCP-197 will then repeat these actions indefinitely; however, any increase in wealth does not allow it to gain more wealth than what was paid at the time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
