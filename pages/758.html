<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-758</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-758 is to be kept in a locked locker at Site ██. SCP-758 is not to be removed from the locker unless it is being tested or repaired.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-758 is a small, light-weight silver-colored lamp that has been in use for over 200 years under the name “The Empire Lamp”. SCP-758 has several features that have not changed since its initial production, including the fact that it uses extremely little power and can be used indefinitely.</p><p>The main feature of SCP-758 is that it activates when an individual uses more than 1 liter of water per day to bathe or wash their hands. For example, if an individual used 2 liters of water in a day, SCP-758 would activate. If the person washes their hands (clothing, hair, or body) with 1 liter of water or less, SCP-758 will remain inactive until they increase their daily water usage.</p><p>When activated by the use of water, SCP-758 will display several messages describing how the individual currently bathes or showers and what kind of soap is being used. These messages are shown at approximately 1 minute intervals and usually begin with the phrase “You feel refreshed now.”</p><p>After approximately 20 seconds, SCP-758 will then activate its secondary function as well. This function consists of several flashing lights that blink every second from top to bottom on the front half of SCP-758. All messages made during this time are accompanied by these flashing lights and are transmitted at random intervals. The messages range from simple directions to complex instructions involving complex mathematics problems.</p><p>After 30 minutes have passed, the operation of the flashing lights will cease and the lamp will once again revert to its original activation state.</p><p>If an individual is able to complete one or more of these problems successfully, they will gain control over SCP-758 and can use it as they see fit. Any attempts at using it in any way other than an attempt to solve mathematical problems immediately results in loss of control over SCP-758 and immediate activation of its secondary function as described above. It is currently unknown whether or not additional calculations beyond basic arithmetic are required to use SCP-758 successfully.</p><p>SCP-758 was contained by Foundation agents who infiltrated a religious group known as “The Apostolic Order of Saint Peter’s Church” on June ██, 1963. The agents were successful in recovering all 21 members of the Order and successfully contained them after a short investigation into the church's activities and documents was performed. All members have confirmed that SCP-758 is part of their holy relics and are willing to cooperate fully with Foundation researchers in order to maintain their belief in the object's powers.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
