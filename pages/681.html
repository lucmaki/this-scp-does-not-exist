<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-681</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-681 is to be kept in a cage large enough for it to move around freely. The tank's floor is to be lined with tarpaulin, and the only objects in the room other than SCP-681 are a fish tank heater and a large container filled with aquarium water.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-681 is a species of fish, though the specimen appears to have died in the wild. Its coloration is unusual, and its scales are abnormally colored and patterned. Its body structure is like that of a typical freshwater fish, but it exhibits a few distinct characteristics (see Addendum 681-a).</p><p>SCP-681 displays an abnormal level of intelligence. It can use tools, such as fishing lines and hooks, to navigate and manipulate its environment. It is capable of holding concepts such as "fishing pole", "hook" and "fishing lure". It shows a remarkable understanding of humans, having been observed to recognize individual people, although SCP-681's response to human behavior has only ever been amused at the very most. It does not appear to attempt communication with humans, or even acknowledge them as beings of equal intellect.</p><p>SCP-681 will exhibit several behaviors that indicate it understands the concept of death. When quickly caught, it will not fight back or try to escape. Instead, it will act calmly and wait for its imprisonment to end. SCP-681 has never shown any signs of distress when handled or examined by non-Foundation personnel. After being released from captivity, SCP-681 will immediately try to return home, ignoring attempts to stop it from leaving. Upon arrival at its home tank, SCP-680 will swim back into its cave after 9 hours without using any tools or body parts in order to unclog the entrance with their mouths.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
