<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-815</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-815 is to be kept in a storage locker at Site-██. All experiments with SCP-815 are permitted under the supervision of level 4 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-815 is a small spiral notebook, completely devoted to the study of human psychology. The front cover reads, "The Complete Manual on Human Psychology. Revised and Updated Edition."</p><p>All samples within SCP-815 were written in by the original author, Dr. ██████, who has been missing since his disappearance during experimentation with SCP-███ in 1974.</p><p>SCP-815 possesses no anomalous properties before being opened, as it is quite ordinary literature in every aspect. It was discovered by ████ ████, an agent in the ███████████ agency.</p><p>Subjects that read or write in SCP-815 for at least twenty minutes experience a form of amnesia related to their own personality. For instance, subjects who write about themselves will begin writing about other characters, rather than themselves. Subjects who read about themselves will begin writing from the point of view of another character, usually a neutral one. Subjects who read about a neutral character will begin writing about a character they are familiar with; subjects who read about a familiar character will begin writing about a subject near and dear to them; subjects who read about themselves will shift their focus to another character entirely. All subjects have reported that they feel just as confident in their new writing style as they would if they had been writing it all along.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
