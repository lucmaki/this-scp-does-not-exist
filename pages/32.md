<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-32</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-32 is to be contained in a specially constructed safe, located in Site ██. The room housing SCP-32 has been constructed to minimize damage from any breach of containment. No fewer than six (6) security personnel are to be within the room at all times to prevent unauthorized access. Only two (2) researchers are permitted within the room at any one time.</p><p>Access to SCP-32 requires written authorization by a member of level 4 or higher in the Site security hierarchy, and must be restricted to testing only. Equipment necessary for testing may be removed from the room without permission, but must be returned before resuming testing. Administering amnestics to test subjects is permissible if deemed necessary by supervisors.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-32 is a large, spherical container, constructed of a durable plastic material and measuring approximately 1 meter in diameter. A hose to pump a liquid through the interior is connected to an input port located on the top of the sphere. The interior contains three (3) mechanisms of unknown origin, which when manipulated in some way produce a flavored liquid.</p><p>The liquid produced by SCP-32 has a consistent taste and odor that researchers have determined to be similar to that of caramels.</p><p>SCP-32 was recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED] in ██████ County, Missouri, after a report of two men leaving the scene by fast vehicle was received. Foundation agents were sent in as backup and contacted local authorities for assistance. The bodies of one man and one woman were discovered nearby, both manifesting no unusual injuries or effects from being submerged in the liquid produced by SCP-32. Their identification was confirmed by dental records. Investigation has revealed that both individuals were former customers of the establishment where SCP-32 was recovered. The bodies were then returned to their families for burial.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
