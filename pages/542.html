<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-542</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-542 is to be kept in a custom containment locker at Site-74, a facility located in Northern California with access to low humidity and minimal light conditions. The safety of Site-74 personnel is to be maintained at all times, and termination of life threatening situations is to be handled by onsite security personnel. Any personnel leaving SCP-542's containment should come equipped with waterproof shoes, car guards, and life jackets.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-542 is an analog wristwatch with a digital display identical to the ██████ model, produced in 2000. The object is handmade and coated with a mineral oil that makes it waterproof, but not chemically resistant. Water contacting the object will make the digits on the digital display go blank until evaporated away by heat generated by human interaction.</p><p>SCP-542's anomalous effects are activated when the user engages in a state of conscious rest known as sleep paralysis. Upon activating SCP-542, a person will appear to be floating above their bed, where they will watch themselves sleeping for about 5 minutes before falling asleep (see video #1). When activated, SCP-542 appears to retain some ability to sense its surroundings; it will occasionally move about and touch objects nearby as if searching for something. Video documentation shows that testing personnel do not experience any discomfort from this sequence.</p><p>Upon waking up from sleep paralysis, SCP-542's anomalous effects will last at least half an hour before ceasing to function. Throughout this time, the user may be able to see other people and pets close by through their bedroom ceiling or windows (see video #2). Upon attempting to exit the room, or when leaving Site-74, SCP-542's anomalous effects will cease to function, with users recovering consciousness in their beds. If a person is discovered utilizing SCP-542 after being trapped inside their residence by SCP-542's anomalous effects for more than an hour, Foundation authorities should be notified immediately.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
