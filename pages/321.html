<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-321</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-321 is held in a Safe SCP object locker at Site 15. Testing on SCP-321 must be authorized by the site director, and researchers must be vaccinated against SCP-321 prior to testing. Requesting a C-class clearance for testing is discouraged; testing with a lower clearance level may still result in permanent damage.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-321 is an analogue to “Discovery”, the Bachelor variant. When activated, SCP-321 will, for the next seven days, issue a set of instructions to any humans testing it. The instructions must be followed exactly as written for it to work. Personnel who do not follow these instructions exactly will note that the instructions were not carried out properly, and report this to their supervisor or the site director immediately. The instructions are printed on two sheets of standard printing paper and are typed with a manual typewriter.</p><p>SCP-321 was recovered during a raid on a Satanic ritual in [REDACTED] by Foundation agents with clearance Level 3/321. Investigations prior to this date had proven fruitless, due to the fact that SCP-321 appears only in public areas.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
