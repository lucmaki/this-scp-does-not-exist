<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-422</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A single Foundation Task Force (TF) is to be stationed at the site of SCP-422. All team members are expected to be proficient with firearms, explosives, and first aid. Guards are to provide security for SCP-422 and prevent unauthorized access.</p><p>Any person entering within a range of 70m from SCP-422 is to be considered as having been affected by SCP-422. These affected persons must then proceed directly to their nearest Foundation medical center, or be administered an injection of epinephrine at the first opportunity. Any personnel coming into contact with SCP-422 are to be immediately removed from its vicinity, as are all stray animals drawn to it (see Incident Log 422).</p><p>The remaining components of SCP-422 may be used for experimental purposes by researchers assigned to SCP-422 and authorized by the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-422 is a facility located in ██████, Japan. It consists of a large warehouse containing dozens of rooms, many of which contain foodstuffs, most of which appear to be edible. The warehouse appears to have been converted for SCP use, as it contains numerous hooks and shelves on the walls, presumably for clothing or other items.</p><p>Said persons affected by SCP-422 will move towards any food source within a range of 70m from SCP-422. Said food will be eaten by said individuals randomly, usually a maximum of two servings, at random intervals. Affected persons are not able to recognize whether the food is edible or not (see Incident Log 422). Attempts to determine its nutritional content have thus far failed.</p><p>SCP-422 has also been known to affect cats, apparently due to its association with former research projects involving genetically altered cats. Said cats are found in SCP-422's vicinity nearly exclusively at night and are typically confused and disoriented when discovered. Two deceased cats were recovered from the vicinity after being observed by an individual affected by SCP-422.</p><p>No person affected by SCP-422 has reported feeling ill after eating the food found within its proximity. Persons affected by SCP-422 will attempt to provide their own sustenance to themselves if absent from said location for more than one week.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
