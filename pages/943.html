<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-943</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-943 is kept in a standard containment locker at Site-43. Any requests for images or footage of SCP-943 are to be sent through the proper channels.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-943 is a US Air Force F-16 Fighter Jet, which has been modified to resemble an Ancient Assyrian winged bull statuette from around 2300 BCE. The plane's paint scheme has been altered to resemble the winged bull; the plane's side has been painted with miniature scale miniatures of the animal. A religious symbol is painted on each wing, whose alignment matches that of the sun. An inscription in cuneiform, matching the same language used in early Mesopotamian carvings, covers the plane's body and can be seen when it is removed.</p><p>In air-to-air combat, SCP-943 has displayed capabilities that far surpass those of any other single-seat fighter jet in US military service. For example:</p><p>SCP-943 will travel to any destination whenever commanded by one of its pilots (both active duty and retired). SCP-943 does not require replenishment with fuel or ammunition, despite being armed for combat. In fact, its pilots have no control over the plane whatsoever — it will only stop following its pilot on command.</p><p>When engaged by an enemy plane, SCP-943 will isolate its target— usually a pilot— and disorient them via anomalous means, before then destroying its target in tandem with said pilot. SCP-943 possesses a high degree of intelligence, and will follow certain flight patterns to maximize damage against specific targets.</p><p>The standard cockpit plaque appears to indicate that both pilots were killed in flight testing prior to the introduction into service; however, both remain alive within the plane itself at all times. Both pilots are reincarnated into new planes after death each time their planes are destroyed; however, their names remain unchanged between lives.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
