<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-74</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-74 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with no more than forty (40) grams of metal inside. SCP-74 is not to be handled without gloves, as it transmits its effects through close contact.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-74 is a "box" about the size and shape of a German medium hard-waxed sweet chocolate bar, with a fractal dimension of approximately 55. SCP-74 is found to contain no anomalous properties before being introduced to metal; its metallic component is not to be removed from SCP-74 until after the removal of their components.</p><p>When an individual eats or handles SCP-74, they will experience a small number of cognitive abnormalities. The first is that a small number of unexpected events may occur, even if no anomalous objects are present in the area. The second is that an object or person (particularly an inanimate object) will take on characteristics of SCP-74's metallic component; additional exceptions have been noted where this occurs while the object or person is already metallic. When an anomaly occurs, it is not limited to objects but also include people: a person who has been identified as a metahuman member of the humanoid race will spontaneously become metallic when within ten (10) minutes of SCP-74.</p><p>SCP-74 was discovered in ████████████ after reports of spontaneous transmutation among homeless populations were reported by Foundation assets across ████████, ████ and █████. The object was confiscated by Mobile Task Force Gamma-7 ("The Snatchers") and moved to [REDACTED]. SCP-74 was placed under Level 3 containment at Site-12 after discovery and classification as Euclid, pending further study on how it produces anomalous effects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
