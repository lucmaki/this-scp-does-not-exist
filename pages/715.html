<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-715</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Regular searches of the area are to be conducted by Foundation Agent Gregory.</p><p>Following Incident 715-A, all oil refineries within a 300 km radius of SCP-715 have been to be razed, and all oil pipelines within a 200km radius have been fully decommissioned. A series of armed patrols have been placed near SCP-715 for the purpose of preventing civilian access, as well as monitoring for anomalies related to SCP-715.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-715 is an anomalous phenomenon located in the southwestern portion of the San Joaquin Valley, California. SCP-715 does not have a fixed location, but has been recorded to appear at various locations, including ██████, [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>SCP-715 is primarily a blue powder that resembles airborne pollen. When inhaled through the nose, SCP-715 will cause mild euphoria to those within three hundred meters of it, as well as a slight increase in physical strength. Emotional damage seems to be significantly muted by exposure to SCP-715.</p><p>SCP-715 was first observed on ██/██/1972, when a sample was found on the roof of ██████ Gas and Oil Company's (███) Oil Refinery in Maricopa County, Arizona. The Foundation managed to prevent any civilian casualties from the initial site of exposure.</p><p>Shortly after the initial discovery of SCP-715, blood samples were taken from ██ individuals in southern California. The purpose of these samples was not discovered until later; however, due to a lack of immediate risk during this period, these samples were never administered to other members of humanity.</p><p>On ██/██/1973, an incident involving one member of SCP-███ took place in the town of ██████, California. An individual there claimed that he had ingested SCP-715 and that he had gained telekinetic powers due to it. This individual was later interviewed by Dr. █████ and showed no signs of enhancement beyond what already occurred from consuming SCP-715 prior to starting his experiments with it. This individual's report allowed for the testing of SCP-715's effects on humans for further study.</p><p>Two months later, on ██/██/1973 in ██████, California, 11 individuals began displaying similar abilities (namely being able to levitate small objects). These individuals were identified as SCP-715 victims; however all 11 distinct increases in power had an uncommon origin: most mutations occurred when a victim attempted to demonstrate their powers for others for the first time. Some victims utilized their newfound abilities in more violent manners; this resulted in Drs. █████ and █████ trying to find out how and why these changes occurred several weeks later on ██/██/1973.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
