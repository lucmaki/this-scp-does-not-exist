<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-59</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-59 is held under the care of the Foundation's 2nd Containment Unit. The Unit's current base of operations is in Palisades, NY on private land owned by the Foundation. The Unit's current staff consists of two (2) Level 3 personnel and two (2) D-class personnel. The entirety of Palisades is considered to be a site-19 external operation zone.</p><p>SCP-59 is located in a sealed containment locker at Site 19. Access to the locker is restricted to personnel with Level 2 clearance. Only one cell phone is allowed at a time inside SCP-59's containment room.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-59 is a cylindrical tube, approximately two centimeters in diameter and ten centimeters long. The tube is made of clear glas with no markings save for one unique detail; a red dot has been etched around the tube's circumference, which is burned into the glass by lighter fluid. A plastic circular sticker reads "Spirit Acupuncture".</p><p>When exposed to the human body, SCP-59 will begin to radiate a non-electromagnetic field that appears neutral. While active, the aura generated by SCP-59 will have the effect of removing or returning any negative spiritual influence. When used on inanimate objects and entities, SCP-59 displays no anomalous effects.</p><p>SCP-59 was brought to SCP foundation containment following reports of its use by ██████ County sheriffs investigating disappearances and other paranormal occurrences in the area at the time of its recovery. It was discovered in a house's attic through an anonymous tip on ████ following [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
