<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-819</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-819 is to be taken from its current housing in the Humboldt Park Zoo and moved at least once per month. SCP-819 is to be provided with two (2) two-hour periods of free time per day, which are to be spent at its current containment facility. During these periods, SCP-819 is to be allowed to perform various acts of exertion and improvisation before the nearby crowd while under supervision by no fewer than three (3) security personnel. During this time, SCP-819's containment should be monitored via remote location or SCP-819 itself should be immobilized in a non-aesthetic manner to prevent it from injuring bystanders.</p><p>Due to the similarity between SCP-819's practices and those of street performers, agents are currently working on creating a public relations campaign for SCP-819. As a first step, information regarding SCP-819's anomalous properties is classified as a Gammavoir, as opposed to an Euclid/Thaumiel, Keter, or Apollyon threat.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-819 is a male orangutan (Pongo abelii), approximately 2.5 meters in height, weighing approximately 30 kilograms. On the left side of its body, SCP-819 bears an extensive scar tissue as well as several anomalous alterations, including:</p><p>SCP-819 requires no food, water, or rest to sustain itself, and will attempt to perform acts of physical exertion such as climbing over structures and performing acrobatic tricks until such time as it has been physically exhausted. The act of climbing has been observed to cause SCP-819's anomalous tissues to expand and retract at random intervals; this may be the source of SCP-819's regenerative capabilities.</p><p>SCP-819 attempts to learn various forms of artistic performance by observing humans in the vicinity; in addition to attempting these acts itself, it will assist others in perfecting their acts. It is also capable of teaching basic movements to humans. SCP-819 appears to have a limited ability to read human emotion, but is unable to express or fully understand human speech outside of music or other artistic forms; it speaks English in order to communicate with researchers and staff.</p><p>The public response to SCP-819 exhibits a significant degree of variability between audiences. From speaking openly about human emotion via dancing and song, SCP-819 has been known to sing songs from famous musicals and classical works (such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony). In order to avoid damage from audience members, SCP-819 has occasionally used objects found on site during its performances as makeshift drumsticks, pitch pipes, and a megaphone.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
