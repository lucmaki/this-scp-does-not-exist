<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-56</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-56 are to be monitored for development, with the objective of neutralizing it in the event of its manifestation. Instances of SCP-56 should not be physically removed from their mediums.</p><p>Explosives may be used to render instances of SCP-56 inert, as long as a sizable quantity of the blood is preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-56 is a phenomenon that allows any blood, human or otherwise, to be transferred from one medium to another. The blood must be separated into its constituent elements in order for it to be transmitted through SCP-56 (e.g., severed limbs will not transmit if all of the limb is still intact).</p><p>If an instance of SCP-56 is contacted with blood from a different instance of SCP-56, then that new instance of SCP-56 will become active. In this case, the new instance of SCP-56 will grow to maturity within 1–5 days and then begin producing instances of SCP-56 at a rate of 60 per hour.</p><p>SCP-56 was originally discovered after reports surfaced regarding an unusually heavy rainstorm in ████████, Italy. Investigations conducted by local authorities revealed several instances of SCP-56 in the area affected by the storm. After determining that the werewolf's saliva causes these instances of SCP-56 to manifest, the vampire population was located, and containment procedures enacted.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
