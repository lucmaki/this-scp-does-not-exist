<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-233</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-233 is to be kept in Site-79's containment wing and observed under 24x7 video surveillance. In the event of a containment breach, Mobile Task Force Gamma-7 ("Firehouse") is to use standard O Containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-233 is a decommissioned mobile phone tower located in [REDACTED]. SCP-233 was dismantled and transported to Site-79, where it is kept in a standard containment chamber with thick steel doors. The interior of the chamber has been heavily modified in order to house SCP-233 and its contents.</p><p>In the basement of SCP-233's containment chamber is the remains of the Foundation's old motor pool. The motor pool was originally used to prevent the use of SCP-233 as a hidden escape route, but since this area was not regularly checked, it was used as a secondary containment unit for SCP-233. It appears that the construction of the containment chamber was based on a modified blueprint of our own Site ██'s motor pool, which dates back to at least ████.</p><p>Within the motor pool are various anomalous objects which cannot be described due to their value being over ███. They are labeled as SCP-███ (1), SCP-███ (2), and so forth. Each instance of an SCP inside SCP-233 is believed to have been removed from our facilities and brought into Earth orbit shortly before their disappearance. These are all listed below.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
