<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-859</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-859 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell measuring 10 m x 8 m, furnished with a bed and washbasin. All interaction between SCP-859 and third parties is to be strictly monitored via remote cameras.</p><p>Only personnel with at least a month's experience in dealing with SCP-859 are permitted to enter SCP-859's containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-859 is a humanoid (Humanoid 1; SCPs-1-2-3-4) with no external signs of age. SCP-859 possesses a head and upper torso resembling those of an adult male (SCP-859-3). However, its arms and legs are far smaller than those of an adult male.</p><p>The anomalous part of SCP-859's anatomy is the legs, which have either one or three digits on their lower extremities. The number of digits may vary from one to five. Testing has shown that there is no correlation between the number of digits and the age of SCP-859. DNA testing shows that these limbs are artificial in origin, but it cannot be determined whether they are biological or nonbiological in nature.</p><p>SCP-859 claims to be a highly successful Royal Knight and claims to have "conquered" all areas on Earth during its career as a knight. It further states that it was appointed King by the Pope in 571 A.D., although it does not know why it was chosen. It maintains that the award was made on account of its exceptional military prowess, along with the fact that "only a single person had ever been able to defeat [it]".</p><p>Like most members of the species, SCP-859 has an excellent memory and an exceptionally high intellect, equalling those of high school graduates decades older than itself. SCP-859 does not appear to suffer any kind of mental disorder or discontinuity in its thought processes.</p><p>Actual contact with third parties has revealed that SCP-859 speaks nine languages fluently: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Latin, Romanian, Polish, Russian and English.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
