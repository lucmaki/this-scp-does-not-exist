<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-335</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Containment is being maintained at the closest available Foundation site. The facility itself is codenamed "The Well", and has been constructed as a means of containing SCP-335. Amy can be contained by use of a soundproofed containment chamber, and SCP-335 should be contained in a separate cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-335 is a decaying humanoid corpse with a torso, legs and arms present. The forearms are missing, though SCP-335 retains SCP-339 in their place. Several publications list SCP-335 as being male; at the time of its discovery this was incorrect. No other remains have been identified.</p><p>The first time SCP-335's anomaly was observed, it kept repeating the phrase "I've got bad news" over and over again to any individual who observed it. This behavior continued even after the Foundation took control of its containment. The only way to stop this is by killing SCP-335, or removing its anomalous properties permanently via destruction.</p><p>SCP-335 is hostile toward Foundation personnel, regardless of age and gender, and will attempt to attack them on sight. Should SCP-335 be killed, it will reanimate within 48 hours; three full days of dormancy must elapse before it attempts to reanimate again. This process can be sped up with the use of properly treated amnestics .</p><p>Should SCP-335 reach an age in which it will not be able to reanimate due to denaturation, a process that would normally take roughly 35 years, the anomalous properties of SCP-335 will instead activate once every 2.5 years for a period of 5 years. This is currently ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
