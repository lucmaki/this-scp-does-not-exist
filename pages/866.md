<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-866 is a paperback novel entitled The Rapture, by S. T. Joshi. It is dated March 1, 1987 and bears a copyright of Patrick R. Loomis. The front cover shows a humanoid figure holding a fragment of the cover in its hand and resembles that of SCP-████.</p><p>The back cover shows the same figure standing in what appears to be an outdoor garden with lush vegetation, accompanied by the message: "Nor will we fail you." There is also a telephone number printed on the back. In addition, the back cover features a handwritten note from Joshua Hall-Drewn, claiming to be the author of The Rapture.</p><p>The inside of the book features an orange case enclosing an unknown substance and a small card with writing on it. It reads: </p><p>SUBJECT IS DENIED INTREST IN THE MAKING OF THIS BOOK</p><p>FOR ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CONTACT AO RESEARCH</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
