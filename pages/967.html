<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-967</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-967 is to be contained in a remote area of the ███████ National Forest, where it is to be kept from the general public. No civilians are permitted to enter this area. An agent of the Foundation will monitor SCP-967's location and report any evidence of its movement or activity, including any sighting of SCP-967-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-967 is a 15 m tall structure of unknown origin, constructed from wood and metal. SCP-967 does not display any anomalous properties when observed from the outside, however when it is in use for some goal by human subjects, its interior is capable of manifesting anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-967-1 are a group of entities which manifest inside SCP-967, though they appear to be projections of the persons using them. SCP-967-1 will only manifest in the presence of the person who is currently using SCP-967. The entities can remain in an incorporeal state while inside SCP-967 and do not require air to survive.</p><p>The following is a list of known uses of SCP-967:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
