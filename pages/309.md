<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-309</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-309 is to be contained in a standard Safe Class item locker, and kept at all times under guard. As of 23/03/2015, SCP-309 is currently stored at Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-309 is an open book containing handwritten mathematical formulas. Similar to the Elements of Euclid, the text is written in the Euclidean script, which uses pure mathematics as its language.</p><p>The book's cover depicts two people staring at a green flat surface. The characters seen on its cover are not found anywhere in Euclid's Elements, nor do they resemble any known mathematicians or figures from history. For example, the characters "Euclid" and "Archimedes" are not present in SCP-309. No historical figure holding a book similar to SCP-309 has ever been found before or since its acquisition.</p><p>The mathematical formulas within SCP-309 bear close similarities to those found in the Elements of Euclid. The similarity goes beyond just word usage, however, in that nearly all formulas contain the same symbols in different places with the same values.</p><p>Aside from the mathematical content, the text contains several sentences written by an unknown author. Since it was acquired and confiscated by Secret Service in [REDACTED], it has remained unreadable due to severe water damage.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
