<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-660</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-660 is stored in a soundproof, climate-controlled room at Site-██. SCP-660 may be removed from the containment chamber for testing purposes without authorisation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-660 is an ornate, silver-grey teleprompter. Testing has shown that the device can display information to the subject's eyes and speech to the subject's mouth with no noticeable delay. When used in this manner, the object reads words and phrases at a rate of approximately 100 words per minute (WPM).</p><p>SCP-660 displays its function as "Hillary Clinton for President?" on a multi-coloured LCD screen within its casing. The device's control system allows the user to programme speech to be displayed in a variety of languages, including Russian and German. This feature was activated by [DATA EXPUNGED], who exhibited behavioural changes consistent with those seen in former Presidential candidate Senator ██████ ██████ upon first use of SCP-660 . SCP-660's control system also appears to have been programmed to accept credit card data for use on an online fundraising platform.</p><p>When testing SCP-660's ability to display human faces, D-class personnel appear to project their own image; they were not aware of this effect until informed of it by Drs. ████████ and ███████.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
