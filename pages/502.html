<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-502</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Decaying (K</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-502 is to be contained in a 2m x 2m x 5m cryogenic storage unit. Weekly patrols are to inspect for signs of anomalous or living organisms. A scientific team is to check the environmental conditions and assess the state of SCP-502.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-502 is a statue of the apostle Paul, located on the church grounds of the Church of Saint Paul in Otterbein, Ohio. SCP-502 appears to be in an advanced state of decay.</p><p>SCP-502 is hollow, and contains no detectable means of propulsion or power generation. The inside walls are crudely scratched with what appear to be biological markings and pests. SCP-502 does not contain an air supply with any current means to extract it.</p><p>If a human subject enters SCP-502 for a period over two hours, the subject will report that the statue is inhabited by organisms from the phyla arthropoda, mollusca and annelids. Although these organisms seem hostile initially, they become docile under the condition that their conditions are met. If these conditions are not met, subjects claim that SCP-502 will strangle them if they do not leave within sixty minutes of entering.</p><p>After reentering normal Earth biomes without further incident, subjects describe the organisms as "scary bugs". If SCP- 502 is entered again after this time period, subjects report that they have been changed into identical insects capable of child labor and constantly relocating to avoid predators. For example, the insect form takes on an appearance consistent with that of an ant lion. Subjects may also suffer deformities consistent with exposure to radiation or abnormal weather patterns (e.g., multiple legs broken off during a storm).</p><p>If you enter 521 for long amounts of time you will turn into a bug! - Dr. Peter Bloom</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
