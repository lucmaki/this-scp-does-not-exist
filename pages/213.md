<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-213</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Red-Object-</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-213 is contained in a spare containment locker at Site-77. Due to its anomalous properties, SCP-213 requires no outside power or heat sources, and has been successfully maintained over the course of its containment with only minimal maintenance.</p><p>Due to the nature of its anomalous properties, SCP-213 is only ever to be worn by personnel directly involved with testing. Any other personnel approaching SCP-213 must immediately leave the vicinity or suffer acute mental trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-213 is a pink cotton t-shirt, with white ink printed across the front of it. The letters "HNK" are printed on the front in black.</p><p>When worn by a human subject, SCP-213 will cause the subject to begin to hallucinate the appearance of a humanoid or lower lifeform, labeled as SCP-213-1 under the proper conditions.</p><p>SCP-213's anomalous properties put forth that testing is best conducted in close proximity to an actual D-Class personnel. When used for isolation testing, SCP-213 must be worn in conjunction with at least ██ (███) other D-Class personnel. No more than 3 additional D-Class personnel are acceptable for an experiment involving SCP-213.</p><p>The following conditions must be met in order for SCP-213 to function:</p><p>At this time, no one has successfully identified what the anomaly exactly is which causes SCP-213 to react this way. Given its anomalous properties, the Foundation has classified SCP-213 as a red object.</p><p>Red objects cannot be contained without extreme danger and failure to contain them can lead to catastrophic damage to Foundation property and personnel alike.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
