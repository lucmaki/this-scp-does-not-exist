<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-863</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-863 is currently held at Site-██. When the item is not being operated by the Foundation, it is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with at least three security personnel assigned to it. Access is limited to a level 2 keycard, which should be checked carefully for tampering. If SCP-863 is to be operated by an outside party, they are to be briefed on the nature of its anomalous properties, as well as the identity of its owner/operator in case of unauthorized removal of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-863 is a ten-stringed musical instrument, made of rosewood with a black lacquer finish. A scroll of parchment is attached to the item's handle, which bears a single inscription in Old High German:</p><p>Ein gezähmtes Wesen erfreut sich eines Eindrucks von Unverfrorenheit.</p><p>The parchment bears an illustration of a bipedal humanoid wearing an iron mask and carrying a wood-handled scythe. The humanoid's gender is impossible for an outside observer to determine, due to the lack of genitalia on its body. Though it is physically capable of vocal communication, this ability is not currently known to be used by SCP-863’s owner. The wearer of the mask has been hypothesized as follows:</p><p>All attempts to remove the mask from the object’s owner/operator have failed, with all subjects meeting similar fates as those who removed them. Bizarrely enough, removing the mask from SCP-863’s owner has no effect on their mental state or physical wellbeing; within twenty minutes after removing it, they will return to normal behaviour regardless of their mental state while wearing it. In addition, SCP-863 has proven extraordinarily difficult to alter in any way whatsoever, resisting all attempts at modifying the painting or writing on its scroll. Attempts have also been made to remove any nonanomalous objects attached to the instrument itself, but invariably this attempt would also result in failure and any alterations made would revert to their previous properties at the end of seventy-two hours.</p><p>For several years following its discovery in ████████, SCP-863 was kept at Site-██ and studied using Foundation researchers' best efforts. As such, SCP-863 has uncovered many previously unknown anomalous phenomena in its time under their care; some of which were catalogued below:</p><p>Scarabs were found adorning the scroll along with small dents made by human fingernails (which could be removed when SCP-863 was not being operated) over all major areas where parchment should be attached; resulting in a complete loss of distinct points on the image (see Addendum). These areas range from the top left corner that represents one side's torso region and another side's lower arms to large regions that contain numerous human faces and deities. Though such scarabs are usually not particularly unusual in pre-medieval artwork, they are most uncommon in pre-medieval works conventionally attributed to female authorship; these scarabs have been determined to come from somewhere very far away from Germany.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
