<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-404</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-404 is currently contained at Site 78. Personnel wishing to enter SCP-404 must first write down all items they wish to retrieve from within the containment chamber, and submit the list to Security Officer ████. All items not listed will be removed permanently, and the test subject denied access to SCP-404 until the next monthly review session.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-404 is a small island located 332 meters from the coast of ███████, ██████. The landmass itself appears to be composed of solid granite. All trees and other foliage on SCP-404 have been sterilized, removing any possibility for flora growth.</p><p>SCP-404 was discovered following reports of spontaneous combustion in various locations around ███████. Foundation Agents were able to track down the source of these fires to a small shack at the center of SCP-404, where they found the body of Dr. ███, founder of the ██████████ ██████████ company, who had been missing for 6 months. No cause of death could be determined due to incineration, but a piece of paper with Dr. ███’s handwriting was found next to his remains. On it was written “Show Off” in capital letters.</p><p>No further information has been discovered regarding Dr. ███ or SCP-404.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
