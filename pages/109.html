<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-109</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Partial Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-109 is currently contained at Site-███. In order to keep SCP-109 contained, it is placed in a standard containment chamber, which has been fitted with motion sensors and cameras. The chamber also contains a small table, upon which SCP-109 will usually sit in its containment chamber. To prevent potential escape attempts via this method, it is barred from the “front door” of its containment chamber, and all doors are locked.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-109 appears to be a 19 year old Caucasian male. Its current appearance and age are consistent with its age at time of anomalous manifestation in ████, USA, as well as it being 19 years old when it was originally contained. SCP-109's height is approximately 1.75 meters, and it weighs approximately 61 kg. SCP-109 does not appear to be capable of any sort of motion that would suggest being able to walk, and is unable to communicate.</p><p>SCP-109 displays the following anomalous properties:</p><p>Attempts to communicate with SCP-109 have proven unsuccessful. When spoken to, SCP-109 reacts as if its hearing is not functioning properly, and will make hand motions towards the source of the voice. It will make similar gestures when read the same text multiple times.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
