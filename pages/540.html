<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-540</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-540 instances are to be stored in standard containment locker 2865 at Site-██ for standard testing. Standard lighting, temperature and humidity settings are to be maintained inside these lockers.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-540 are human males between the ages of fifty and seventy, with extremely prominent facial features. These include a higher than normal forehead, prominent eyebrows, high cheekbones and thin lips. Facial pigmentation is exactly the same as an average human male. The skin of SCP-540 instances has shown no unusual texture or structure regardless of age or trauma sustained.</p><p>SCP-540 do not appear to have any physical reaction to the presence of other creatures such as humans or animals, although they appear to show more acute reactions towards hostile humans (fellow gangsters). Any type of human interaction will cause SCP-540 to react violently towards the aggressor.</p><p>SCP-540 are given their apparent designation due to their occupation: "gangster", "mobster" and similar terms. All SCP-540 instances have a different occupation and often use different names; however all prove to be very dedicated members of their individual crews. It is not currently known what job duties are carried out by these men. It is believed that location has a great impact on specific crew work as it appears that only certain crews operate in specific locations with little deviation between crews in other areas.</p><p>Instances of SCP-540 seem to vary in levels of aggression, with some appearing more active then others. However, most manifestations are still homicidal in nature, even if they are directed towards fellow gangsters rather then the enemy.</p><p>It is currently believed that at least three main gangs exist, each with different variations on the name but otherwise simple occupations: "The Bully", "21st Century Executioners" and "Kings of Crime".</p><p>Variations of SCP-540 behavior can completely change from day to day depending on certain situations. For instance, if there is a threat nearby such as a police officer or soldier then all instances will become completely docile and passive, attempting to surrender themselves for transportation out of the area without any resistance or violence. This response does not appear until after all personnel attempting to restrain them have been neutralized and they will give up no information regarding where they were taken or who their primary employers are unless specifically asked by one of their employers before they agree to cooperate.</p><p>There is also no evidence that these instances create any weapons or ammunition on their own.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
