<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-738</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation's Site-77 research facility is to be constructed in the northwest section of Grant County, Oklahoma. The containment procedure for SCP-738 when active is unknown, as it is currently stagnant. Therefore, its containment procedures are temporary until more information about its containment becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-738 is the designation for the Oklahoma oilfield in Grant County, Oklahoma, USA. It was given this designation on ██/██/19██. It has been undeveloped and uninhabited since its discovery.</p><p>SCP-738 possesses a mechanical system that is currently inactive, but could potentially be reactivated by an unknown means. SCP-738's mechanical system is composed of devices that are what are known as differentials: a device used to measure changes in pressure and fluids. The devices appear to be similar to those that are used in gasoline pumps, however they require no fuel or power source.</p><p>The main differential device appears to have time and date stamps engraved on it. When activated, SCP-738's system will begin counting down the time remaining until it reaches zero. This countdown can be stopped by destroying one of the devices (see Addendum 738.1).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
