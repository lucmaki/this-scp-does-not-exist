<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-614</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Areas in which SCP-614 is active are to be monitored for signs of SCP-614, and any Foundation staff or civilians entering the zone are to be administered amnestics.</p><p>Any affected areas inside the United States are to be restricted off-limits by local law enforcement, who are to be trained in the detection and tracking of SCP-614. All civilian reports of unusual activity within SCP-614 and its effect on humans are to be routed directly to MTF Mu-4 "Green Patrol" for investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-614 is an area which appears to be the immediate vicinity of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. SCP-614 has a radius of 90km, and a maximum range of 120km. SCP-614 alters its boundaries when it has absorbed enough ozone from the air. After this point, air within the zone will carry a build-up of ozone, necessitating a complete evacuation if even a small amount of ozone is detected within the zone's radius.</p><p>SCP-614 can be detected by the presence of several anomalous phenomena. In addition to the presence of ozone within the zone, humans and animals within SCP-614 will exhibit abnormal behavior for varying amounts of time; this time scale appears to be related to the concentration of ozone in their surroundings. The area affected by SCP-614 also exhibits a variety of effects within its range, ranging from geological effects (such as crackling noises) to simple hallucinations ("Manhole cover changed into something else.").</p><p>The primary effect caused by SCP-614 is that any human who approaches it will experience prominent changes in their perceptions and mental states. For example, at high concentrations, one individual may perceive themselves with superhuman physical abilities; others may see things that are not real or hear sounds below the threshold of hearing.</p><p>By studying these responses and noting the changes they cause in people on a daily basis, it is expected that Foundation staff will be able to predict when an area is entering into or has exited out of SCP-614's effect range.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
