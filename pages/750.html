<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-750</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All Foundation and other government agencies are to be made aware of - and, if applicable, provide assistance in solving - SCP-750's anomalous properties. Once a connection is established, Foundation agents will direct SCP-750-1 instances to Safe Item Storage Containers (SISCs) and Class A Amnestics into the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-750 is a black briefcase with an attached strap. On the outside, it is adorned with the words "Departments of Military Science and Astronautics." Each time SCP-750 persists without opening, the sticker on the outside changes to display a different government agency. As of yet, SCP-750 has proven immune to all attempts to open it or otherwise damage it.</p><p>When an individual carrying SCP-750 opens SCP-750, SCP-750-1 instances will appear within 2-3 meters of the subject. If a human being is present, SCP-750-1 instances will pose as members of the relevant governmental department and attempt to make conversation with them (or any other person present). If a non-human entity is present, SCP-750-1 instances will attempt to deceive them into allowing them to enter their home for purposes unknown.</p><p>SCP-750 was recovered from the home of Dr. James Kim after his death by electrocution on 27 February 2013 in ███████, South Korea. Forensic analysis of his home found no trace of anomalous activity.</p><p>SCP-750 was originally discovered as follows:</p><p>On 9 January 2015, Foundation agents located in ████ were alerted to what they described as "unidentified civilians" appearing in front of local institutions and residents asking if they could get inside (the Foundation had been attempting to apprehend the entities prior). Agents began tracking these civilians and soon learned that they were part of SCP-750's anomalous properties. Foundation forces were deployed to intercept these civilians; these forces are now directed against said civilians rather than the entities themselves for security reasons.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
