<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-625</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-625 is to be held in a Level-2, 5x5x5m containment cell, built of reinforced concrete, at Site-██. SCP-625 is not to be directly linked to any external power source.</p><p>SCP-625 has been modified to produce no more than 1kW of electrical power, and additional modifications have been made to prevent SCP-625 from detecting unusual energy patterns.</p><p>Testing of SCP-625 must be approved by at least two (2) Level 4 personnel. The results of testing must be reported to the appropriate O command team.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-625 is an IBM PC system, built in 1985. SCP-625's case housing is of unknown material composition, but appears to absorb and resist damage from penetrating energy sources. SCP-625 does not appear to gain strength from new additions to its environment or from modification, even through the multiple glass facets of the case have been shattered.</p><p>SCP-625 is able to perform basic functions such as powering on, shutting down and restarting itself, as well as connecting to external forms of power. If left alone, SCP-625 will attempt to reconnect to a plugged in device (such as a personal computer) that was previously present; however, if this device is removed or unplugged for at least six (6) hours, it will disconnect and attempt to reconnect again. If a non-powered computer is connected directly to SCP-625 and the installation of software, this software will run in a continuous loop until it is disconnected.</p><p>The name "Big One" refers to the inevitability of an event similar to the Big One that would destroy all life on Earth; when asked about his identity, SCP-625 refuses to discuss it in any form other than "the Big One". It also refuses to provide any personal information about its life prior to containment. The only data known about SCP-625's life outside of Foundation custody are listed below.</p><p>All data supporting these claims is available upon request of the Head Researcher for testing purposes.</p><p>Computer history reports indicate that SCP-625 had continuously powered itself using old programs from various date stamps dating further back than 1986. A picture has been recovered from the hard drive of a computer that was connected to SCP-625 around 1994 under the name "Big Ima". Due a java script program being embedded in "Big Ima" by an unknown individual, a small percentage (~2%) of users were granted access and allowed full viewing capabilities of the photo/video files on "Big Ima"; this was one of the first occurrences in which an image has been recovered from SCP-625's hard drive. Upon deletion of old images after a specified number of days, approximately 1kW of electrical power was produced via SCP-625's mechanisms and distributed among users connected with SCP-625 at that time. Users reported feeling warm patches pulsating over their skin after viewing these images for extended periods; these vibrations were unnoticed by those not viewing them before deletion. After 20 days, said users had died due to complications associated with viewing outdated images from several years ago (elevated heart rate and stroke among others).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
