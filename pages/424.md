<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-424</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized (dec</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-424 has been officially classified as a New York-type urban legend. All individuals involved with SCP-424 are to be contained within Site-17's Low-Value Item Storage Unit (LVISU) immediately after the conclusion of their encounters with SCP-424.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-424 is a series of urban legends about low-end electronics and digital devices manufactured by █████ Corporation (formally ██████████████ Corporation). These devices include the ██████ brand of high capacity flash drives, as well as various pirated ██████ flash drives, network storage units, and other devices.</p><p>According to SCP-424, the █████ Corporation has developed a system that allows it to keep customers purchasing its products hooked long enough to make them pay more than they expected. This is accomplished by installing an elaborate series of traps in their product packaging. To date, these stories have been proven false; the █████ Corporation has made no attempt at tracking down either SCP-424's creator(s) or their methods for perpetuating it.</p><p>These stories claim that:</p><p>Within three months of exposure to these rumors, almost all individuals affected by exposure will purchase one or more █████ Corporation products.</p><p>The chances of this only increasing with each successive iteration of SCP-424 are unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
