<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-256</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-256 is to be referred to as "The No Pants Joke" and examples of SCP-256-A should be made available to personnel which have previously participated in this study. If a test subject reports an instance of SCP-256, they are to be restrained and subjected to the standard interview process before testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-256 is the phenomenon where personnel lack adequate trousers. Patients experience various symptoms which are listed in the table below.</p><p>SCP-256 is not directly dangerous, but it can cause psychological damage if the individual becomes distressed by their condition or takes part in inappropriate behavior to avoid noticing. For added safety, testing is performed on research personnel and other staff members with no direct exposure to risk, or require showing respect to a higher authority.</p><p>As of 30/12/20██, the Foundation has contained 1517 paper records of SCP-256 (190 various universities and public schools). Of these records, 1008 instances involved staff and 1037 instances involved students.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
