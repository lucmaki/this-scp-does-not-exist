<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-313</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-313 is to be kept within a temperature regulated storage unit in Site-18. The unit is to be led through an automated system of checks and balances when opened, and any changes to the object's state are to be recorded by the monitoring team present. The object is to be stored under constant observation of its surface, with any movements noted and a report sent to security. Testing of SCP-313 is restricted on the base of experiment log 313. All testing of the object must be approved by O-█.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-313 is a metal box of unknown size, with a lid of the same material. The object's surface is covered in writing in Latin, with no visible symbols or language. Despite this, the writing is intelligible to trained linguists and scholars.</p><p>When opened, SCP-313 emits a bright beam that extends along its length. When a human being stands within this beam while it is powered up, they will be teleported to a location outside of SCP-313's current range (approx. 5km). The teleportation process has not been observed to be accompanied by any damage to the person teleported.</p><p>SCP-313 does not appear to require any form of power to function, as it has been inactive for over half a century and still functions (although only if the object's lid remains closed). At the time of its discovery, the object was stored within an abandoned warehouse on ██████, with faint writing partially covering its surface. The warehouse was gutted by unknown persons one week after it was discovered, but it appears likely that they were trying to "clean" the site prior to reoccupation by Foundation staff. Newspaper clippings from ████████████ detailing the incident have since been recovered.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
