<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-523</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A high-voltage isolation chamber is to be constructed around SCP-523. No SCP objects are to be released inside said chamber, and subjects attempting to do so are to be detained and questioned. Subjects may remove SCP-523 in order to relieve themselves, but they must return it immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-523 is an anomalous worm-like organism, 2 cm long, 1 mm wide and 60 mm long, with a body composed of shed skin cells, called dermal papillae. The dermal papillae are arranged into an arrangement resembling a human colon, or enema. SCP-523 is able to be removed from the human digestive system.</p><p>SCP-523 is able to absorb nutrients through the skin of the human on whom it resides, and has already been observed to remove water and food substances. An adult human can support up to 10 small SCP-523 colonies.</p><p>SCP-523 has been able to breed with other known humanoid organisms such as humans, canines, felines, "mammals", etc. In such a case, the potential offspring is completely homogeneous in its genetics and appearance.</p><p>When removed from a human host after breeding with one of said species, SCP-523 will undergo metamorphosis and will rapidly attain cloud-like qualities with various sizes and shapes of "items" resembling ribosomes within them. The extent to which said structures enlarge upon development depends on how many resources the SCP object assimilated into its cells during its development. The smaller the individual creature was when it was first infected with SCP-523 (but not before), the larger its item formation will be once matured.</p><p>SCP-523 acquires additional items by feeding off of:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
