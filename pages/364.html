<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-364</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-364 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, equipped with one (1) video capture card and one (1) video storage medium. SCP-364 is to be monitored remotely at all times via the use of Foundation surveillance drones. In the event that SCP-364's location or activities are detected, no fewer than twelve (12) Foundation operatives are to be dispatched immediately to investigate the location of SCP-364.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-364 is a standard Ockham razor toothed comb, measuring approximately 8.5 cm in length with a 1.1 cm wide head. SCP-364's appearance is that of any other standard Ockham razor toothed comb, except its steel teeth are uniformly engraved with ‘QUOTE' in capital print, 10 mm tall and spaced 15 mm apart. When held in the hand and shifted to one corner of the comb head, it is found that the inscription reads perfectly legible upside-down. Upon holding SCP-364 inverted, it appears normal to the naked eye; however, when the blade is turned around and viewed from above, the inscription "QUOTE" can be seen perfectly.</p><p>When not being used or otherwise under observation, SCP-364 behaves identically to any other Ockham razor toothed comb. SCP-364 was discovered with SCP-364-1 attached to it by Agents G█████ and Y█████. SCP-364 was recovered from a small shop in ████████ during routine Foundation surveillance duties following an encounter with Agent Y█████ who had reported experiencing the unusual effects after receiving a shave from an unassuming barber.</p><p>SCP-364-1 is a small piece of paper affixed to the underside of SCP-364's handle. The paper measures 0.8 cm x 0.7 cm and contains two short sentences written in black marker pen:</p><p>“This is my first nail file. I will never get better than this.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
