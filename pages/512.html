<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-512</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-512 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, lined with tarpaulin and concrete. SCP-512's restraints are to be padded and locked in place. Its food ration is to consist of one (1) chocolate bar each day.</p><p>As of 20██, SCP-512 has been assigned the identity █████ ██████ and is currently housed in Site 69's Behavioral Sciences Wing, where it is allowed access to recreational reading materials at the discretion of its psychological team.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-512 appears to be a Caucasian male of age fifty. SCP-512 possesses no distinguishing physical abnormalities other than its eyes, which appear to have been removed at some point prior to its classification.</p><p>SCP-512's behavior is virtually identical to that of a nonanomalous human being, aside from the following:</p><p>SCP-512 has not demonstrated any ability to vocalize or interact with other individuals aside from the Foundation personnel assigned to work with it. Attempts to infect individuals with SCP-512 are currently prohibited by O-class personnel.</p><p>SCP-512's relationship with the Foundation is unclear; it claims to have been approached by an unnamed individual, who provided it with an envelope containing several hundred US dollars, as well as instructions for how to reach the Foundation's anomalous properties division.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
