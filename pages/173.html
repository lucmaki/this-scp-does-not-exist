<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-173</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of 2018, the Foundation has determined that SCP-173 instances and SCP-173's "label"—the poster printed on the back of each instance—are two different entities. Though the label can be destroyed or removed from an instance, it will presumably continue to exist even in the absence of the instance. As such, all instances are stored as individual artifacts in Site-██ with no labels attached. Objects with similarities to SCP-173, including copies, should be kept in Site-██'s anomalous item wing for comparison.</p><p>Currently, there are 11 known instances of SCP-173 in containment at Site-██. Instances that were previously classified as SCP-173 have the following designations:</p><p>As of 2014, SCP-173 is believed to be located at Site-██, after which it is to be transferred to Foundation control.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-173 is a collection of six wooden boards, each measuring 1.2 m in length, 0.9 m in width and 0.3 m in thickness. Each board is painted with the word "WARNING" printed on the reverse side above a crudely-drawn image of a humanoid figure, usually depicted as nude or partially clothed. The figure depicted varies between instances; SCP-173 has been observed to depict figures of all genders and ages, although males have been seen more frequently (see Addendum 173-1).</p><p>Individuals viewing an instance of SCP-173 are consistently unable to find the word "WARNING" printed on it. Attempts to do so typically result in the words "I CAN'T FIND IT" being written. When a person searches for the word "WARNING", they typically focus on specific portions of the boards intended to do so, often focusing on the figures' faces and hands. When examining the labels attached to these boards, personnel are often able to discern the designations of several other Foundation sites around the world.</p><p>As with all instances of SCP-173, those that have labels attached are believed to originate from Site-██ and were produced after 2012; however, no markings indicate where these labels originated from or how much time passed between their production and when they were placed on SCP-173's instances.</p><p>When an individual tries to examine an SCP-173 instance without its label attached, they instead view a 35mm black and white photograph depicting a blonde female standing beside a dilapidated building marked with a sign reading "asdada". In addition, personnel will claim that whatever objects they search for with their eyes remain stationary despite there being no discernible source for viewing them; additionally, any attempts at concealing this fact during examinations will result in claims that they did not see anything or that they have already searched that area.</p><p>SCP-173 was discovered by Agent ██████ during his investigation of reports regarding missing persons associated with an abandoned mansion located 1.24 km from ████████, ██████ linked to [REDACTED]. At this site, he found 10 anomalous objects including SCP-173 and 37 photographs (See addendum 173-2). All items were collected by Foundation agents and transported into Site-██'s anomalous item wing where all individuals were detained; however, Agent ██████ disappeared from Site-██ before he could be interviewed and Class A amnestics were administered to all witnesses (See addendum 173-3). After discovering photographs from his investigation related to multiple Foundation and civilian sites around the world (see addendum 173-4), Agent ██████ was assigned as lead researcher on documenting SCP-173's anomalies.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
