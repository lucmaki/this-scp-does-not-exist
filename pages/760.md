<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-760</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-760 is kept in a sealed container on site at Site-72. A small opening is present in the side of the container to allow for periodic sample collection, and any personnel may use this opening to enter the containment chamber. The exterior of SCP-760's container is to be continually monitored to ensure no additional damage is caused.</p><p>The container holding SCP-760 is to be kept in a sealed lab facility located under the guise of an oceanographic observatory. This facility is to maintain the integrity of its Foundation cover story and be inspected by Mobile Task Force Pi-2 ("Demons") members at least once per month. Only those members of Pi-2 have access to this facility, which has been named "Site Sea".</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-760 is a model of the Comet Hyakutake, discovered in March 2005 by Japanese researchers during an expedition to study the aurora. After its recovery, SCP-760 was stored at Site-72 and examined by Foundation personnel. The layout of SCP-760's interior matches that of Hyakutake, with the exception being a room containing various forms of life, which appear to be survivors of some kind. Based on the conditions of the "survivor's" existence, it is theorized that SCP-760 arrived on Earth after the end of a global flood approximately 5,000 years ago.</p><p>SCP-760 is filled with an unidentified liquid substance that remains at exactly body temperature (37 degrees Celsius) no matter how cold or hot the containment chamber is. This liquid also does not shrink beneath pressure. This liquid contains traces of all surface lifeforms; aside from humans and other mammalian species, all aquatic or amphibious animal lifeforms are present along with plants and some types of fungi. It should be noted that due to the quantity of organic matter in this mixture and the effects it has on living tissue, only small samples can be safely removed from inside SCP-760 by means other than human physical contact for extended periods of time.</p><p>The substances contained within SCP-760 have been described as "familiar", despite never having encountered each other before. Commonalities include:</p><p>Although these similarities are present in hundreds to thousands of organisms present throughout SCP-760's interior, they do not appear to be related to a single source.</p><p>Several attempts have been made to extract DNA from these organisms and use it to breed new species outside of SCP-760; although they are able to reproduce normally both outside and inside SCP-760, all specimens grown in this manner show no signs of any resemblance to the original creatures contained within. Attempts to breed a new human species using genetic material found in SCP-760 have been similarly unsuccessful.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
