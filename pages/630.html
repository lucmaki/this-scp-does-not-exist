<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-630</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Access to SCP-630 is limited solely to personnel with level 3 clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-630 is a battered copy of the board game "Sorry!", which has been completely covered in fluorescent paint and stickers. The object's anomalous properties manifest when it is played by an entity without prior knowledge of its existence.</p><p>When the player rolls a die that results in a number greater than 20, they immediately win the game. The winner then becomes capable of altering the game's rules at will, and must force all players to comply with its new rules.</p><p>If the player wins more than once before anyone else rolls, they are able to become subject to the SCP's anomalous effects. All other players lose their turns and must confer with the new winner.</p><p>Attempts to gain access to SCP-630 by non-anomalous means have been unsuccessful; however, several individuals have managed to find the object through its anomalous properties, mostly as a result of winning against themselves.</p><p>The list below contains all instances of SCP-630 that have been catalogued:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
