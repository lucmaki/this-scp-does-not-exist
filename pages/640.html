<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-640</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-640 is to be physically confined in a fitting room in its home at Site-64. Environmental conditions are to be controlled to keep its water supply at 5°C and below. A recording of SCP-640's vocalizations has been provided to the Foundation natural history recording archive for study.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-640 is a 1.5 meter (5 ft) long walrus, known colloquially as "the whale of the sky". Its approximate weight is estimated at 650 kilograms (1,433 lbs). SCP-640's body is covered in blackish brown fur, and has three pairs of flippers. The most unusual aspect of SCP-640's anatomy is its long, tapered tusk, which extends out of the upper jaw and curves upward before merging into the lower jaw.</p><p>SCP-640 prefers to vocalize through the use of this tusk, producing various low frequency sounds that are described by SCP-640 as music. It also uses this tusk to perform acrobatics, occasionally flinging itself from one side of the fitting room to another using its flippers.</p><p>SCP-640 spends most of its time in a 19 square meter (200 square feet) area within a single room. This area consists of an elevated platform overlooking a demonstration tank containing water at 5°C and below. For reasons unknown, SCP-640 moves around on the platform rather than staying in one place while performing musical performances or acrobatics, possibly due to its limited mobility when confined to this area. When prompted to do so by personnel touring SCP-640's containment area, it will perform these activities on an outside balcony provided it can reach it.</p><p>SCP-640 has previously been recorded engaging in scientific research involving experimentation with liquefaction and magnetism. The following is an excerpted log of an experiment performed by SCP-640 in the summer of 2009:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
