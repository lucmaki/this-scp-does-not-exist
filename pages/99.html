<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-99</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No special containment procedures are required for SCP-99. All information regarding SCP-99 should be obtained from the Foundation website.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-99 is a website that allows users to design their own ██████-class supertankers. Anyone who submits an SCP-99 design will be granted access to the facilities and personnel of ECODESIGN, LLC to assist in the creation of said design.</p><p>SCP-99 was originally registered by Charles P. Popp (also known as "ECODESIGN") as a US trademark on January 2nd, 2008. A company was registered under ECODESIGN's name with no additional connections. Testing has revealed that ECODESIGN's location matches that of a large office building owned by Deutsche Bank in Berlin, Germany. It is not clear why Popp chose this location for his business; however, the German Government requires businesses to have a place of residence within their country in order to maintain tax revenue.</p><p>SCP-99 will display a logo with an object resembling a very large tank and write "Welcome Because You Can" in white text on its main page. After this message has been displayed, it will disappear and be replaced by information regarding SCP-99's event system and a list of events that are currently available for design. Events seem to come about at random; however, all events show dates approximately two years away from present day. On additional pages accessed via the search box, it is revealed that these events center around tankers of the ██████ class carrying oil or other products through marine environments such as the Arctic Ocean. Users can sign up in order to create one such tanker using any combination of parts from the current set: hull, propulsion units, crew quarters and cargo hold(s). Items can be combined from more than one event; however, each part must be listed separately due to different lengths for each part of the plot.</p><p>All parts of an event must have any amount of plot possible for them; users are not allowed to combine less than four separate plot storylines into one event unless they make it eligible for multiple awards at once (for example, letting them win both Best World Product and Best Plot). Event submissions costing over 50 USD require approval from an individual from ECODESIGN before submission is accepted; further information is given in the instructions before submission. It is not known how SCP-99 selects winners; however, all winners have been contacted by SCP-99 staff after completing their apparently randomly-chosen plot storyline(s).</p><p>Users cannot edit or delete their submitted plot without permission from ECODESIGN staff.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
