<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-734</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-734 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Sector-19. The lock is to be kept locked and the key is to be kept in a secure location. Any SCP-734 instances removed from their original location should be placed in a standard containment locker, and the incident reports filed by staff of the school should be forwarded to Dr. ████ for review.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-734 is a stack of school report cards identical in design and size to those handed out by ██████ High School, the school attended by the subject. However, each card carries a different grade from 1 to 4. The grade on each card is always consistent with the subject's actual grade, but is typically lower than the expected grade due to academic deficiencies.</p><p>When a human being reads one of these cards, they will experience an anomalous incident at their current place of residence. This event appears as a sudden drop in their average grades or test scores; this average will stay low until the subject graduates or otherwise leaves their current location. In some cases, this drop may be significant enough that the subject's expected career paths are altered (see Incident 734-B). Subjects affected by SCP-734 are unable to comment on their grades or improvements in any way.</p><p>Incident Summary:</p><p>Date: ██/██/2013</p><p>Subject: Subject ██████ ██████</p><p>Location: [REDACTED]</p><p>Observed Grade Change: ██%</p><p>Notes: Subject was found erasing student notes from a textbook and replacing them with blank pages during study period. Subject's parents were contacted for questioning.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
