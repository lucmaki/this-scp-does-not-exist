<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-329</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has set up a special containment unit at Research Site-77 in a remote area just outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. The area is under constant watch by security personnel and the building itself is structurally sound. A backup site has been established in the same general area.</p><p>All personnel entering this area are to wear Level 3 protection gear at all times. In addition to stopping anyone from passing through the containment chamber door, these measures can be used to prevent entry or exit of objects or organisms into SCP-329-A. Personnel entering SCP-329-A are required to wear Level 4 protection equipment at all times; this requirement extends to all individuals interacting with SCP-329-A at any point (see Addendum 329-2).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-329 is a single, standard cabin with multiple rooms inside.</p><p>SCP-329-A is the main room of SCP-329 and is accessible from outside SCP-329 through the door on the far side of the room. The walls and floor of SCP-329-A are an anomalous material that does not respond to any baryonic matter. This material cannot be seen with the naked eye; X-ray analysis shows it as being composed of a fine dust similar to talcum powder. This substance is infusible and can only be dissolved by a saline solution; when wetted, the powder swells into a gelatinous mass approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. As this material has a solid state, it is impervious to physical damage; however, it will eventually wear away a surface if continually exposed to use or neglect.</p><p>This material is identical to that produced by naturally occurring albinism and not due to any form of plastic surgery.</p><p>On all sides of this room are numerous soft sculptures, including human figures and animals made from it, arranged in patterns (see Addendum 329-3). These sculptures are completely anatomically correct; none show evidence of artificial modification or alteration by genetic engineering methods or other unnatural means. Most have been carved from the substance from above the level at which it swells. In addition, all individual parts within these sculptures appear to be made of identical organic materials resembling collagen and keratin proteins in atomic detail.</p><p>The floor material on all sides also contains numerous instances of rusted metal objects arranged in logs in exactly the same way as the clay sculptures but with no sign of weathering or deterioration. All individual metals have atomic compositions identical to their more common non-anomalous cousins (except several rare cases where corrosion has resulted in a molecule shift change in some metals).</p><p>Every year on 12/12/12 at 11:11, SCP-329 will produce an instance of SCP-329-B within itself. The instance will contain no lifeforms or other anomalous substances unless brought in. Attempts to remove everything except SCP-329 and an instance of SCP-329-B have proven futile; they always reappear inside SCP-329 after being removed (and even reappear inside an empty case) until they are disposed of properly.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
