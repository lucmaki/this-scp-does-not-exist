<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-450</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation possesses a fleet of Cheyenne-class light cruisers, equipped with the standard containment and shielding systems employed by the Foundation. A single Cheyenne-class light cruiser, designated SCP-450, is to be kept in Foundation custody at all times.</p><p>SCP-450 is to remain within containment for its own protection, and for the purpose of providing cover for Foundation operations against novel anomalous objects.</p><p>Any attempt at physically removing SCP-450 from containment without express permission from Level 4 personnel is to be treated as Class III Incident: Protocol Delegatio Omnia Verba. Failure to comply with this protocol may result in the death of all personnel involved in said operation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-450 is a black 1935 Dodge touring car, built for wealthy American heiress Evalyn Knapp.</p><p>SCP-450 is capable of autonomous movement via the use of an onboard AI. SCP-450 has been observed to travel between [DATA EXPUNGED] and other cities, including [EXPUNGED]. SCP-450 is not affected by shielding or other anomalous forces. SCP-450 does not exhibit any anomalous properties when traveling inside Foundation facilities. SCP-450 does not appear to be directly connected to any anomalous objects, functions, or entities.</p><p>Were it to be removed from containment, SCP-450 would attempt to return to its current location within 14 days.</p><p>Attempts at removing SCP-450 from its current location have resulted in the death of numerous individuals and damage to Foundation facilities used in testing related to SCP-450 (see Incident Log 450).</p><p>Incident 450/5: On 20/09/2009, personnel monitoring the cameras positioned around the site where SCP-450 was stored were surprised to witness the car traveling rapidly toward Site 19's main entrance. At this point, all attempts at halting SCP-450 were rendered moot. Fortunately, personnel stationed at the entrance managed to capture a few still images of SCP-450 with their cell phone cameras before the car moved into an area that obscured the view of its license plate. The guard on duty during this incident reported finding a small envelope attached to the windshield at that time. The envelope was subsequently opened by security personnel and contained a note that read "You need blood". After several attempts by security personnel to contact the original sender through voice mail and email failed horribly, communication was reestablished with Agent ██████'s handler in order that she be questioned as to the whereabouts of her employer. According to Agent ██████'s handler, Agent ██████ had appeared shaken up and appeared unwilling or unable to discuss any information regarding her past experiences with SCP-███ during class that day. Due to severe losses in Class D staffing due to high attrition rate among these workers over █ months per year, such incidents are not uncommon and do not require immediate action from Level 3 personnel unless accompanied by damaging physical manifestations.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
