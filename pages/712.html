<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-712</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-712 is contained in a 6m x 6m x 6m clear-topped containment cell located on Site-██. Standard environmental controls are to be maintained at all times, along with security cameras within the cell.</p><p>Automatic feeding devices are to be linked to SCP-712's enclosure via standard intravenous feed lines. All personnel entering the cell are to enter through a standard biohazard containment chamber, decontaminate and wear disposable plastic gowns.</p><p>"Mass Storage Device" is allowed access only with approval from level 3 personnel. No computer or video game related storage devices are allowed access to SCP-712.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-712 is a hand operated portable device, approximately 1.5m in length, 30cm wide and 15cm high.</p><p>On top of the device is a touch screen display, with eight buttons arranged around the edges. When the device is powered on, its screens display a series of random images. These images appear to depict scenes while playing various computer/video games. The images are static, non-moving and do not change in any way as the game progresses.</p><p>SCP-712 was discovered during an investigation into the break-in at a home in ██████, New York, following complaints of loud banging noises emanating from the home. SCP-712 was found in one of the bedrooms in the home. SCP-712 is believed to have been used for several months by an individual who has since disappeared.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
