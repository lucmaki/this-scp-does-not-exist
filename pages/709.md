<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-709</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All information related to SCP-709 is to be kept from the public at all cost. Foundation assets have been deployed to every major city in the world to monitor for any instances of manifestations of SCP-709, regardless of location. Under no circumstances are any records of SCP-709 or its effects to be released to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-709 is a phenomenon in which advertisements will randomly appear on various surfaces in the world. Instances of SCP-709 display anomalous properties, and can only be seen and heard by sensitive individuals such as researchers working for the Foundation. The advertisement displayed by SCP-709 instances is, by all means, an extremely cheap advertisement for a product of apparently no value to the consumer.</p><p>While not every instance of SCP-709 leads to an amnestic object manifesting when read, less than 0.2% do so. Fortunately, these objects act more or less as ordinary advertisements, with a minor effect on consumer behavior that is usually negligible at first, leading to their subsequent removal from the market within a few months.</p><p>SCP-709 was discovered by Foundation agents among a large number of advertisements located outside London. After investigation via surveillance and codewords, it was found to be an alternate reality version of this series of events.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
