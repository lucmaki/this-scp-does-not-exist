<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-482</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-482 is currently contained in a standard containment chamber, containing a single rack of computer equipment. The chamber's door must remain closed at all times, and the lighting must remain on for the duration of a trial.</p><p>If one of four indications is met during any trial, including but not limited to:</p><p>Special attention must be paid to the audio channels where SCP-482 is being recorded; if any of these channels go out of order, the recording must cease immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-482 is a set of five monitors displaying five separate windows with interactive activities. To successfully complete the trial, the user must perform the activity in each window. In addition to being able to see the activity, users are also able to hear and interact with the event.</p><p>Once completed, the result will be displayed in each window. The result can range from SCP-482's perspective, SCP-482's perspective with the removal of an item, or a third party's perspective.</p><p>Each activity has been observed to function differently on different computers.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
