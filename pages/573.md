<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-573</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> One-A</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-573 is to be kept in a sealed, pressurized storage unit at Storage Containment Locker Four (SCP-573). The interior wall of the containment chamber is to have a security camera installed and the chamber may only be accessed by approved personnel with level 4 clearance. A water tank containing liquid nitrogen is to be kept within SCP-573 for temperature control.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-573 is a small, spherical room measuring 12 meters in diameter and 6 meters in height (approximately 933 sq ft). The interior of SCP-573 has a temperature of -200°C.</p><p>The air within SCP-573 is devoid of all Earthly matter, except for a few types of oxygen, fluorine, hydrogen and nitrogen molecules that have not yet been observed in the atmosphere of any planet or moon. This plasma may be caused by a process similar to that which causes solar flares. The plasma is visible as a green-tinged plasma, but this coloration has no effect on the plasma itself.</p><p>Granting passes from Dr. Valerius (level 4 clearance) to other Foundation personnel is permitted on an individual basis for testing purposes only. Any attempt by unauthorized personnel to enter or exit SCP-573 will result in immediate termination, aside from research and testing personnel.</p><p>Any human or animal with eyes capable of detecting light between approximately 400nm and 780nm will be able to enter and exit SCP-573 without issue; however, such organisms are also incapable of observing the plasma within SCP-573 when inside and cannot breathe. This causes severe damage to the organism's lungs until they either suffocate or burn their eyes out. When exiting, non-exposed animals are cured of burning eyes upon exiting the chamber and will regain normal vision following exposure to natural sunlight. Non-human organisms exposed to SCP-573 become permanently blind if their eyes are burned during exposure to the body plasma. Resin growths have been observed on eyes after prolonged exposure among some of these organisms.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
