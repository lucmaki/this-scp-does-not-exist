<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-908</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-908 is contained in a containment locker at Site-19, located in the Heline Laboratory. SCP-908 has been fitted with electronic surveillance equipment at the request of Dr. Heline, with testing focused on SCP-908's anomalous properties.</p><p>Requests for reagent testing should be submitted and approved by Dr. Heline. All testing must be done through Dr. Heline or her assistant, and must not include any live human subjects.</p><p>Experimentation with SCP-908 outside of testing and approved experiments requires Level 3 clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-908 is an object, approximately 20 cm tall, with a transparent plastic dome on top. The object appears to be filled with a viscous liquid. SCP-908 is labelled as "Attention: Do Not Open!".</p><p>When opened, the liquid contained within SCP-908 begins to rapidly evaporate. Instances of SCP-908 are expected to contain approximately 1.2 grams (70 mL) of liquid. Due to its volatility, no attempt has been made to weigh SCP-908. Larger numbers of instances may exist within the object, but these are believed to be nonanomalous liquids such as oil and water.</p><p>Poisoning by ingestion of an instance of SCP-908 will result in severe gastrointestinal distress, vomiting and diarrhea for up to 18 hours. Victims will suffer from dehydration and electrolyte imbalance and possible permanent damage in their gastrointestinal tracts. Exposure to high temperatures or prolonged exposure will also hasten the effects of SCP-908 poisoning. Symptoms begin after 4 hours and can worsen over the next few hours until death occurs 24 - 48 hours later. Death by dehydration has been reported in tests with living subjects surviving at least 72 hours after contact with SCP-908 had been removed.</p><p>As stated above, ingestions of instances have been documented through testing. The substance within SCP-908 has not survived testing, but attempts have been made, including the use of concentrated hydrochloric acid and acetic acid, to reveal if any chemical components exist within the substance other than water (see document 908-EX). Failure to do so is due to the volatility of the substance within SCP-908, not necessarily any lack of it. Further research into this phenomenon is ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
