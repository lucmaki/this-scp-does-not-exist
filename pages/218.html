<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-218</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Anomalous</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-218 is kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Food and water are to be dispensed through a small hatch in the wall, which is to remain closed at all times. Should SCP-218 manifest any symptoms of distress, personnel are required to remove their shoes before approaching.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-218 is a Caucasian female humanoid.</p><p>SCP-218's sole extremity is non-anomalous, with the exception of possessing five toes. SCP-218 is otherwise completely human in all other respects.</p><p>When more than one person is present within SCP-218's room, SCP-218 will manifest anomalous effects. In the presence of two people, SCP-218 will produce a pair of raised hardened pads on its feet, which exhibit all qualities of leather shoes and will remain deployed until retracted.</p><p>SCP-218 seems to enjoy running and various athletic activities, and will not hesitate to show this off in front of staff.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
