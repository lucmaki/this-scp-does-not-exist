<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-829</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-829 is contained in a standard containment locker at Site-19. Access to the object is restricted to personnel wearing Level 2 Hazmat suits. Non-employee personnel are not permitted to handle SCP-829 unless they have undergone a pre-testing period.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-829 is a collection of six small metallic feathers, with a total length of 170 mm. The feathers are defined by a material composition of antimatter and a high degree of bioregional diversity among the individual feathers. SCP-829 resembles closely the quills of a common chicken, differing only in their metallic composition.</p><p>The average mass of SCP-829 is approximately 0.1 grams; when handled individually, the feathers have negligible weight. Despite this, SCP-829 and its individual feathers possess anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-829 has the ability to attract, and subsequently repel, physical matter; as such, it can be used to create temporary pockets of momentum with which to interact with objects. A person holding an object will begin levitating in the direction they were trying to bring the object toward, until they are no longer holding an object at all. This can cause objects weighing up to 20 kilograms to become airborne for periods of time exceeding 3 minutes unless affected by an anti-gravity device or otherwise physically prevented from flying. Objects affected this way can sometimes be seen or heard flying away from the subject at varying speeds before disappearing completely if they are large enough (such as vehicles) or landing somewhere else if they are not (such as instances of paper notes).</p><p>If multiple individuals attempt to use SCP-829 on the same object simultaneously, they will attempt to cooperate in order to carry out an action on it at once; as such, attempts to hasten or prolong the process via multiple people may be counterproductive, depending on what is desired. Several tests have shown that attempting to move multiple people at once toward an object is unlikely to produce any noticeable results; however, several tests have shown that a single subject holding 2 or more people simultaneously will be able to affect them in ways that vary significantly depending on the number of people often varying from temporarily rising into the air (henceforth referred to as "mass gathering"), causing one's immediate surroundings to suddenly fade and then re-appear elsewhere for short periods but always within a range of about 500 meters and usually varying randomly between 0 and 10 seconds in duration, after which all groups are dropped/jumped/thrown into thin air/the floor with slight injuries and dizziness lasting no more than 5 seconds while blood gradually returns back into circulation thus being able to repeat this process again without any visible harm until experimentally concluded.</p><p>It should also be noted that SCP-829 has only been observed during tests performed in Site 19's standard containment chamber; attempts using other environments have not yet produced any results.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
