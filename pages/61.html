<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-61</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-61 is to be held in a low security storage locker at Site-19. No special precautions are to be taken for its containment, other than providing it with at least one (1) large cage and at least one (1) box of food per day.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-61 is a common house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) with a current weight of 4.5 grams. SCP-61 displays no unusual behaviour, other than an increased interest in seeds, fruits, and insects. Any objects placed within the cage are consumed by SCP-61 at approximately the same speed as human consumption. In order for food to appear, use must be made of a food dispenser of greater volume than SCP-61's current body mass is capable of consuming.</p><p>When not consuming food from its containment, SCP-61 takes to a tree (of average size) and perches approximately five (5) meters up. At all times it will move to the nearest tree structure, but otherwise shows no great curiosity regarding them. It has been found that the only time SCP-61 falls from its perch is when it is given a direct order in this way.</p><p>The current theory concerning how SCP-61 came to be contained [EXTRACT]</p><p>SCP-61 was discovered following reports of "Finches with human brains" in southern Mexico City. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and arrived at the scene to find SCP-61 wandering aimlessly around the city, occasionally attempting to return to its home. Agents then brought it back to Site-19 for further investigation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
