<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-73</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation no longer monitors SCP-73, and the site appears to be occupied by a local high school in ██████, █████. SCP-73 is not to be interacted with by personnel lacking proper clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-73 is a large, one story house with a blue roof and yellow trim located in ██████, █████. SCP-73 was built in 1965. The front door is secured and barred with two deadbolts, but it can be opened from the inside. SCP-73 contains various levels of utility rooms and bedrooms, a kitchen and dining room, and two bathrooms.</p><p>SCP-73 exhibits a seemingly anomalous property: Any human being who enters the structure and spends at least 12 hours within it will gain properties corresponding to their age. This effect seems to work regardless of the individual's genetic makeup, as shown by SCP-73's anomalous effects on newborn babies as well as several elderly persons. After one week, the subject would acquire knowledge of all subjects they ever knew, as well as their place in society based upon their age (e.g., elementary school students would come to possess an understanding of high school). In addition, subjects would become familiar with any subjects that have previously resided within SCP-73 and may also meet up with them during their eventual removal from SCP-73, as demonstrated by William ████'s unusual behavior after his removal from the home.</p><p>With further research into this activity, it appears that the following are true:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
