<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-227</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid K</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-227 is to be contained within a standard animal containment chamber located in Site-██. It is to be carried out of its chamber twice daily, and fed from a standard animal feeder. Upon completion of its feeding schedule, SCP-227 is to be returned to containment for sleep time; it should be moved for this time period as little as reasonably possible, so as to prevent any delay in the effectiveness of its sleep.</p><p>No personnel are permitted to enter or interact with SCP-227 outside of its required activities. All interaction should be carried out through recorded video, and official written documentation should take precedence over verbal communication with SCP-227.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-227 is a black domestic short-haired cat, and appears to be genetically slightly different from most attached instances of Felis silvestris, which would suggest that it may be an abnormal lifeform. The extent of its anomalous properties does not appear to have been discovered yet.</p><p>SCP-227 is not sapient; it functions as a normal animal would when left in a normally unaltered state. However, when SCP-227 is left alone in its containment chamber for 24 hours (preferably while asleep), it will undergo a change similar to the process of hibernation, becoming significantly smaller and more insubstantial. This change will persist, with the addition of a layer of subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue, until SCP-227's next feeding session; alternatively, it can be sustained indefinitely by manipulation of sleep patterns imposed on it.</p><p>This 'hibernating' state allows SCP-227 to subsist on much less energy than necessary if given sufficient time in this state; research into possible uses for this ability cannot go ahead until such research has been carried out successfully.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
