<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-427</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-427 is to be kept in a 5m x 3m room in Site 17, with the airlock door being obscured by a wall of standard concrete. The only exit is restricted to Level 4 personnel and above. No staff outside of Containment are to be allowed entry into the room, under any circumstances.</p><p>A camera is to be kept trained on the object at all times. Interaction with SCP-427 during testing requires two or more staff members to be present, except for testing involving high-risk materials or situations which could significantly affect the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-427 is an assemblage of two tangled masses of wires and plastic objects, with a third mass consisting of a keyboard and two translucent green lights on the frame. The object appears to be in the shape of a human being, constructed from wires and lightbulbs which hang in place as if held by wires. No matter how SCP-427 is moved or oriented, it will always appear to display a consistent gender, regardless of biological state.</p><p>Delineation is possible through the use of three sets of eyestalks positioned at various points around the body. Additionally, when SCP-427 is inactive, its framework appears to pulse with a faint purple light similar to that produced by transistors.</p><p>To test SCP-427's responses, press buttons on top left side of keyboard marked 1–0 in order. Hold X down for four seconds to turn on SCP-427's lights.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
