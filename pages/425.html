<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-425</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Every SCP-425-A instance is to be kept in a standard containment unit at Site-77. All units are to operate on atmospheric pressure, and contain an airlock entry point, placed parallel with the floor. An inverse cubic meter vacuum is to be maintained within the containment area, trapping SCP-425-A inside. All areas containing SCP-425-A instances are to be monitored with video cameras at all times.</p><p>In the event of an SCP-425-A instance leaving its containment area, it is to be apprehended as soon as possible and returned to containment, as well as sublimated through an airlock entry before attaining escape velocity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-425-A is a type of subatomic particle known as a "flavor" or "emergent particle".</p><p>SCP-425-A modifies the properties of any material it comes into contact with, causing changes in the chemical composition and physical form of said materials. These modifications are permanent unless reversed by scientific means, and cause each instance of SCP-425-A to possess unique properties which cannot be reproduced.</p><p>The most common physical property possessed by SCP-425-A is to cause any matter it comes in contact with to shrink until being assimilated into its constituent atoms, after which it will disappear. This property can be duplicated by any material in a vacuum, but only through reverse engineering what was originally produced. Standard testing methods such as tunneling, x-ray imaging, and infrared spectroscopy are ineffective at finding SCP-425-A instances in this state.</p><p>SCP-425-A other than those in gaseous form have been observed to exhibit all manner of anomalous processes dependent upon their density. Some examples include:</p><p>The nature of these anomalous phenomena vary depending on the density and form of SCP-425-A. Most anomalous objects are created through splitting into an appropriate number of particles capable of interacting with one another, but nonmaterial instances may also become sentient or undergo structural changes similar to those of living organisms. Below are some examples:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
