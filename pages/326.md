<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-326</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-326 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with all other object classes. SCP-326's cage must be at least 2 meters in length and 1 meter in depth, lined with animal-proofing material. All openings to the cage are to be covered with plexiglass or similar material for the purpose of preventing escapes. A pair of motion detectors are to be placed on opposite ends of the room from the main door, one facing inside and the other facing out. Should SCP-326 enter its containment chamber without permission, an alarm will sound inside the site security office and immediate quarantine procedures will be instituted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-326 is a Caucasian male, measuring 1.8 meters in height. SCP-326 possesses the natural ability to fly, utilizing membrane wings similar to those found on bats. SCP-326's appearance and ability to change between human and bat forms has not been altered by the site's anomalous properties. Subject wears clothing resembling various branches of the military branch of its native country, but varies in color and design with each new form.</p><p>SCP-326 is able to alter its form at will. This ability has been observed in three separate experiments, which have produced differing results in regards to subject's abilities. All tests were performed within the confines of Site-██, with all entrances to the site sealed off from other areas of the Foundation.</p><p>Test Log:</p><p>Subject was able to reproduce one of its forms into an identical specimen as a test using two other similarly sized subjects. The results of this test were inconclusive as no data was collected during testing and in order for the test to succeed, subjects had to be located during their "bat" phase of existence before attempting to return them to their humanoid form.</p><p>NOTE: Subject is currently under Foundation care after having eaten the arm that contained motion detector inside the containment booth that locked it into a room with only one possible exit. Surveillance footage showed subject diving under table after noticing motion detector alerting other personnel present that SCP-326 was in containment room #███. Subject later reemerged from under table and left containment room through door opposite side of containment measures leading back into facility.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
