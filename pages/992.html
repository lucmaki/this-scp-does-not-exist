<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-992</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Harmless.</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-992 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit located in Site-██. SCP-992 should be fed at least once per day by personnel using approved feeding procedures.</p><p>At no time should SCP-992 leave its containment unit. Personnel are to keep SCP-992 in a seated position at all times, and are not to allow SCP-992 to touch the ground. Personnel are reminded that SCP-992 will attempt to escape if it believes it's being abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-992 is a human female, approximately 35 years of age. SCP-992 has been classified as a Level 3 Humanoid Entity by the Foundation, and possesses physical strength equivalent to that of a Category 2 humanoid. SCP-992 is capable of using basic hand-to-hand combat moves against hostile entities, but is unable to perform any other functions with its hands.</p><p>SCP-992 also possesses an accelerated regenerative ability. When injured, SCP-992's damaged limbs or organs are rapidly regrown at a rate of ██% per 24 hours. At this point in time, no one has been able to determine how SCP-992 is able to regenerate tissue; all testing has been halted due to the potential for uncontrollable catastrophic events if the subject is allowed to continue regrowing its body mass at such a rapid rate.</p><p>Should SCP-992 be separated from its containment unit for longer than three (3) days, it will attempt to return once possible. This can take a variety of forms, ranging from simply crawling back into its containment unit to attempting to scale the walls and escape entirely. If SCP-992 cannot accomplish this feat, it will attempt to find a location where it could have possibly escaped and have an emotional breakdown.</p><p>If allowed to roam free by itself or while being left unattended, SCP-992 will attempt accidents on numerous occasions throughout the course of its life. In the past year alone, SCP-992 has caused ██ vehicular accidents totaling ███ deaths, ██ serious injuries, and ██ counts of vehicular manslaughter. All injuries sustained by civilians in these cases were treated and recovered by Foundation personnel before news media were informed about the incident.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
