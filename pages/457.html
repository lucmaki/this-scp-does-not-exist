<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-457</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-457 is contained within a standard containment vault at Site-██. The entrance is to be guarded by two armed guards at all times when the device is in use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-457 is a ground-level containment vault constructed of concrete and steel. The interior of the chamber is lined with several plastic sheets to reduce the effects of the continuous downpour.</p><p>The exterior of SCP-457's chamber is made entirely of an unknown material that functions as a vacuum to keep natural rainfall from reaching the area outside the chamber. Measures have been taken in order to further contain SCP-457's effect via containment seals and radar monitoring, but local populations are unaware that their elevated precipitation comes from within the Foundation facility.</p><p>Continuous use of SCP-457 will cause the precipitation to collect into a dirty, brownish liquid that is reabsorbed by the atmosphere. The torrents produced are roughly consistent with a moderately heavy rainfall, though some reports suggest that higher volumes have been produced.</p><p>SCP-457 makes no indication as to what purpose it serves beyond its anomalous properties. No evidence has been found to suggest that it was built prior to 1940, though portions of it dating from World War II have been last seen in use in 1944. Prior attempts at communication through written characters have proven futile.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
