<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-720</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A single internet-accessible computer is to be maintained on all areas containing SCP-720. Under no circumstances is any attempt to access the "John" and "James" entries of the SCP-720 database to be made. Any changes made to the database by any computer, especially those from within Foundation facilities, is to be logged and monitored.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-720 is an Add/Remove Programs utility for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Installing, uninstalling or changing any software or data on SCP-720 will cause that software or data to disappear from the computer's hard drive and be replaced by a new file with no visible file extension. These files are named "John" or "James".</p><p>A one-time exception occurs if a user enters their username (email address) into the application. This user will then be able to access the services subscribed to them in Outlook Express. If a user changes their email account password, they will receive a message stating that their password has been changed; however, no change will actually take effect until the next time the user opens Outlook Express.</p><p>If a digital image (taken on a camera or otherwise) is uploaded via SCP-720 and saved as a JPEG image file, its filename will also contain "John" or "James". It should be noted that these filenames do not appear in any digital directory, but they may be viewed by computers which have previously accessed SCP-720. In addition, if an email client with the BCC option is used, it will send along information about the file to those recipients listed in their BCC inboxes by altering their email address values; however, no further changes will take place on SCP-720 until another copy of the image is saved.</p><p>It should also be noted that if an image is saved as a PDF document instead of a JPEG, its filename will also contain "John" or "James". This filename does not appear in any PDF directory and can only be viewed by computers which have previously accessed SCP-720.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
