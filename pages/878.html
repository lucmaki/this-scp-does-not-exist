<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-878</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-878 is to be kept in a padded and soundproofed containment locker in Site-71. The floor of this locker should be made of material that is impervious to water, and the locker itself should be constructed out of materials that will not corrode or rust. Containment is to be monitored via closed circuit television. No personnel are to enter SCP-878’s containment area without wearing Goggles equipped with an infrared camera.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-878 is a hollow, approximately 2.6 meter (9.2 foot) tall, rounded cone-shaped structure consisting of black ceramic and steel, which has a diameter of 3 meters (10 feet). SCP-878's base has been carved out to roughly resemble the shape of an octahedron, though it is imperfectly spherical in shape. SCP-878 is hollow on the inside and resembles a cave or crevice with irregular sides. Its exterior curves back inwards towards its apex. SCP-878 was found submerged in ████'s bay during a Foundation investigation into [REDACTED] cases. The previous owner of SCP-878’s previous owner did not provide any information about its origin or function.</p><p>When closed, SCP-878 does not produce any sound despite the fact that it is hollow inside and contains air. However, when open, SCP-878 produces an audible tone that seems to be related to the length of time since the object was closed. Closing the object quickly increases the tone while closing it slowly decreases it almost imperceptibly until stopping completely once the object is fully closed and all air inside has been evacuated by its opening mechanisms; even if open for no more than ten minutes, subjects who have remained within SCP-878 after opening will perceive the tone as constant throughout their entire wait time regardless of how long they wait before opening.</p><p>When opened by hand (including via time dilation), subject’s perception of time within SCP-878 slows dramatically to match their perception speed at rest outside of it; subjects will have estimated about 30 minutes had passed in real time for each minute within SCP-878. The amount of time slowing affected subjects experience correlates directly with the number of occupants active inside the object from this point onward until all occupants are deactivated or leave through whatever means available to them; estimated timings for these measures may vary based on individual experience with this anomaly but are consistent throughout all test groups thus far regardless of subjective perception or specific designation of ‘occupant’.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
