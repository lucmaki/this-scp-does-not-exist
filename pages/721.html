<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-721</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-721 is to be kept in a standard secure SCP object container at Site-66. The existence of SCP-721 and its contents are to be ineligible for inclusion in any Foundation database.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-721 is a cardboard box measuring 5.5×8.3×3.3 cm, containing a solitary (empty) pint glass on one of its sides. SCP-721 is made to resemble a popular brand of Canadian beer.</p><p>All attempts to open SCP-721 have resulted in it self-supporting itself, with no apparent use of anomalous means. Attempts to break open the box have also failed; SCP-721 has proven impervious to any amount of force or damage exerted upon it. A small slit in one side of the box has revealed an ink drawing that features a smiling man standing on a hill overlooking the ocean, with a hand extended toward the viewer and a caption reading "Captured". When tested on other people, this only results in the drawing changing to a single word: "You".</p><p>Should the glass within SCP-721 be emptied when not being observed, and replaced with another empty glass, the image will reappear on the box’s surface. After several days, however, it will vanish until further notice. If filled while being observed, however, the new image will vanish after two days and reform on its own if left alone for another two before appearing again if emptied again.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
