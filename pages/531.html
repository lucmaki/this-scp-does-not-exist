<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-531</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-531 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber, with the door to the chamber left open at all times. The chamber is to be checked for signs of breach at least twice daily by personnel equipped with Level 3 Clearance or higher.</p><p>Any persons attempting to enter SCP-531 are to be detained and questioned. Any persons who are unable to answer one of the following questions posed by the Foundation are not to be permitted entry into SCP-531:</p><p>Person's full name?</p><p>Birth date?</p><p>Age range?</p><p>Current whereabouts?</p><p>Where did you come from?</p><p>Any personnel inside SCP-531 are discouraged from speaking aloud or answering these questions aloud. If a question cannot be answered, the interviewer should direct its attention instead to an object in view that can answer the question. Interviews should last no longer than 30 minutes. All personnel reduced to tears upon entrance into SCP-531 are advised to remain outside the chamber until they have regained enough composure to continue interviewing.</p><p>All persons entering SCP-531 must make sure that their civilian clothing is not visibly altered in any way before entering it. They may not reenter SCP-531 without removing their civilian attire. Civilian attire may be found within SCP-531 if lost or discarded by the subject; details on how this occurs is unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-531 is a large, white room with no discernible entrance or end. Each wall of the room is decorated with a pair of old-fashioned wooden doors. Despite being identical in appearance, each door is engraved with its own name and number:</p><p>Door #1: The Door of Dreams (2/13)</p><p>Door #2: The Door of Torn Dreams (7/24)</p><p>Door #3: The Door of Lost Dreams (10/35)</p><p>Door #4: The Door of Broken Hearts (12/55)</p><p>Door #5: The Door to Everywhere Else (Owner Unknown)</p><p>Each door may only be opened from the opposite side. Individuals who wish to leave SCP-531 may do so by making a request to open one of the doors facing away from them and facing it for at least two minutes. A door will then open and allow access to an area that does not correspond to any place in the world currently known by anyone. This area is referred to as SCP-531-A. Requests within a week of the beginning of a new month are responded to more quickly than requests made during other times. Thus, requests should be made on the first day of the specified month.</p><p>After exiting SCP-531-A, time resumes as normal in SCP-531 and SCP-531-A respectively. No further anomalous properties have been recorded affecting this effect.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
