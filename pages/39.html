<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-39</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-39 is to be contained at a standard, 3 sqm containment cell equipped with a bed, desk and bathroom. Its food intake is to be kept to a minimum due to the fact it displaces vital nutrients from the body into its waste, and only one meal per day is allowed. It is not to be fed any other food types, except for proper hygiene products such as toothbrushes and toothpaste. SCP-39 is to be given 25 minutes of free time daily, which it is free to use in any manner it chooses.</p><p>SCP-39's containment area currently contains 56742 sheets of paper discarded by D-class personnel (see History section for more detail). A collection of approximately 5 documents has emerged as popular reading material among Foundation personnel – including memoranda, notes and reports dating back over 12 years following the creation of this effect.</p><p>Valid images are required to be printed in black ink on white paper. Any printouts containing any other color or shading of ink will cause the same effect as SCP-39's original manifestation. Images printed using devices that employ carbon copies or similar methods may potentially result in the recurrence of SCP-39's effects, particularly where multiple documents are printed out concurrently by several personnel working together.</p><p>SCP-39's containment area is to be maintained to simulate the conditions used when it was first created. The humidity level within its cell should never drop below 62% and the temperature should remain above 22°C at all times. It is also allowed access to a selection of materials from its own personal library (consisting of approximately 6 books) once every week. SCP-39 has expressed a preference for reading scientific texts mainly focused around the fields of psychology and sociology, although members of staff have recommended it reads books on military history, science fiction and philosophy instead.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-39 is a collaborative effort of several inanimate objects, collectively referred to as SCP-39:</p><p>SCP-39's current body resembles a standard office desk, although it is missing one of its legs. SCP-39's head is situated on top of the desk, rotating within a circular frame attached to the object. When active, SCP-39 displays no visible external signs of bodily functions, save for its eyes and mouth.</p><p>All records pertaining to SCP-39 are written within the same style of handwriting, which varies from document to document. It initially appears that SCP-39 has an obvious dislike for writing or reading out loud. However, when recording information onto paper or any other similar material, it will detail multiple ideas and experiments in an attempt to create a final piece of writing. The SCP-39 effect does not manifest until the printout is discarded by the person using paper for their own purposes – whether this is for personal use or research purposes.</p><p>Records concerning SCP-39 prior to 2000 are generally uneventful and do not contain instances of SCP-39's anomalous properties; rather than being written by anyone affected by either the original manifestation or this effect. Early pages are often cluttered with notes regarding everyday issues such as routine maintenance procedures and personnel progress reports, often containing little to no information specific to the research being discussed.</p><p>Printer Friendly: This document can be printed with no changes using common printing methods. However, certain printers (such as color laser printers) may produce different results when attempting to print colored documents containing some kind of shading; in these situations the document should be printed normally, then printed again with a black ink or bleached version of your preferred typeface.</p><p>History: On ██/██/2000, shortly after completing various technical paperwork regarding various research projects at Site ██:</p><p>Dr Addis: So it seems we have access to D Class personnel at the moment. Any idea what we're doing with them? Something about our experiments for behavior testing could affect them in some way… I'm worried about our productivity right now…</p><p>Dr Logan: Yep, seems like we've got our hands full… Only thing that could make this scenario worse would be if they were uncovered… How much longer before they find us?</p><p>Dr Addis: Hopefully never but you never know.. We need some hardcore testing before we can get anywhere near trying out anomalous derivatives of them.. MTFs are already talking about how they'd like a break after all this time… I'm convinced those bastards wanna retire.. "I'm too old for this shit" </p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
