<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-885</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Three Foundation agents, posing as employees of the Caddo Nation institutionalizing the indigenous people of Caddo Village, have been placed in the village to monitor and control the spread of SCP-885.</p><p>SCP-885 is currently contained in a single containment chamber. Only Level 3 personnel may enter this chamber. As of 4/29/19, document SCP-885-1 has become obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-885 is a collection of five wooden buildings situated in Caddo Village, located in the southwestern portion of Oklahoma Territory. Each building is approximately 15m in length, with a single story and three rooms (although the second story has been blocked off). The first room contains a crude kitchen, while two rooms on either side feature sleeping arrangements. The remaining two rooms appear to have been residences prior to SCP-885’s formation.</p><p>SCP-885 produces two primary anomalous effects. Firstly, the villagers living within the village will begin to show signs of slow and painful death until they die. Upon inspection of their corpses, it has been determined that all human corpses within the village had traces of the wood used in construction of the buildings. This wood was found to contain a chemical compound most similar to fentanyl, but far more potent. As for the termination method utilized by SCP-885, no definite answer was given as these people were not subjected to any form of physical force or trauma. It has been noted that every victim died after an illness began spreading from their bodies from the inside outwards. Several victims reported severe abdominal pains before their deaths despite not being shown any signs of physical trauma; doctors have suggested that this pain may have been enough to induce organ failure given its sudden onset.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
