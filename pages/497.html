<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-497</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-497 requires the use of at least two (2) personnel to operate, and is currently contained in a purpose-built containment chamber. The chamber is surrounded by a 20 m electrified fence, and motion detectors are used to detect any unauthorized activity outside the chamber.</p><p>Due to SCP-497's continued movement, it is currently housed in a specially constructed containment lock that can be moved as needed. SCP-497 has been moved multiple times during testing, but a maximum of thirty minutes outside of its original location is currently allowed. Personnel entering SCP-497 are advised to remain at least four (4) meters away from it while inside.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-497 is a device measuring 1.22 m in height, 3.22 m in width, and 7.5 m in length with a total mass of approximately 400 kg. SCP-497 has one large red button on top, marked with a white cross with "Caution: Do Not Push" written below it in all capital letters.</p><p>To date, SCP-497 has undergone no changes or modifications. It was discovered near ████████████████, ████████████ in 1979 as the abandoned project of a secret society known as the SCP Foundation during its early stages of development. Following Foundation personnel discovering it, SCP-497 was contained and moved to Site-77 for research purposes.</p><p>SCP-497 was created by the SCP Foundation in the medium of [REDACTED], a form of communication that allows its recipients to ignore any translation or translation loss affecting their words. The only way current research can show how this is accomplished is through observation, which shows that the medium used is not visible.</p><p>Upon entering [REDACTED], researchers have noted that while most languages have difficulty with [REDACTED], Arabic speakers have demonstrated limited understanding when translating [REDACTED]. There exists an instance where ten (10) Arabic speakers interpreted a conversation between two (2) German speakers as them being Swedish rather than Arabic; however, due to the language barrier between parties at the time, German speakers were unable to verify this either, leading researchers to conclude that [REDACTED] is non-sequitur and therefore impervious to translation loss affecting its recipients.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
