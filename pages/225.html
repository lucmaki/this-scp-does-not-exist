<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-225</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-225 is contained in a standard Safe object locker located in a Class F safe room. Once a month, the container is to be inspected for leakage of any liquid or solid materials that may contain biological items. A change of clothes and sanitary supplies are to be provided once per month to all personnel working inside the immediate vicinity of SCP-225. Contact lenses should not be worn anywhere near SCP-225 at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-225 is a hardcover version of Robert Karlsson's "Yes, Suckers: The Book That Changed Golf" (Golf Digest Books, May 1994).</p><p>SCP-225 can be viewed as an elaboration of the SCP Foundation mythos in that it uses elements of SCP-096 and SCP-079. The book details the efforts of Karlsson, a former professional golfer, to reinvent golf for his colleagues. Most of its pages are filled with an autobiographical account of Karlsson's golf career and the obstacles he faced between 1975 and 1993.</p><p>Whatever liquid or solid material printed on pages 438 to 945 are expelled from SCP-225's pages fairly quickly, given their size.</p><p>Test Log 225a - Attempting to view within lit interior</p><p>Subject: Three D-class personnel</p><p>Object: Generic liter bottle</p><p>Procedure: Subject is given two bottles of water and instructed to read until he feels lightheaded. After three hours and twenty minutes, subject collapses to the ground and is separated from his reading material. He has not regained consciousness since his collapse. Research staff enter the room after six hours without finding anything anomalous.</p><p>Result: Reading material successfully expelled from text at the very moment of collapse.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
