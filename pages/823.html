<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-823</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The object is to be kept in a standard secure containment cell at Site-██, which must be kept at least 15 cm off the ground. A completely sealed chamber of water at least 20 centimetres deep must be available for the safekeeping of the object when not being tested. Testing is to be conducted once per week by D-class personnel under the supervision of at least two Site security staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-823 is a double-leafed 5.5 cm x 3.5 cm black-and-white book with a title written in English, Jay-Mar Codex. The text within the book depicts an image of what appears to be a human hand holding a stylus, accompanied by the words:</p><p>"This part is for the work that you do best. It will help guide your footsteps, as well as protect and guide you on a long journey."</p><p>The inside back cover contains several handwritten notes which appear to be ancient Maya glyphs, but which are unintelligible to all Foundation linguists.</p><p>SCP-823 was recovered from the ████████ dig site during the ██/██/19██ expedition, after reports of an anomalous artifact being unearthed reached Site-██. Of note is the fact that only one item was recovered from the dig site; no additional traces of SCP-823 were found in any other dig sites or locations within a radius of 3km.</p><p>When SCP-823 is taken out of containment, it will engage in communication with an individual who has been designated as a "target," attempting to force them to read aloud its contents through manifesting hostile entities or other natural phenomenon affecting the target's health, mental state or senses. Should the subject attempt to stop reading, or otherwise ignore its instructions, SCP-823 will attempt to physically harm them, either through subjecting them to extreme weather conditions or causing a nearby object to fall directly upon them. Test Log -823</p><p>As long as SCP-823 remains contained in its standard cell, it will not attempt to attack anyone who interacts with the object inside of the cell. Extremely cold weather conditions will cause SCP-823 to abruptly cease communicating with anyone who enters its containment chamber for up to 4 hours at a time; this effect can be negated if D-class personnel are present in the vicinity (see Addendum 823). It is unknown whether cold temperatures have any effect on SCP-823's effects on an individual when they remain outside of its containment chamber.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
