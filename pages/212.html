<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-212</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-212 is to be stored in a standard containment locker, which may be accessed by any D-Class personnel. The object is to be handled only by members of Site 77's research staff, who are to wear special gloves during handling.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-212 is a wooden building mason's trowel, manufactured by D. & G. Russell of London in 1818. The handle and blade combination is identical to that of standard trowels, with the exception of the object's anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-212's anomalous property manifests when an item is inserted into or removed from it, either manually or by use of any kind of mechanical device. Items inserted into SCP-212 will disappear, remaining physically absent from their original location. Removal of the item will have no effect on the anomaly at all; nothing will be missing, the item simply cannot be removed.</p><p>The only known way to prevent an item from being affected by these properties is to insert it into SCP-212 before it can be removed or changed in any way. This requires inserting an absolutely clean and reusable item into SCP-212, as the cleaning and sterilization procedures used on other materials will damage or destroy SCP-212's effects. Testing on items already contaminated by another substance has shown that they are incapable of passing through SCP-212 without harm; even creatures found to be pure antimemetic agents cannot traverse through SCP-212 without at least some degradation of their antimemetic properties.</p><p>Testing on other people has produced no results different than those seen with test subjects: items inserted into SCP-212 disappear upon removal, and neither personnel nor objects appear to retain any physical qualities which are considered abnormal.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
