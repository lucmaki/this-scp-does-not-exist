<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-559</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-559 is to be kept at Bio-Site-56 in a standard humanoid containment room to prevent any escape. The chamber is to contain an air conditioner and have a temperature of 24-25 degrees Celsius as ambient temperature is not important. SCP-559 is to be fed a balanced diet of human grade protein and extra vitamins to sustain itself in its current state. If SCP-559 needs any medical attention, personnel with Level 2 or 3 Clearance may enter the chamber. Any attempts to capture SCP-559 are to be aborted by immediate termination of all involved personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-559 is a human female of approximately 50 years of age.</p><p>SCP-559 possesses no biological functionality, but instead is able to produce, control and distribute SCP-059 through the air in a radius of roughly 20 meters. SCP-059 is capable of maintaining its properties despite being away from the original source and at atmospheric pressure levels. SCP-059 is composed of polyhedral magnesium silicate particles which will adhere to any surface. At 25 degrees Celsius, the density of the particles can be adjusted while they are in suspension by gaseous SCP-059, but this ability degrades as SCP-059 rises in temperature. When SCP-559 is producing SCP-059, it will remain idle unless provoked. The temperature generated by SCP-559's body is not harmful to humans or other organisms which are not made up of carbon compounds; however those organisms are only capable of supporting or propelling themselves against the surface on which they are standing.</p><p>SCP-558 refers to a specific instance in which an individual has been exposed to an uncontrollable amount of SCP-059 that has reached critical mass and caused them to collapse into their own personal universe formed from their own bodily waste products. As these universes created from bodily waste are unable to contain any higher order logic than basic instinctual drive and goal seeking behavior, these universes typically consist of a single place that serves as home for the subject and everything necessary for survival in the universe. These universes vary greatly in size and shape, but most have similar structures in terms of architecture, location and layout. A majority of individuals found inside an SCP-558 instance function as what would be normal life forms within their universe; others seem to have had more significant role within their universe than others.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
