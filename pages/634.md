<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-634</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area of space referred to as the SCP-634 system is to remain off limits to all non-Foundation vessels. Any Foundation vessels found within the SCP-634 system are to be intercepted and confiscated as Class █ hostile vessels. Foundation personnel are to monitor any Foundation discoveries made in the SCP-634 system, and determine which Foundation assets are responsible for the system and remove them from Foundation control.</p><p>The current removal of a possible cultural artifact (see below) is to be postponed pending further investigation by the proper scientific department.</p><p>No other Foundation efforts are to be made to venture into or control territory occupied by SCP-634. Expeditions must be approved by this office, and may only be used for research of anomalous phenomena.</p><p>As per standard containment policy, no live subjects are allowed in or near the SCP-634 system. This includes humans, animals, or inanimate objects. All animal and human test subjects are to be disposed of immediately after testing. Any surviving subjects are to be contained within Site-██ until termination at their own request. A special escape pod has been constructed and stocked with any necessary supplies for this purpose.</p><p>Any information regarding the possibility of an artifact within the SCP-634 system is to be reported at once to this office for review.</p><p>Discovery Log:</p><p>SCP-634 was discovered on ██/██/2011, when a civilian Foundation vessel attempted an unauthorized survey mission within one of its known anomalies (see above). The vessel entered the anomaly and was then subject to a violent manifestation event caused by SCP-634. Most of the crew were destroyed in the short duration of the event, leaving only Dr. Javad Tafreshidashtari alive. Dr. Tafreshidashtari managed to activate emergency protocols before being terminated by a lava eruption caused by a volcanic disturbance within the interior of SCP-634, but not before ejecting himself from his ship with his emergency pod in order to survive the encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-634 is an anomalous system of space comprised primarily of three planets, each at least a match to the Earth in both surface area and mass. All planets are composed entirely of iron, with the exception being one which is composed of iron-silicates. Each planet has an atmosphere which is strongly dependent on the internal source of heat within that planet. Prolonged exposure to atmospheric oxygen can cause humans and animals to suffer from a terrible case of asphyxiation if not appropriately protected.</p><p>During the survey mission, Dr. Tafreshidashtari was able to narrowly escape the lava eruption caused by SCP-634's volcanic activity by ejecting himself into vacuum before death. Upon ejection, Dr Tafreshidashtari's emergency pod used its thrusters to travel over twenty thousand kilometers before splashing into the water near [REDACTED] in the Arctic Ocean (See Discovery Log). Interrogation revealed that Dr. Tafreshidashtari was specifically sent on this mission by his superior, Dr. ██████, due to her belief in the concept of SCP-634's existence. Since then he has been stationed on site when not attending to Foundation activities outside dated for SCP-634 exploration or containment.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
