<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-670</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Containment Grade Fire</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-670 is to be treated as a civilian object and kept in high-security storage. Personnel are to restrict access to testing and Site-17 personnel are not to handle or manipulate any component of SCP-670. All experiment logs for SCP-670 must be reviewed by a member of research staff before the logs are permanently archived. Any component of SCP-670 which is taken from storage for testing must be returned inside of 24 hours, or the subject will become Containment Breach grade and must be terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-670 is a folding Japanese-style tea room table, measuring approximately 50cm x 80cm. The table is comprised of an assortment of variously sized wooden boards and slats which appear to be made out of birch wood. There are four legs at each corner of the table; these also show signs of crude carving in the shape of human hands. Two handtracks extend from the ends on each side, curving upwards and ending at points on the underside of the table.</p><p>SCP-670's anomalous effect manifests once any subject sitting upon it has been completely absorbed into its interior; SCP-670 itself remains unaffected by this effect. All internal components of SCP-670 will change and rearrange themselves to accommodate any subject which is sitting upon it; for example, a human subject sitting upon SCP-670 will cause it to shift around as necessary to make enough space for them to sit down. When an object is completely no longer occupying space inside of SCP-670, whatever has left will be ejected onto a nearby surface at an average speed of 1 m/s. In the majority of cases, when an occupant sits down SCP-670 will change itself to more comfortably accommodate this event. This occurs regardless of whether the occupant is human or not.</p><p>When any group of nonhuman entities tries to use SCP-670 together, they are transported instantly to a single point in time; either before they attempted to sit down onto SCP-670, or as soon as they had finished sitting down, but not beyond. When a group containing more than one type of nonhuman entity such as, for example, multiple humanoids and a large insect individual, attempt to use SCP-670 together, they will be split up and no longer be able to interact with each other.</p><p>In addition to transporting subjects instantaneously outside [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP-670 has the ability to animate objects inside it and cause them to actively move within its interior by animating instances embedded within them. This effect can be observed when an object is removed from SCP-670 while still being animated by it; in these cases standard containment procedures are sufficient to contain instances still within the affected object before it can escape SCP-670's containment. However, if an instance is animated within an object when that object is removed from SCP-670's interior then only the animation will escape along with the object - previously contained instances remain stationary inside SCP- 670 until reanimation by SCP-670 occurs again.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
