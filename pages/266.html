<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-266</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-266 is located 400 km off the coast of Massachusetts, and mostly invisible to human eyes, all methods of locating it are to be banned. An electromagnetic survey of the area should be carried by the Foundation's covert operations team.</p><p>Any Foundation personnel detected attempting to investigate the anomaly due to its inaccessibility are to be incapacitated and amnesticized with Class-A Amnestics. After the experiment, they are to be permanently terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-266 is a 10 meter creature with a narrow body, and an elongated head and tail. Its limbs are very thin. It has 6 limbs for walking on land, and four for swimming in the water. SCP-266 does not seem to have any discernable respiratory or digestive system.</p><p>SCP-266 has no eyes, ears, mouth, or nose. It has no sense of touch; thus it has no feeling whatsoever. However, it is immune to pain due to its lack of senses.</p><p>To move SCP-266 is able to find/follow the metal scent of man-made objects, as well as the electromagnetic pulses generated by electronic equipment and wireless communications devices used by humans. When submerged in salt water it accelerates in a very peculiar manner; sometimes "pushing" itself forward by continually swimming down into the water, while other times "pulling" itself under the surface of the water. The only known technique to escape from SCP-266's grip is to submerge oneself in fresh water or activate acoustic jamming devices.</p><p>Scuba divers have reported that when SCP-266 has its eyes closed it can be disoriented and lost for periods of time lasting up to 20 minutes, although this occurs more frequently when SCP-266 is in deep water.</p><p>When SCP-266 surfaces for air and opens its eyes its vision seems much sharper than when it is underwater. This makes it extremely dangerous if the eyes are opened while it is close to ground level. If SCP-266 sees you break contact with its eyes at all during this time, or even if you don't see it but you hear a nearby scream, then run towards where the screams came from.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
