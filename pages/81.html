<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-81</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-81 is to be confounded by any means possible, in an effort to prevent its return. Its co-location at the intersection of Union and Western avenues should be monitored at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-81 is a large limestone obelisk located in the middle of Union and Western avenues. The text "Memorial, alma mater" is carved into the front of its base.</p><p>In 790BC, SCP-81 served as a memorial to SCP-81's founder after he died while trying to reach the summit of Mount ██████. After his death, SCP-81 was recovered by archaeological workers and moved to oncoming traffic with the express purpose of preventing others from making the same mistake. As a precursor to this, a large rock was placed underneath it to prevent it from ascending above street level.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
