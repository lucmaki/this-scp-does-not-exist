<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-601</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-601 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. While it is possible to disable the unusual properties of SCP-601, only personnel with a high degree of knowledge of computers are to have direct access to it. It is to be logged into once a week, and all entries made in the past week are to be copied for use in testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-601 is a diary with roughly 525 pages. The pages are a computerized version of human handwriting, which on at least one page appears to be decorated with minor alterations such as different fonts and striking through words.</p><p>SCP-601's anomalous properties only manifest when it is (or has been) used to write entries on either computer or paper. It is possible to bookkeep SCP-601 even when the subject is not directly involved with its anomalous properties.</p><p>When an entry is made within SCP-601's scope, it will appear in its original form, complete with handwritten additions underlined and highlighted that may be viewed by anyone else except the person who wrote the entry. In addition, the entry will be written in a style that mimics that of the user, potentially making them difficult to identify or leading them to believe they penned the entry themselves.</p><p>For example, if an Unusual Use Authorization was used by Agent ███████'s desk non-production team to send an email to another member of the project team stating that they had failed a test due to sabotage, someone else would read this information after the email had been sent. However, they would have no idea who actually wrote this message on their end; it would just appear like any other "out of office" message notifying staff of Agent ███████'s absence for an unspecified amount of time for narcotics rehabilitation therapy. This can also be done with other electronic equipment such as phones and computers.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
