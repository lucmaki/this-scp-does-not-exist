<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-351</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area around the wreckage of SCP-351 has been cleared, and the local population is to be given amnestics should they wish to forget this incident.</p><p>Warnings must be given to pilots and air traffic control agents of airspace near the crash site not to cross over SCP-351 at any altitude unless authorised by Level 3 personnel. Any mappings of SCP-351 present on charts, maps or other navigational aides are hereby deemed temporarily lost and replaced with the new SCP-351 location.</p><p>Recovery Site-942 has been setup to receive any human remains and personal effects from SCP-351. All bodies recovered from SCP-351 are to be taken for examination, where their bodily fluids and tissues are to be collected for further analysis and testing. Human remains are also to be fitted with recording devices in order to preserve as much information as possible regarding these people. No living human remains shall be returned to the families of those individuals lost. This duty is hereby assigned to Researcher Wenjian Song.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-351 is the wreckage of a Russian Tu-95 'Bear' bomber, located at ███°N, ███°E. SCP-351 exhibits no anomalous properties when viewed from the air or from the ground. When viewed from any other perspective, however, it becomes visible as a small wreckage on the ground. When one approaches SCP-351 closer than 1.5 km, they will not be able to see any characteristics of SCP-351 except for the fact that it is a single small piece of aircraft metal on the ground in front of them. At this point, all observers will be unable to perceive SCP-351 as anything else than a piece of metal when viewed in any other way by themselves.</p><p>Observers will continue to report seeing an aircraft while they are getting closer to the wreckage, and they will behave in a way that suggests that they believed they were getting closer to something resembling an airplane due to their belief alone. However, after a certain distance has been reached (currently unknown), all observers will begin to lose sight of SCP-351 and report that it is not present anymore. Based on recovery after loss of visual contact with SCP-351, it seems that people willing or unwilling see what they want to see and fail to perceive SCP-351's true nature until too close.</p><p>This phenomenon may take place over a period of several minutes if one is not vigilant enough. If another person comes within 0.5 km of SCP-351 at this time, his or her perception of SCP-351 will slowly switch from first seeing it as an intact airplane to seeing it as "cobwebs". The base idea is that since there is no proof that SCP-351 has been hit by enemy fire or damaged by its own crew before being abandoned after crashing on the ground, whenever someone gets close enough for him/herself to see this part of the wreck, s/he will start making assumptions about its condition and what happened before its abandonment.</p><p>If there are no other witnesses for this phenomenon except for the subject who approached towards SCP-351 then he/she will also describe what he/she thought happened based on their previous experience with planes which have been shot down by enemy fire or crash during wartime missions using aircraft carriers and fighter jets as escorts.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
