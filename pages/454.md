<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-454</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Local police are to be notified that any people under the age of 19 are not allowed to enter SCP-454, and that if SCP-454 does not remain dry and functional, at least one policeman should be stationed around SCP-454.</p><p>The United Nations Office of Paranormal Affairs has been assigned as the custodian of SCP-454. They are not allowed to remove any items from SCP-454 without explicit permission from the Director of OPA, or their superior.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-454 is a dock with a wooden pier attached to it, located on the side of the West Side Highway in New York City, at approximately 0.8m x 0.8m. The pier appears to have been constructed out of wood and has several planks, which are individually solid and appear to be made of teak wood. The area around the pier has been permanently enclosed by white PVC piping, duct tape, and several chains of varying strength, which prevent people from stepping into SCP-454.</p><p>Anyone who attempts to step into SCP-454 will either experience severe physical pain or become unable to move; if people entering SCP-454 attempt to walk off the pier, they will immediately fall backwards into the water below and drown. Should someone successfully step onto SCP-454's pier (excluding D-class personnel), they will be transported via unknown means to an area in the basement of Staten Island Homegoing Fairgrounds, where they will be found clothed in tattered clothing similar to what they were wearing when transported away from their initial location.</p><p>The furniture in this small basement room is rusted, warped and missing its paint. A single light bulb burned brightly when first discovered, but quickly burnt out due to lack of electrical power. Door handles are usually found broken or missing, forcing individuals to open the doors using some sort of reinforced opening mechanism or brute force. Sometimes these mechanisms actually work and open up various parts of SCP-454's interior.</p><p>D-Class personnel are not affected by SCP-454 after becoming familiar with it; personnel who have been rejected from testing with SCP-454 (with no explanation given) may still be able to enter it after rejoining the Foundation and spending time around the anomaly; MTF Tango Bravo was lost near SCP-454 during testing. Personnel must have permission from at least one Level 3 Clearance Supervisor before entering SCP-455; all DMs must have at least seven Foundation personnel accompanying them when entering a new area that is around 100m from SCP-454 until they are granted official lab clearance for testing with said area.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
