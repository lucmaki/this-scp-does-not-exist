<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-384</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Extensive Foundation monitoring of the site of SCP-384's disappearance must be maintained, as well as its current location. The site is to be guarded by the regular rotation of between two and four Foundation agents on 24 hour shifts.</p><p>No person or group may gain access to SCP-384's location without direct authorization from one of the Site Directors. Any person entering into close proximity of an instance of SCP-384 must immediately be dealt with by authorized research personnel and then disposed of by incineration. If this fails, amnestic treatment may be given, depending upon the severity of exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-384 is a cube of unknown composition and origin, and measures 1m x 1m x 1m in dimensions. Instances of SCP-384 are mobile and have the ability to propel themselves in any direction through water at speeds up to 1000km/h. As of 20██, no means of discerning the purpose or method of movement by SCP-384 instances has been determined.</p><p>Should an individual come into contact with an instance of SCP-384, they will be transported to a location within approximately 30 seconds. The distance traveled will vary based upon factors such as distance traveled, amount of water displaced, temperature, etc. In addition, this will occur without respite for an entire 24 hours within 72 hours after first contact.</p><p>The only locations which SCP-384 does not transport a subject to are those inhabited by humans. At this time it is unknown why these dwellings have prevented SCP-384 from moving within them. It is currently theorized that SCP-384 may be responsible for transporting a human being to another world and/or time period if they were transported too close to a human residence. Due to this reason, Foundation personnel are advised to wear waterproof clothing when performing outdoor tasks in order to avoid getting close enough to individual instances of SCP-384.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
