<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-987</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-987 is to be kept in a high security storage locker. The locker is to be kept locked and only authorized personnel are allowed entry. The locker's contents are to be cleaned once per month and any items removed are to be kept under guard until destroyed.</p><p>Any attempted experimentation on SCP-987 is not to be carried out without permission of the current researcher.</p><p>As a long-term containment measure, SCP-987 has been embedded with a radio transmitter that broadcasts a signal at a low power level that can only be detected by the wearer. Attempts to locate the source of this signal have been unsuccessful, but it has been determined that wearers will cease wearing SCP-987 if they find the signal.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-987 is a pair of designer sunglasses. Upon close examination, the lenses are not made of glass, but appear to be a combination of plastic and reflective metal. The frame appears to have been scraped off of a pair of sunglasses that had been damaged during transportation, and was reattached with epoxy glue. The lens work is not only completely visible through SCP-987, but also reflects light at an unusual angle.</p><p>SCP-987 does not react in any way when tested on human subjects, instead appearing to be empty. However, when SCP-987 is worn by an animal subject, it becomes a form of communication device that allows the wearer to speak through its lenses. Attempts to trace the signal or learn how SCP-987 works have been unsuccessful.</p><p>Subjects wearing SCP-987 report feeling a strange sensation as if they were speaking with someone, although no such individual has been identified. Subjects wearing SCP-987 will also feel emotions directly from the subject wearing SCP-987 and will be able to detect other entities within one meter range. Subjects wearing SCP-987 will often describe a sense of calm if they wear it in the presence of other subjects.</p><p>When a suitable subject (one who can be regarded as possessing sentience) is located, the wearer may make a request using voice recognition software (see Addendum) This request will take approximately two minutes to process and the requestor may choose to interact with either themselves or another entity through voice command (see Addendum). If they choose to interact with themselves, they will see their own face reflected in SCP-987's lens and describe feeling like they were in physical contact with themselves. If they choose another entity, they will be able to communicate via speech for about one minute (see Addendum).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
