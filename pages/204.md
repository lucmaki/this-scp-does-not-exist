<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-204</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation maintains a cover identity for SCP-204, "Marriott's". Contact with this organization is not permitted. Any information gained from the Foundation is to be exchanged with the Marriott's personnel in person and on paper only. In the event of accidental exposure, class 4 amnestics are to be administered before any efforts to conceal knowledge of SCP-204 from the public eye may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-204 is a set of twelve adult human males, designated SCP-204-A through SCP-204-I. To date, SCP-204 have been discovered in postal facilities throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The names on the front of the individuals' identification cards match their vocal experience. A recorded audio cassette tape is always located within the mail (postmarked from ████, NY and labeled "SECRET"). The attached cover note bears no address and requests that the recipient call them when they arrive.</p><p>When a human male adheres to one of these criteria, he will receive a phone call from an identifying voice matching his vocal experience. They will then proceed to follow all normal procedures for a hotel guest and order anything that has not already been taken care of by the Marriott's staff. Everything will be delivered to their room, regardless of whether it is requested or not.</p><p>SCP-204 have been known to leave their hotel rooms periodically throughout the duration of their stay in order to complete other tasks at request of the caller, such as delivering packages to others and checking in on maintenance workers who are securing an area while they are out. Each individual with whom they have interacted has shown interest in their presence and will leave them with a copy of a book entitled "The Twelve Part Harmony". This book is written by [DATA EXPUNGED], a person who resides within the confines of SCP-204's containment unit.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
