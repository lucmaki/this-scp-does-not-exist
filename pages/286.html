<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-286</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-286 is surrounded by a perimeter fence 50 m (164 ft) in length and the internal cavity is filled with concrete. The area of the containment chamber containing SCP-286 can be accessed via elevator at the base of the containment shaft. Area 1 contains the entrance to SCP-286 and Area 2 is designated for extra security measures.</p><p>All reports of trespassers or unauthorized access to SCP-286 are investigated by Foundation personnel stationed at Area 2. Any unauthorized trespassing gets immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-286 is a humanoid male, approximately 1.75 m (5 ft) tall and weighing 50 kg (110 lb). SCP-286 wears a gray suit with brown shoes, black vest and tie and a fedora hat. Despite the commonly accepted belief of SCP-286's physical location, it is unknown where SCP-286 is in terms of space.</p><p>If an individual approaches SCP-286 and greets it, one of more following effects will occur:</p><p>SCP-286 suffers no adverse effects from these interactions, but refuses to answer questions regarding its origins or purpose. If the individual attempts any form of harm to SCP-286 during this process, it will refuse to continue the interaction for three days. During this period, SCP-286 will attempt to find the individual trespassing on its property.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
