<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-41</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-41 is kept in a specially constructed reinforced metal box and stored in Site-31's anomalous item vault. It is to be handled with care while being transported to and from its containment unit, as it has been known to [DATA EXPUNGED] when stressed or moved too forcefully. Any personnel who are affected by SCP-41 are to be terminated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-41 is an "anomaly", a fluctuation in physics. Despite its anomalous nature, SCP-41 is currently the single most popular item among Foundation personnel, second only to the members of Task Force Upsilon. This is because all personnel tend to enjoy puzzles and the challenge of working with a particularly bizarre item.</p><p>SCP-41 has certain effects on scientists who handle it, similar to an amphetamine. If handled carefully by a trained technician, SCP-41 can be used to enhance their ability to think and reason, allowing them to solve complex mathematical problems which would otherwise be impossible for them to see through or comprehend. This effect disappears if the user does not handle SCP-41 for over five hours, or if they are distracted from it.</p><p>Although temporarily enhanced intellectual capacity is not considered harmful at this time, using SCP-41 in any way besides its intended purpose will result in blurred vision and extreme auditory hallucinations. The active ingredients within SCP-41 cause these effects, most likely as a result of being constantly combined or combined with other chemicals over time. In order for research teams and technicians to continue handling SCP-41 without suffering these effects, amnestics are available on request.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
