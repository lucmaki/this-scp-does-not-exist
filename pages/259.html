<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-259</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-259 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-77. It is to be equipped with a video camera and microphone, both of which are to be mounted outside of its iron boundaries. Any personnel approaching SCP-259 are to be informed that it has "do not touch" written in large letters on its side. At no time is it to be opened or removed from its enclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-259 is a standard human hand, of average size and weight. It cannot move freely, but it can hold small or heavy objects. It can be opened or closed without fail, even while SCP-259 is not being observed. SCP-259 can also function as a remote control for various electronic devices within its range, up to a distance of six meters. SCP-259 was found in █████████████ ████, United Kingdom, at the house of █████ ██████, who lived alone. [DATA EXPUNGED]</p><p>When using SCP-259 as a remote control, there are no recorded instances of SCP-259's remote being used while not directly controlled by an individual's hands. When this remote control is used by an outside party (one known to have seen the instant in which the device starts to work), any recorded instances of the use of said device cease. When an outside party uses their own hands as remote controls for the item, all instances continue.</p><p>SCP-259 does not appear to have any effect on electronic devices that do not require the use of hands to operate. The affects that it has upon electronics seem to vary with the person using it, ranging from them disappearing completely[1], to making the device explode[2], setting it on fire[3], or simply making it go dead[4]. SCP-259's current primary effect is to allow non-anomalous individuals to operate complex machines with ease. This appears to be very difficult for non-anomalous individuals; most tests have shown that only 5% of such people are able to do so. Testing on D-Class personnel has shown a 90% success rate for this operation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
