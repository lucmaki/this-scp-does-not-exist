<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-936</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-936 is to be kept in a secure storage locker located within the Site-17 library. A copy of the book "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" is to be kept within this facility as well. Any Foundation personnel handling these objects are to be briefed on the nature of their anomalous properties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-936 is a black unlined leather-bound book measuring approximately 10 cm x 14 cm in size. The title of the book is "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz". It is written in English, with an unknown author listed as "A Wizard". The book contains a picture on its cover depicting a young girl wearing a red dress, holding onto a large house. A caption appears below the image stating, "A wonderful wizard and his lovely wife live in this house. They're always very kind and helpful to their friends." This picture has been blurred out, with three blank pages appearing between the front and back covers.</p><p>When opened, the book will contain an excerpt from "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", where the initial paragraph opens up to show a young girl sitting by herself, playing on a green-colored playground equipment. The following paragraph describes her playing on this equipment and becoming worried over being stuck in one place while trying to enjoy herself. A footnote appears in the center of the page stating that it was written by "The Kitten", who was later revealed to be SCP-936.</p><p>When read through normally, the excerpt will continue until an end has been reached. Due to its anomalous properties, the book can be read backwards or forwards through time as desired by the reader. Though each reader will have their own experience according to body movements, words stored within SCP-936 are uniform when read through.</p><p>If read through backwards or forwards however, readers will instead begin watching their actions repeat themselves for hours upon hours before ending up back at their original point in time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
