<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-178</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-178 is to be contained in a high security storage unit at Site ██. Containment is to include both a steel enclosure and hand-holding by two (2) Level 3 Agents at all times. Any breach of containment is to be treated as a potential biological contagion.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-178 is a large male orange tabby with the appearance of a storm cloud. SCP-178 moves and behaves in a manner resembling a "manic depression." SCP-178 dislikes being physically restrained and will attempt to undo any restraints placed on it. When contained, SCP-178 appears to be very content and sometimes wanders away from containment.</p><p>Any contact with SCP-178 causes an overpowering feeling of depression, despair, isolation and loneliness. Subjects report feeling as if they have been forgotten by and abandoned by others. This effect is proportional to the amount of time spent in physical contact with SCP-178.</p><p>When subjects are not influenced by the memories of those contained within SCP-178, they will focus on themselves and their hardships. However, when exposed to the memories of those who have previously entered SCP-178 (an effect dubbed "amnesia"), all subjects report a sudden and complete remission of self-pity. They will then become highly loyal and protective of those they had been affected by while inside SCP-178.</p><p>Subjects within SCP-178 will defend said persons until their deaths or until all known individuals are contained within the object. Another effect, dubbed "grief engendered rage", has been observed when a subject is exposed to memories of persons who have died while inside or outside of SCP-178.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
