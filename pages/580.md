<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-580</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-580 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with a human suicide prevention device. The device is to be removed and cleaned in order to avoid any potential complications from SCP-580's effect on the human body. SCP-580 may be handled only by Class-D personnel who are under the influence of anti-anxiety medication, due to the adverse effects of SCP-580 on those already prone to stress. If it is necessary for testing, staff members must always be wearing full protective equipment during their interactions with SCP-580.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-580 is a black obsidian stone similar to a cat's eye. The surface of SCP-580 is unmarked, with no signs of erosion or weathering. The item does not appear to respond to the human touch, but to be more resistant than mineralized items of the same composition. It is 20 cm long and 8 cm across at its widest point.</p><p>When touched by a human, SCP-580 will begin to emit a bright red glow, pulsating in intensity and frequency. This effect will continue indefinitely as long as the item is held by the affected individual. This effect also appears to be universal in terms of gender and ethnicity; all humans who have handled SCP-580 will exhibit this effect. If a person attempts to withdraw their hand from SCP-580, the glow intensifies and will continue until the hand makes physical contact with the item again. However, if the affected individual passes out or dies, the effect will immediately cease.</p><p>The effects of SCP-580 can be reversed by exposing it to sunlight for 15 seconds. Exposure to sunlight for longer than this will permanently alter SCP-580's properties; further testing has thus far not been possible due to these results.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
