<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-298</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-298 is to be contained in a locked safe within the Foundation's on-site research lab. SCP-298's location within the lab is to remain classified below level 5 clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-298 is a bronze key measuring 70 mm x 50 mm. It is inscribed with an ancient Sumerian symbol (designated SCP-298-A), and is of undetermined origin. The Basra Museum of Antiquities claims that the previously documented locations of SCP-298 had been lost to war prior to their acquisition.</p><p>To date, SCP-298 has not shown any anomalous properties until its activation. Once activated, SCP-298 will begin to bore into materials within a 5 meter radius through both natural and artificial means. The rate of progress is proportional to the amount or density of matter surrounding SCP-298; however, once the key's "target" location has been reached, SCP-298 ceases all current bores and remains stationary in that location until triggered again.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
