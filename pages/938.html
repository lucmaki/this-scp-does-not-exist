<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-938</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-938 is to be kept in a large containment chamber in Storage Bay 5, with no less than twenty (20) security personnel present at all times. A room with a large air vent has been created for the vessel's use. SCP-938's appearance and location are to be kept from any persons outside of Foundation personnel who have been exposed to it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-938 is an abandoned vessel of unknown origin, constructed out of wood and metal. The "Black Pearl" was built in ████ after the downfall of the █████pirate fleet. It has been in storage at Site 17 since it was seized during a Foundation raid on ████.</p><p>SCP-938 weighs approximately 8,000 pounds, or 500 tonnes. Changes in its mass are consistent with movement within the space of the vessel. The ship is composed of a large central room accessible via numerous hatches on all sides, as well as two smaller rooms in front of this room and one large one behind. Each hatch has a handle which can be turned to open or close their respective door; no levers or other means of opening the hatches have been found within SCP-938.</p><p>A small group of what appears to be ghostly sailors can be observed aboard the "Black Pearl." These sailors animate themselves when they are spotted and will attempt to gather around observers who are onboard SCP-938. No attempts have been made at communication with any of these sailors by Foundation personnel and all attempts have failed as they pass through the objects internal dimensions.</p><p>The interior of SCP-938 appears to be empty, but high concentrations of smoke will occasionally emerge from openings in the walls. No source for these smokes has been determined, though high levels of sulfuric acid have been recorded at various points throughout SCP-938's interior.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
