<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-167</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-167 is to be kept in a containment locker at Site-19. No electronic devices are to be allowed within 10 cm of the containment area. Personnel entering the testing chamber should keep their phones completely powered off and placed in a sealed metal container at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-167 is a shaped like a large silver question mark, with numerous round holes on the surface. It can be up to 7 cm in diameter and 12 cm long, with a depth of 4 to 6 cm. The object has no base or handle. Once SCP-167 is placed on an electronic device, it will begin to affect the device by electronically stimulating all functions as if they were being performed by the human brain. This process begins as soon as 20 minutes after SCP-167 comes into contact with the device and continues until it has been removed from the device.</p><p>Once SCP-167 has affected one electronic device, it will move randomly around the facility until it causes another electronic device to malfunction. When two devices are affected at the same time, they may interact in a manner dependent on their positions and their general design. For example, if a sound playing device is within 10 cm of both devices simultaneously, when discovered playing music will cause them both to malfunction as well as becoming louder than before and possibly altering the behavior of other devices in their path. This phenomenon will continue until more devices have been affected by SCP-167 or it itself is removed from the facility; however, in rare cases this effect can be limited by proximity to an intelligent subject. If a group therapy session is scheduled with Foundation personnel, each individual that enters the testing chamber must be accompanied by another subject of their choosing who does not exhibit any anomalies themselves.</p><p>If an object has been affected by SCP-167 for more than ten hours consecutively, it will begin malfunctioning more frequently, sometimes even causing its own destruction. During these times subjects of SCP-167's current affect will become agitated and violent towards other subjects using improvised weapons such as chairs and stones while attempting to remove them from their bodies. Subjects may also engage in cannibalism due to hunger and boredom when this occurs.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
