<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-463</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-463 must be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. The interior of the containment cell is to be covered with steel and concrete. SCP-463 may be permitted to eat once per week since it requires no sustenance. Standard Humanoid psychological testing is required for SCP-463.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-463 is a male human with long red hair and blue eyes. SCP-463 appears to be 27 years of age in its natural state, although any records of this individual have been expunged from the historical record.</p><p>SCP-463 will attempt to escape from its containment cell approximately once per week, sometimes attempting to use means for escape not available to it. SCP-463 will immediately cease activity if it is forcibly removed from its cell.</p><p>SCP-463 can communicate with humans by means of telepathy. When this occurs, SCP-463 will display the following personality and behavior pattern:</p><p>When interacting with humans, SCP-463 will attempt to persuade them to cooperate in the goals it has set for itself. In order to accomplish these goals, SCP-463 will attempt to convince the humans that they are acting irrationally, and that they need not be concerned with the modern world.</p><p>Should a human refuse or fail to cooperate with SCP-463, it will attempt to convince the people involved that they are going insane and need psychiatric care. These attempts are entirely successful; thus far all attempts by SCP-463 to persuade this group of humans have succeeded in their goal of being given psychotherapy and medication. After undergoing therapy and/or medication, these humans exhibit completely normal behavior until they leave their home base and are then replaced by new subjects for SCP-463.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
