<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-96</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-96 is secured in a standard containment locker at Site-23. A heating pad is to be provided to SCP-96 during the night.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-96 is a medium-sized dog, approximately six years old and weighing 76 kg. SCP-96 is able to use its body to generate extremely high temperatures. No known material or method of insulation has been able to stop SCP-96 from being capable of sustaining temperatures in excess of 1,100 C. SCP-96 appears to have a preference for mainly warm and/or damp areas, which are typically located in or around the confines of large buildings such as hotels and office complexes.</p><p>SCP-96’s preferred manner of movement while in containment is bipedal with an average speed of 7 km/h. SCP-96 is only capable of maintaining a sustained temperature of 1000 C when moving at this speed, and will cease after 3 minutes if not stopped. SCP-96 is incapable of sustaining this temperature indefinitely in its current containment environment, requiring extra heating equipment to be provided on a daily basis.</p><p>When SCP-96 enters a relatively warm building, it will begin walking across the interior until it reaches an area that it regards as suitable for its needs; usually, this involves a number of rooms off the main hallway such as guest bedrooms or employee lounge spaces. Once satisfied with its surroundings, SCP-96 will begin pacing back and forth inside the room repeatedly walking away from (and then back towards) the door in search for more suitable spaces to move around in for extended periods of time. This behavior can result in damage to both the interior and exterior of the building if not properly contained.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
