<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-101</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-101 is to be contained in a 1m x 2m x 5m enclosure of reinforced concrete. A 5 square meter area of soil shall be maintained through the entirety of SCP-101's containment, to aid with its natural behaviors. SCP-101 shall only be fed on the excess soil when it exhibits anomalous behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-101 is an anomalous evolutionary variant of a human fetus. At the point where a human fetus is 3-5 weeks old, SCP-101 has embarked on its life as a human. SCP-101 will experience all developmental stages of human gestation at this point, albeit in much shorter periods of time.</p><p>Although it is composed entirely of various minerals and genes that would normally be present in a normal human fetus, it possesses several features which mark it out as anomalous.</p><p>Unlike other entities which enter a dormant state at birth, SCP-101 is active and vocal throughout its entire life cycle, and exhibits most of the behaviors associated with humans in their early stages.</p><p>SCP-101 appears to possess a biological imperative to only engage in normal activity for the purposes of feeding and clothing itself; any activities outside these parameters are ignored by SCP-101, save for its anomalous development.</p><p>Interviewed: SCP-101 (designated 101)</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ██████</p><p>Foreword: 101 was brought into Foundation custody 2 years after knowledge of its existence became widely known. It claimed ownership of several properties throughout Europe, although no individuals or entities have come forward to confirm its claims. 101 refused to comment on the origins or nature of its anomalous properties at the time of containment.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr. ██████: Thank you for agreeing to speak with us, 101. I'm going to ask you some questions about your anomalous properties and why you're here now. Is there anything you wish to add?</p><p>101: Yes, I'm very happy to be here now. I've been missing my mother for nearly 17 years now! [several seconds pass] My leg doesn't hurt anymore since we've been talking! That was also very nice! [laughs quietly]</p><p>Dr. ██████: All right, please go on…</p><p>101: I would like to request that you call me "Mother" from now on… I don't mind if you address me that way!</p><p>Dr. ██████: That's fine by me, thank you. All right then, do you have any questions?</p><p>101: Could I live as an adult? [another 15 seconds pass] No offense intended! But how long can someone who looks like me live? And please answer my question before I die again! Can you answer it? [several seconds pass] Why did they want me dead? [pause followed by sobbing] Please… not again… [breaks down] Not again… why did they do that? Why couldn't they want me alive? [sobs] Why? Why didn't they want me alive?! [sobs continue for an estimated ten minutes before subsiding.] Oh Mother…</p><p>Dr. ██████: To reply to your question, 101; we believe that there is no way that anyone could sustain your condition indefinitely due to the enormous amount of energy required for ongoing cellular regeneration, metabolism and even continued physical activities required for survival. If we were able to provide protective housing for you indefinitely until such time as your condition ceased naturally, we would be more than happy to do so regardless of the negative public relations fallout from our decisions. Your inclusion into our custody is non-negotiable; providing us with a way for you to survive indefinitely would take place regardless of whether or not we could afford the risks involved in protecting you indefinitely. Do you understand what I'm saying?</p><p>101: Yes… yes I understand everything perfectly fine! As long as I'm able to live long enough without dying… that's all I care about right now! Just as long as Mama isn't hurting anymore… please don't send me back there again! Ohh God please God let me stay here… here with you people! Even if I don't deserve it, just give me one chance… no matter what anybody thinks… let me stay here just once more! Please please let me stay here JUST ONCE MORE!!! <End Log></p><p>Closing Statement: 101's condition stabilized shortly thereafter.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
