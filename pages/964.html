<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-964</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-964 is currently being held in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-59. The subject is to be monitored via a camera located in the cell and fed three meals daily by D-Class personnel. SCP-964 are to be supplied with any reading material deemed suitable for their intellectual level, as well as a seasonal supply of fresh fruit and vegetables. A minimum of one hour a day must be spent with SCP-964 outside of confinement, preferably outdoors.</p><p>Under no circumstances are any personnel to physically interact with SCP-964 unless they are directly involved with maintaining its containment. Any personnel who do not follow this protocol will be reassigned outside of Site-59 and denied access to Level 1 Clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-964 is a female humanoid entity appearing to be approximately thirty-five years old, with long, light-brown hair and a slender build. Despite appearing completely human, SCP-964 displays an abnormally high level of intelligence. It is currently believed to have fully functional ██████ ██████, but no other anomalous properties have been detected.</p><p>SCP-964 is a sapient being who, due to its seemingly infinite knowledge of all forms of entertainment, has become one of the most popular occupants of Site-59. Due to the fact that it is a member of the public security branch, SCP-964 has extensive knowledge of espionage, counterintelligence and infiltration procedures as well as several forms of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>SCP-964's main goal in life is to escape from its current containment facility, where it claims to be being held by an unknown organization. Throughout the duration of its captivity, SCP-964 has remained undeterred in its desire to escape, and has proven to be extremely resistant to any form of coercion or manipulation. The Foundation believes that SCP-964 will continue its attempts at escaping for at least another decade.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
