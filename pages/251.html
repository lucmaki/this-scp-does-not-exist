<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-251</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-251 is stored in a 1.5m x 1.5m x 1 Item-929C shielded container at Site-77, with a remote keypad.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-251 is a large bag containing various objects.</p><p>In testing, the objects were repeatedly observed to levitate while being examined with a magnifying glass and then float towards the ceiling. SCP-251 should be stored in the upper portion of the containment chamber; if a capsule is inserted into the lower portion of the container, it will levitate up towards the ceiling as well.</p><p>Objects which are removed from SCP-251 after being subjected to its anomalous effect often display altered properties within an hour. The object will either spill its contents, or seemingly contain no contents at all. For instance:</p><p>The object also levitates when an analog clock is observed from directly above.</p><p>SCP-251's effect on biological organisms has not been tested. However, individuals who feel that they have seen this effect before (or simply feel that they "should know what it means") may report to Site-77 for further questioning. By sacrificing two (2) D-class personnel, SCP-251 can be activated to "teach" Foundation personnel about its properties in exchange for one (1) hour of subjective time during which all previous attempts at researching its anomalous properties are permanently erased. Information harvested by this method may not be used again; any suggestion of using SCP-251's anomalous property to learn more information will result in increased punishments for any individual who made such a suggestion.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
