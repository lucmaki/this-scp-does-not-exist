<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-499</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid (see</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-499 is deactivated and kept in a lockbox in the Antique Safe in Site-55's office at all times. All personnel assigned to SCP-499 are required to have been assigned to the Human Resources Department of Site-55 at least 1 year prior to assignment, due to the danger inherent in the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-499 is a vintage Parker "Cupid" ballpoint pen, model #92. The object was manufactured in 1947. SCP-499 exhibits no anomalous properties when inactive; however, it can be used to write non-digital messages by placing the ink cartridge back into the pen (SCP-499 will not function if removed from the tube). In any case, this mode of usage will fail if SCP-499 is inserted into a computer, as it will cease all electrical activity at that time. Despite the fact that SCP-499 is completely useless on its own, it is apparently very popular with young children, who write large amounts of "poems" on their bodies or in their play environment using this item.</p><p>Test 499A: D-Class Dory ████████ writes the following message on her left arm:</p><p>"Do you believe in monsters? Do you believe in love? I do."</p><p></p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
