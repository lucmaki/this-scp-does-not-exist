<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-905</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-905 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. It is prohibited from communicating with any other subjects. Any subjects attempting to do so are to be forcibly removed from the chamber by security personnel. To prevent possible interactions with other objects, SCP-905 is to remain seated at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-905 is a male human, approximately 18 years of age. At no point in its life has it been implanted with any form of prosthetic device. Hair samples taken from the subject have proven consistent with DNA sampling taken from the subject's maternal grandmother, and similar DNA profiles have been identified with other members of its family. At no point in its life has SCP-905 demonstrated any unusual qualities or capabilities; all testing has failed to produce anomalous results.</p><p>According to interviews and documents, SCP-905 was found on a street corner attempting suicide by ingestion of phenobarbital after being expelled from an unnamed religious organization. SCP-905 was rescued by members of the Foundation following this event and taken into custody. Containment procedures were developed based on interviews conducted at the time of apprehension.</p><p>SCP-905 speaks fluently in both English and Spanish and has no accent or difficulty pronouncing items unless the subject is desperate to speak. The subjects intelligence level has been matched to that of a senior high school student. In addition to writing on paper, SCP-905 can also vocalize decoded information using either writing or speech (see Interviews).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
