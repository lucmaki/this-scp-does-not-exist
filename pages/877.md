<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-877</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-877's recording equipment and instruments are stored in a lock-free storage unit at Site 36. Personnel entering the storage unit must wear ear protectors, and be kept at least 6 meters away from any part of the storage unit at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-877 was originally a civilian emergency response unit in the city of Changsha, China. All members of SCP-877 have since died of natural causes or otherwise disappeared, their bodies now having been cremated and disposed of in accordance with Chinese law.</p><p>Since it was first found, SCP-877 has been recorded at various locations in the United States, where the band still performs at locations on the East Coast. The song "Bomb Squad" is part of SCP-877's repertoire.</p><p>SCP-877 does not appear to require sleep or rest, instead recharging its instruments at night by itself. When not performing music, SCP-877 appears to be perfectly normal human beings, though it will usually wander around during the night leading investigators to believe that it has no preset destination.</p><p>SCP-877 will often randomly stop performing during performances and will begin "jamming" with other individuals. It may also sit down on the ground for extended periods of time and will sometimes place a microphone in front of itself and begin singing along to its own music for prolonged periods of time without any discernable pattern. When performing with others, SCP-877 will sometimes take on various roles within their performance. It will play drums when others are playing guitar, sings while others are singing bass or keyboards, and may even play multiple instruments at once. Some performers appear unable to tell what is happening as they are under the effect of SCP-877's effects. During performances, SCP-877 is susceptible to loud noises and can be injured if it drops an instrument or is struck by any object while performing or practicing.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
