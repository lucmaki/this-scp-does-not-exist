<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-92</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-92 has been tied up in a box and stored in a standard containment locker at Area-██. A letter has been attached to the top prior to its neutralization, although it is unlikely to provide any information of use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-92 appears to be a black box with a cross inscribed upon the top. The inside of the box contains a human heart, located in the center of the cross. Testing has shown that whoever looks upon the heart experiences an adverse reaction. This reaction is only temporary, making it unlikely that anyone would survive the experience if they were to look upon the heart.</p><p>If left undisturbed for 30 days, the heart will begin to hemorrhage and deteriorate into a grey ooze. This ooze will slowly spread until reaching [DATA EXPUNGED]. If left undisturbed for more than 90 days, the heart will begin to swell and emit loud rhythmic pulses. The pulses become louder and longer after each pulse until stopping completely due to excessive pressure.</p><p>SCP-92 was discovered in a storage locker at ████████ University after reports of several students falling ill in a single night. A large amount of research material (see Addendum V) had been found throughout the locker; this included several scientific journals as well as numerous medical textbooks dating back to 1875 detailing symptoms similar to those reported by victims of SCP-92.</p><p>Following this discovery, Foundation agents infiltrated ████████ University using undercover identities and collected all equipment used by P████ ██████████, M████ █████████, and C████ █████████ (see List of Subjects below). While investigating an area of campus believed to have been affected by SCP-92, two additional subjects were discovered: M████ ██████████ and G████ █████████.</p><p>Subjects:</p><p>Notes: Upon examination, SCP-92 was found not to be radioactive or infectious.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
