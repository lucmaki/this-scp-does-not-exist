<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-331</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-331 does not appear to have any secondary anomalous properties, the object is to be contained in a standard Safe-class Safe Object containment locker. As of ██/██/2011, a security camera has been installed in SCP-331's container.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-331 is a set of six hand-bound volumes, all titled An Homily on the Language. The title page for each book is marked with an image of the emblem of the Order of the Holy Ghost, along with the word An underneath.</p><p>Each volume appears to consist of a single long essay, often followed by footnotes or additional, related essays. When read as a whole, they appear to be an ordered history of language usage and culture around the time that these books were written. However, individual volumes contain no such ordering; while they are assembled around a general date range, they are not ordered chronologically.</p><p>The first volume contains two essays: "An Universal Lingua Grammar" and "An Exposition and Defense of Etymology" (both dated 1402). The second volume consists almost entirely of a single essay titled "On the Consequences of Speechlessness", which appears to have been written in 1686.</p><p>The third volume contains a series of essays about the religious customs at different points in history; later essays within this volume include "A Compendium of Letters Sent from Jerusalem in AD33" and "The Halakha on Linguistic Honorifics". In addition, several essays in this volume contain annotations regarding historical events occurring during their composition. The fourth volume consists entirely of an 1855 treatise on linguistics titled [DATA EXPUNGED]. The fifth and sixth volumes contain one essay each—one is titled "On the Truthfulness of Tawdrīkūnā‘s Account", while the other is titled "A Memoir of Nabī Kidrūm al-Qumrī". The fifth thesis is dated 497 AH [12/18].</p><p>SCP-331 was discovered when [REDACTED] attempted to investigate SCP-331's anomalous properties. After attempting to open SCP-331 with a key found in his pocket, [REDACTED] fell unconscious after experiencing severe nausea and headaches; due to his injuries he was unable to open SCP-331 himself and was granted permission to contact agents for assistance. Agents arrived after 35 seconds and were able to recover SCP-331 from its container before it became damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
