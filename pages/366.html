<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-366</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area of the bridge over the Tagus River in the city of Lisbon, Portugal is to be monitored via closed circuit television. Apart from these restrictions, SCP-366 itself is to be kept in a secure storage facility in an abandoned office building in Lisbon.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-366 is a public square in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The area of SCP-366 measures 21 sqm and is the property of the City Council. SCP-366 has no anomalous properties other than its effect on human psychology and behavior at all times, even when no individual is within it.</p><p>SCP-366's effect is manifested as an extremely peaceful atmosphere in the immediate area, with an unusually high level of security and safety precautions taken against criminal activity. The affected area also manifests a highly effective, centrally-organized police force consisting of uniformly well-dressed officers who are invariably polite and always willing to help an individual in need, such as moving someone away from a fight or danger, or escorting individuals to their destination.</p><p>A further notable effect is that the entire police force will become passive upon exiting the area, including removing their badges and showing them to civilians who are not under investigation in any way. Should anyone be searched by police officers inside SCP-366 they may be found to contain various items in their pockets, such as cash or business cards.</p><p>As with most urban areas, traffic in Lisbon between 08:00 and 19:00 consists mainly of cars without drivers (especially taxis) and those with drivers who idle at stops for no reason outside of rush hour traffic. These drivers tend not to cause trouble unless they are disturbed by an external event such as a fire or accident. Drivers will unknowingly give up their seats to elderly or disabled persons if asked politely.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
