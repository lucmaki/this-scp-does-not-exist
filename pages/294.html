<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-294</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-294 is currently monitored by three (3) Foundation agents and set to a loose schedule at Site-56. SCP-294 is allowed to roam the perimeter of the testing room, but is not to be exposed to any of the objects in SCP-294's containment chamber. Should SCP-294 display any abnormal behavior or react violently towards an individual, all personnel are to immediately remove said individual from the scene and notify local law enforcement.</p><p>All subjects testing on SCP-294 are to use an animal model with a weight ratio of 100g of animal weight per 1kg of human subject. Subject should be transported via a standard cargo flight between the three (3) testing sites designated for SCP-294. Each test subject should bear the name and address of their respective test site. Any unauthorized visitors are considered hostile and are to be terminated on sight.</p><p>Should research staff encounter any anomalous activity in or around SCP-294, they are to immediately report the event via emergency response protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-294 is an indoor feline that has the appearance of a black and white domesticated Maine Coon cat. SCP-294 does not display any unusual physical properties, and cannot be detected with non-visual means. SCP-294 has been observed to state as its preferred form of communication by vocalizing phrases such as "watch me", "pay attention" and "don't ignore me".</p><p>When an individual with a mass of at least 100g (as determined via scientific scale) approaches within 2 meters of SCP-294, the following effects occur:</p><p>Final testing on this object must be approved by level 3 personnel only.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
