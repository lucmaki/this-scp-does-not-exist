<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-792</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has purchased the land surrounding SCP-792 to prevent its disintegration. The land surrounding SCP-792 is formally designated as Site-792. Personnel visiting the area are to inform their superiors of the border location of Site-792.</p><p>Foundation personnel are to report any changes in landscape within a one kilometre radius of SCP-792. Geologists are to be kept fully informed of any changes observed on a regional basis and will be given temporary containment until such times when further study is deemed appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-792 is an area of 3,800 square kilometers in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China. A large number of oil wells have been assembled in the area and are connected to a drilling rig. The rig consists of a steel tower with a drill mounted at the top. The facility is manned by one technician, who will be designated SCP-772.</p><p>SCP-772 will stay in its position on the rig until 992 Chinese yuan is deposited into any of the two security boxes along the base's perimeter. These boxes are inaccessible to non-Foundation personnel at this time. If neither box is opened, SCP-772 will commence drilling activities until either box has been emptied. Investigation into what triggers SCP-772's actions is ongoing. This behavior is limited to the area around SCP-772's location and does not extend to any other nearby areas or structures.</p><p>It should be noted that while SCP-772 has been observed working within an area of ████ square kilometers, there have been no recorded cases of SCP-772 being present outside this space.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
