<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-77</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-77 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to it is restricted to personnel with Level II clearance or higher, and any other entry is prohibited without permission from a Level III researcher. Personnel attempting to enter SCP-77's containment must wear protective breathing apparatuses at all times. No personnel are to remain in the area of SCP-77's containment for more than five minutes.</p><p>Should an instance of SCP-77-1 manifest in the area of SCP-77's containment, immediate reentry into SCP-77's containment chamber must be made until all instances of SCP-77-1 have been neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-77 is a humanoid male with no vital signs, formerly held at Site-██.</p><p>Instances of SCP-77-1 are anomalous human subjects (designated SCP-77-1 instances) that manifest as one of two possible outcomes from a high-stakes game of blackjack played at Casino ████ in Las Vegas. In order to successfully play the game, an instance must be given 25 Bitcoins, which are on record[DATA EXPUNGED] and have been confirmed obtained by the instance. Both outcomes will result in the death of an instance of SCP-77-1.</p><p>The name "Casino ████" has been redacted from all publicly available records. All instances of SCP-77-1 have been verified to be human beings through DNA testing, regardless of whether or not they were able to take out their own life during the game. Instances associated with SCP-77 were all goaded into playing Blackjack by a man identifying himself as Adrian Salinger, who was previously thought to be under Foundation surveillance prior to his disappearance.</p><p>SCP-77's physical appearance is currently unaltered; however, several minor anomalies are present. While its physical body remains unchanged, numerous internal organs have failed, and damage has been sustained to several major blood vessels. Its circulatory system fails at regular intervals due to damage sustained throughout its containment, each time resulting in a deadlier death for an SCP-77-1 instance. The heart has suffered the most damage; due to this it appears more vital than its other organs, though it does not function normally. Failure of the heart results in either massive bleeding or shrinking (see Addendum 77). Minor brain damage has also occurred due to repeated failures of vital tissue in SCP-77's head. Elasticity testing has shown that SCP-77's spine and ribs are now severely deformed, and that it cannot flex them without experiencing pain. Despite these damages and inconveniences, SCP-77 can move its arms and legs freely and displays no apparent discomfort or health concerns when carried out of its cell..</p><p>The second outcome is much more extreme; namely [DATA EXPUNGED]. It is believed that either the casino where SCP-77 was contained or the Foundation itself may hold the key to preventing this event.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
