<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-932</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-932 is to be kept in a standard Safe class containment locker. Contained objects are to be periodically assessed for SCP-932's presence, and removed from the facility if so.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-932 is a bamboo cane, 15 cm in length, with a small carving of a human hand on the other end. When SCP-932 is subjected to direct sunlight (the maximum range is 500 meters), it will begin mimicking the actions of the hand depicted on the other end. Any living thing that touches SCP-932 while exposed to sunlight will begin walking in the direction indicated by SCP-932's movements. The duration of simulation varies between subjects, but has been tested up to eight hours in one subject.</p><p>If SCP-932 is held, the subject will begin mimicking the hand's actions without direct sunlight. However, this effect is not as strong as when SCP-932 moves during daylight hours. The subject can be ejected from SCP-932 by force from outside observers.</p><p>SCP-932 was recovered from █████, ██ following complaints from residents over irregularity of local wildlife. Investigation has shown that all nonhuman animals affected by SCP-932 are Asian Elephants (Elephas maximus) and members of their species. No domestic elephants have been affected.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
