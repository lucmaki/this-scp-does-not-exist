<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-142</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-142 is contained in a standard containment chamber with four (4) meters of concrete flooring and two (2) meters of reinforced steel grid for testing purposes. Any form of “tick” or other parasitic organism is to be removed from the subject's body before initial testing, to prevent further detriment. Should SCP-142 expire due to any means, it is to be cremated along with any remaining traces of the specimen.</p><p>Any reports of SCP-142, carried by e-mail or other electronic media, are to be investigated immediately; an instance of SCP-142 has been reported in all 50 states, as well as Japan and France.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-142 is a human female, approximately ███ years of age at time of death. SCP-142, who was identified as “Missy Reynolds” by a police officer, died while attempting to remove a 200 cm long parasitic organism from her body.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
