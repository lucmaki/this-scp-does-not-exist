<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-768</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-768 is to be held in a spaced-locked standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Testing with SCP-768 is to only be conducted by research staff with Level-3 authorization, and must only entail the testing of non-anomalous examples of devices capable of producing audible sound or infrared radiation. Under no circumstances should experimentation with SCP-768 result in its direct death, as this event has been found to drastically change the nature of instances of SCP-768's anomalous properties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-768 is a humanoid entity, approximately 1.9m tall and weighing 78kg, with a number of non-anomalous features such as an unblemished skin complexion, normal male reproductive organs, and the absence of any implanted cybernetic components. SCP-768 displays a number of unusual properties seen in neither humans nor other animals, including the ability to perceive audible frequencies beyond those ordinarily perceivable by humans (unlike other humanoids), proficiency in the use of firearms and the use of conventional currency along with money types not previously observed in digital form, and possible resistance to conventional pain-inflicting weaponry. It should be noted that this resistance does not extend to all forms of conventional weaponry; however, no instances of SCP-768 thus far appear to possess this resistance to all types of conventional weaponry.</p><p>SCP-768 shows noticeable signs of aging when subjected to treatment by subjects with anomalous longevity or healing abilities; however, it remains biologically immortal. Its anomalous traits manifest whenever it is exposed to the creation of new instances of sound or infrared radiation. The effects manifest when SCP-768 perceives the creation of either a new instance of song or heat emanating from another source; examples include radio broadcasts, television broadcasts (including images conveyed over video screens), cellular telephone transmissions, and microwave ovens. These effects are detectable at a distance as far as ██km away from the source - but will cease if SCP-768 ceases its exposure to any source of audio/video/radiation for an extended period.</p><p>The exact nature of each effect produced by SCP-768 is shown below:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
