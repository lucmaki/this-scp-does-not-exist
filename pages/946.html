<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-946</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-946 is to be kept in a 4 cm (1:1) scale model of its natural habitat, the latitude of its presumed origin. It has been found that placing this model in an environment with a temperature of 21 °C and relative humidity of 50% has entirely eradicated its anomalous properties. A non-anomalous rubber ball is to be used for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-946 is the cryptid known as the "Secret Ball Runs Wolf" or "eelwolf" in the language of those native to the region through which it travels. SCP-946 appears to be a small pet eel, approximately 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long and 0.3 cm (µs) thick, which produces and uses an anomalous amount of water vapour from its body to propel itself at speeds up to 200 kph (approximately 109 mph). SCP-946's mechanisms for producing this vapour have not been determined yet.</p><p>SCP-946 has been found to be wildly popular among hikers, naturalists, and the elderly in regions such as Japan, South Korea, China and Russia, with reports of people attempting to capture it being unusually common. It is unknown whether SCP-946 will be able to maintain these rates of success indefinitely. However, on January 14th 1995 six hikers attempted to capture SCP-946 in its native habitat, east of Sapporo City. One hiker sustained serious injuries when SCP-946 knocked him into a nearby river; the other five were uninjured. A Japanese news report found on the Internet in mid 2001 shows footage of the encounter between SCP-946 and the hikers.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
