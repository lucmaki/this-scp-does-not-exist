<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-804</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-804 is kept in a secure room at Site-██. SCP-804's containment chamber is outfitted with two CCTV cameras, two microphones, and two speakers. The SCP and its environmental chamber are to be monitored continuously by a security camera and digital audio recording equipment. One speaker and microphone are located on the side of SCP-804. A second speaker is located inside the door of the SCP's containment chamber. During testing, this setup allows personnel to listen to the internal sounds of SCP-804 without interfering with its containment. Additionally, personnel are instructed to stay 2 meters away from the object during testing.</p><p>Audio recordings of SCP-804 will be played over loudspeakers in a testing chamber and recorded by video equipment whenever possible.</p><p>Any physical damage inflicted upon SCP-804 must be immediately repaired using appropriate materials; any permanent damage to the object must be addressed by repair before further testing may proceed. Failure to do so will result in immediate suspension of research on this object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-804 is a 3m long, 35cm wide and 25cm tall object composed of stainless steel with the appearance of a metallic filet-o-fish. SCP-804 will respond to any action within its field of view by emitting an audible sound, usually that of a sharp slap on metal. This range appears to extend at least 10 m behind the object and around 15 m above the object, but the exact limits are unknown. As with all objects given a non-penetrating subject, the sound emitted by SCP-804 does not travel beyond the object itself (i.e. outside its field of vision).</p><p>During testing, SCP-804's effect is limited to language; there is no discernible pattern to what it produces other than its speech syntax, grammar or vocabulary are similar to that of humans and contain no brand or proprietary name or mention of any individual or organization. In addition, no known language has been recorded by SCP-804 either before or after testing has been completed.</p><p>SCP-804 was found in the ████████ restaurant in ████████, ██████ on 12/20/1997. The owner of the restaurant had written "I have something very valuable inside my filet-o-fish" on a napkin and left it on the countertop when she went home for the evening. Foundation agents investigating reports of a possibly unidentified source brought SCP-804 to Site-██ where it was examined and contained shortly after capture.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
