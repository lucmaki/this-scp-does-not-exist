<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-717</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-717 is currently contained at Site-63, in a Standard Humanoid Containment Cage housing SCP-717. SCP-717 is fed one liter of water per day, and must be prohibited from consuming any food or liquids other than the water provided by Site staff. The water provided must be boiled before use and discarded after use. SCP-717 should be provided with a bed and a chair, and provided with access to a private bathroom with sink.</p><p>In the event that SCP-717 requires medical attention, it should be isolated in its containment cell until healing is complete. Non-vital organs should be removed if necessary in order to keep the body intact and prevent serious damage to the other organs and structures. In cases of infection, contaminated blood samples are to be tested for pathogens, and antibiotic treatments given as necessary.</p><p>During testing, SCP-717 should be given a 1,000 ml saline solution intravenously and anesthetic applied for 1 hour. Testing is to be conducted by Level 2 personnel only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-717 is the corpse of an unidentified male human. SCP-717 appears to be in its early to mid-forties, and has pale skin. SCP-717's body is heavily decayed, with its head and upper torso missing. Remains of clothing remain on the body, including a pair of athletic shorts, a white T-shirt, and gray socks with red borders. SCP-717 possesses no anomalous properties other than being dead. SCP-717 weighs 72.5 kg and is 28 cm in height.</p><p>SCP-717 is unable to decay naturally. If left undisturbed, the remains will eventually decompose into a pile of dust. However, if human intervention is used in order to prevent decay, SCP-717 will regain a more liquid state as time passes. SCP-717's body may then be removed from its skeletal harness and used by any human as desired - using SCP-717 as an experimental device or as part of a weapon is not permitted.</p><p>If any organ within SCP-717 is removed (excluding the brain), it will decay at an accelerated rate, but remain functional and pliable until the removal process has been completed entirely. Removal of one or more organs will cause all other organs to be affected at the same rate - for example, removal of both lungs and the heart can cause loss of kidneys and internal bleeding; removal of only the heart can cause vein failure and blood coagulation, while removal of both lungs can cause choking as blood cannot escape through damaged trachea; removal of only one kidney may render the other unaffected due to redundancy - removing both lungs will have no effect on heart function; etcetera.</p><p>If tissues attached to organs are removed, loss of life leads to complete disappearance from "real world" space - no trace remains that would indicate that anything living ever existed within them once removed. Any structure created within them will similarly vanish when fully taken apart, leaving behind no evidence that such structures ever existed within them in any form or fashion - for example, creating a complete house out of materials stored within a hollowed out tree trunk will immediately vanish after those materials are removed from the original tree. Foundation researchers must follow instructions regarding all objects created during use with SCP-717 - instructions given here do not apply specifically to items made while SCP-717 is working with living tissue as opposed to deceased tissue.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
