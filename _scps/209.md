<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-209</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-209 is to be kept in a lead-lined container. The container is to contain an accurate timepiece, specifically an atomic clock. A tachometer must also be present to ensure that the object does not get out of sync with the timepiece. The tachometer must be equipped with a timer in case it runs down on its own.</p><p>SCP-209 should be kept locked under guard in a safe chamber at all times. This chamber is to contain three (3) armed guards, who must be rotated regularly to prevent concurrence of duty. The guards are never to fail this rotation for more than twelve (12) hours in any given shift within twenty-four (24) hours from leaving duty.</p><p>No research into the purpose of SCP-209 is permitted unless approved by Level Three personnel. Approval will only be granted under special circumstances, such as if the researcher can prove their worthiness through aiding in the containment of SCP-███.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-209 is a small, circular object approximately three (3) centimeters in diameter. The center of the object has a hole that is one centimeter in diameter. The color of SCP-209 changes when the item is moved from a cold environment to a warm environment, or vice versa. No other markings or writing can be found on the object.</p><p>SCP-209 changes between its two states at random. During this transformation process, it will change its color before changing back to its natural state after 10 minutes of exposure at either end of its color range. SCP-209's dominant color will always correspond to its ambient temperature during this process. The natural temperature range appears to be between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] degrees Celsius.</p><p>When using SCP-209 as a timepiece, the anomalous effects do not occur; however, since 2001, it has been discovered that SCP-209 also accurately counts down in both directions. It also has an unknown atomic clock inside it, which is currently unable to be defused.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-209 was discovered in 2001, when the Foundation bought a home for its containment. During the house's inspection, SCP-209 was found in a bulk box. The Foundation admitted its possession of SCP-209 and removed it from the home. SCP-209 was then placed in a lead-lined container and brought to Site-██.</p><p>SCP-209 is currently kept in a safe chamber that has three (3) armed guards and an atomic clock. When not under guard, SCP-209 is kept in a lead-lined container at Site-██."]</p>
