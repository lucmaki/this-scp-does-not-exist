<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-789</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-789 is to be kept at each of its locations. An instance of SCP-789 is to be monitored at all times, and any interloper is to be detained under armed escort until the human subject has been located and removed from SCP-789's influence.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-789 is a tall, circular sheet of paper with the phrase "Fresh Whiff" written around its upper edge in red ink. SCP-789 is in fact composed of a stack of several sheets of paper, each differing from the others in ink color and typeface. Paper used in the creation of SCP-789 was cut from sized legal fliers originally printed to advertise local stores. All papers used in the production of SCP-789 have been recovered, but none have been recovered with the same logo on them as originally printed on SCP-789.</p><p>When an instance of SCP-789 is laid flat or otherwise placed flat against an object with a flat surface, it will cause any nearby human subject to perceive its object as smelling strongly of fresh air and/or flowers (see testing log). Subjects do not experience any ill effect other than a heightened sense that they are inhaling fresh clean air.</p><p>Objects touched by SCP-789 will always smell fresh to the point that no other odor could be detected through repeated testing. If a subject leaves an object touched by SCP-789 for 30 minutes or more while it is still being perceived as smelling strongly of flowers, during this time an identical copy of the scent will appear within the same vicinity where copies have previously appeared; this effect has never been duplicated by other methods.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-789 was recovered from a house in ████████, California after reports of the disappearance of several residents were reported by eyewitnesses. Mobile Task Force Phi-6 (Flowers) responded to the scene and discovered that SCP-789 had been placed on the ceiling of the home when it was occupied by a group of elderly residents. Upon removal, SCP-789 produced similar effects on all witnesses and a prolonged effect was observed on all witnesses when they were removed from the residence.</p><p>Forensic analysis of the residence was inconclusive due to extensive damage to the house during the incident. Testing with significant portions of the house was discontinued until further notice, as it is believed that a previously unknown source is responsible for SCP-789's anomalous properties.</p><p><strong>Testing Logs:</strong>"]</p>
