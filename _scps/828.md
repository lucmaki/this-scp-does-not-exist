<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-828</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Currently, SCP-828 is not considered a threat. As such, containment consists of amnesticization and monitoring. Recovered research should be destroyed or given to the Foundation's archives.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-828 is a blue Ford Western Star (FS model) tractor. SCP-828 is currently in very good working condition, exhibiting no unusual behavior. SCP-828 is capable of motion, and appears to function normally. SCP-828 was recovered from ██████, Idaho, after local authorities were alerted by a farmer of its disappearance.</p><p>Recovered research shows that the tractor's anomalous properties manifest when it is used to harvest crops or otherwise interact with the local ecosystem. Information on this phenomenon has been retrieved from ████ ████, the original farmer whose crop was harvested in this way.</p><p>SCP-828 displays little behavioral anomalies when not harvesting crops, and has shown no adverse effects which have not been identified as due to other forms of anomalous suppression. However, prior to experimentation on any living organism, testing should be performed on terrestrial matter .</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 828-1:</strong></p><p>It is theorized that SCP-828's anomalous properties are related to the area around where it was originally discovered, as SCP-828 does not appear to display anomalous properties in any other area. This theory is supported by the fact that SCP-828 displays its anomalous properties only when harvesting a crop from the area."]</p>
