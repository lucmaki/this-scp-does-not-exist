<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-344</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-344's body is currently kept in a secure vault at Site-19, with access restricted to personnel with level 2 clearance or higher. SCP-344 is kept in a modified humanoid containment cell, with the ceiling removed and replaced with a steel grid for additional security purposes. The walls of SCP-344's cell are lined with protective material to keep the vampire in her cell, and the floor is padded with rubber to prevent any contact with the ground.</p><p>Any time SCP-344 is left alone, it will attempt to leave its cell using its ability to use holes as portals. These attempts should be monitored, especially after SCP-344 becomes hungry. If she escapes, any personnel on duty should immediately alert security without fail. Even if she has been contained, SCP-344 must still be dealt with as quickly as possible due to the risk of contamination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-344 is a 5'11 male serial killer, designated SCP-344. SCP-344 is an anomalous individual who appears to be bound to an 18th century vampire named SCP-650. SCP-344 is fully capable of controlling its body, but only uses this ability to escape.</p><p>SCP-344 possesses several abilities similar to the standard abilities granted by vampirism. These abilities are:</p><p>However, it should be noted that SCP-344's abilities have been vastly reduced due to the nature of its containment and separation from SCP-650. Further research will be needed in order for SCP-344 to fully regain its abilities.</p><p>SCP-344 was caught on 1/5/2001 after a string of murders in St. Louis, MO. Following its capture, no SCP Foundation personnel had ever encountered SCP-344 before. One night, SCP-345 entered the cells of two Foundation researchers (Dr. ██████ and Dr. ███) while they were sleeping, strangled them both and proceeded to eat their hearts. Security footage showed that the holes appeared to form portals as the doctor's bodies sank into them.</p><p>Following this incident, all security cameras were destroyed and any surveillance footage was deleted.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum (1/6/2001):</strong> Despite the fact that SCP-344 is able to control its body, it is unable to enter portals. This has led us to believe that it is not actually bound to any vampire, but rather shares a psychic connection with an unknown object or entity. It is expected that SCP-344 will eventually regain its full abilities once this connection is severed.</p>
