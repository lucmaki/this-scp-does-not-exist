<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-604</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation operatives embedded within the Foundation for Deep Sea Research (FDSR) are to monitor SCP-604's containment zone. As of 10/24/2015, no ships have entered or exited SCP-604's area of effect.</p><p>As of 02/13/2018, exploratory expeditions have been approved by O Council.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-604 is a spherical vortex of blue-green electromagnetic energy, approximately 75 m in diameter. The energy surrounding SCP-604 transitions between several known levels (see table below), which is hypothesized to be its source.</p><p>SCP-604 produces a low-pitched buzz similar to that of a large insect. The intensity of the sound increases as SCP-604's radius decreases. No sound can be recorded or heard from within SCP-604's area of effect.</p><p>Over the course of approximately thirteen hours, this noise increases in intensity and frequency, becoming nearly inaudible during the evening hours when no ships are present within SCP-604's range. Ships entering SCP-604's area of effect will experience intense electromagnetic interference, rendered nearly impossible to navigate.</p><p>Upon entering SCP-604's area of effect, ships experience complete radio silence and vibration, followed by light and moderate electrical interference before finally exiting SCP-604's area of effect in one piece. Analysis indicates that the cause of this phenomena is not contained within the ships themselves; rather, it is caused by the ships' ongoing presence and use of mechanical systems as they remain within SCP-604's radius while under constant detection and communication. Ships not operating on traditional mechanical systems are unaffected by SCP-604's effects; however, ships completely reliant on such systems exhibit identical symptoms during the night hours when no other ships encounter the phenomenon.</p><p>Exploration Log 604: On 03/14/2018, an expedition consisting of D/O Council member Dr. K███████, D/FSR member D███████ and D/MTF Beta-9 "Kittens" sent into SCP-604 for the purpose of measuring its radius and radiation levels was lost following repeated power outages and electrical interference caused by SCP-604's effect on their equipment. All three personnel were lost at sea during a routine reconnaissance day patrol; testing of their bodies revealed that both air circulation and water intake ceased coincidentally at exactly 24:00 UTC with both men individually experiencing rapid coma death on their own respective watches. After 38 hours submerged at 32 m depth with no signs of life, the remaining two robotic divers were abandoned near the location where K███████'s remains were uncovered after testing confirmed his death earlier than predicted. The autonomous navigation system failure resulted in an erratic descent to the ocean floor until returning to base camp at 07:00 UTC with all three individuals deceased on site before rescue attempts could be initiated.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 604-1:</strong> On 12/31/2018, Foundation scientist D███████ discovered a previously unknown anomaly in the area of SCP-604's effect. The sky above the ocean was filled with dolphins, with an estimated count of approximately 200 individuals. The dolphins' appearance coincided with the appearance of SCP-604's effects on the surface, rendering a complete blackout in the area of effect and causing the loss of all communication equipment aboard the Foundation vessel, resulting in the loss of navigational data and confirmation of K███████'s death."]</p>
