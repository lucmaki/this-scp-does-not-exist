<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-536</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the location of SCP-536 and its lack of population, no containment procedures other than those for intangible objects are required. In the event that SCP-536 is ever "killed" in any way or ceases to exist, all extant instances of SCP-536 are to be contained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-536 is what appears to be the 1984 Ford Granada that has been designated as SCP-536-1. SCP-536-1 was recovered in a rural area of ████, USA and taken into Foundation custody. The circumstances of the recovery and its anomalous properties are detailed below.</p><p>At the time of recovery, SCP-536-1 was parked on a road near the ██████ border, outside of the town of ██████. There were no signs of any persons having entered or exited SCP-536-1 prior to its discovery by Foundation agents. No signs of damage or collision were present on the exterior of -1.</p><p>When first examined by Foundation personnel, SCP-536-1 possessed a note, which matched that of notes found in all instances of SCP-536. Commentary regarding this is pending further investigation (See Addendum).</p><p>The power windows on SCP-536-1, as well as the illumination system in the vehicle failed to advance when turned on. This was corrected within minutes of SCP acquisition by Apparatus maintenance staff. The vehicle's counter showed that it had been registered to 'Thomas Johnson', matching information that had been collected from several sources regarding SCP-536's anomalous nature and disappearance. Identifying Johnson as the owner was impossible given his present status as deceased, but his family confirmed that he had owned a 1984 Ford Granada at some point in his life, making this identification likely true.</p><p>Initially, Foundation personnel had reason to believe that SCP-536 resulted from an elaborate hoax or prank, however further investigation revealed an account for SCP-536 in several online databases dating back to 2001. Evidence such as security footage and photographs led to the identification of a missing person report filed by Thomas Johnson in 2001, indicating his presence in ████ at some point 30 years ago with family members who have not been accounted for nor seen since 2001. A body identified as belonging to Thomas was discovered at a cabin believed to match appearances of those associated with him during his disappearance; however, due to the advanced decay state of said body it could not be positively identified as being linked to Thomas or one of his family members.</p><p>Evidence indicates that Thomas ceased use of his car and began traveling alone around 1995 through 2000; surveillance photos indicate that he does not appear to have made special effort for concealment during this time period. After 2000 there is no trace of Thomas' presence ever again until 2003, after which he abruptly resurfaced having changed his name and moved to ████████ County, USA near ██████ with a new set of identification documents and driving record seemingly related to himself (as confirmed with police records). The aforementioned 2002 document was recovered from a search warrant served on Thomas' residence on 05/24/2003; documentation included documentation establishing Thomas' residence at 128 Riverview Road, ██████ at least since 01/01/2003 until 05/24/2003.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> It is not clear whether or not SCP-536 is a breach of any sort, but it is clear that there is a connection between SCP-536 and the events described in this document. This has led to speculation regarding something similar to SCP-836. As of 08/04/2018 further investigation has been deemed unnecessary.</p><p>SCP-536 was originally contained at Site-██ until its containment procedures were revised in June of 2000 to include its containment within a large vault with a time limit. This new containment procedure was designed to prevent SCP-536 from affecting the surrounding area through time travel. Over the past 20 years, SCP-536's anomalous properties have become more prominent and thus more difficult to thwart. On 04/08/2008, the current containment procedures were revised again to include a self-contained time loop that would affect only SCP-536 should it ever cease existing (see Containment Procedure 536-3)."]</p>
