<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-189</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-189 is to be stored in a standard Safe-class item locker. No personnel are permitted access to SCP-189 without Level 5 clearance, except testing purposes. When necessary to test the effect of SCP-189 on humans, either D-Class personnel or a human subject with no memory of prior exposure is required.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-189 is a standard 2.5 mm hardback diary. It reads "Houston, Texas." The cover itself appears to be of silk and contains no distinguishing marks aside from the title of the book itself.</p><p>When a human subject with no memory of prior exposure to SCP-189 attempts to write in it, they will experience a sensation akin to diarritm. This ranges from mild discomfort (as if shuffling) to severe pain (as if being kicked), depending on the amount of ink used. The degree of discomfort inflicted by SCP-189 may be reduced by allowing the affected person to rest for a period of time.</p><p>The more ink consumed, the louder the effect will be. A single sheet of paper will cease being heard when approximately 10 sheets are consumed, and increase in volume until approximately 200 sheets have been consumed. SCP-189 has never produced this volume without at least one full page remaining. If a journal or diary is not completed within five days after writing begins, the volume decreases until it ceases upon completion, except for very long journals (such as those created using SCP-189).</p><p>SCP-189 was discovered on ██/██/19██ when Foundation Agents ██████ and █████ discovered a body on █████ Street in Houston, Texas bearing a fatal wound consistent with an object being thrown at him. The victim had been identified as Ramesh Bhatnagar, a former ████ resident living in Houston since ████. The stroke that killed him was caused by a sharp object piercing his left eye socket and piercing his brain stem; however, he suffered several smaller wounds to his face and hands consistent with blunt trauma. Mr. Bhatnagar was confirmed dead at the scene. The cause of death was ruled due to cardiac arrest brought on by blood loss; poison cardiac arrest cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 189-1:</strong> Journal Entries</p><p>Journal Entry 1</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/19██</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Ramesh Bhatnagar</p><p><strong>Journal:</strong> How long I'm going to be able to continue writing this is a question I've been asking myself for the past two days. I'd assumed that it would stop being audible with the next page, but thinking about that seems like a waste of time.</p><p>So, I'm going to start writing again, and I hope that the pain will subside soon. There's not much else to do, and I'm getting tired of repeating myself.</p><p>Today, while I was in town, I saw a newspaper stand. I haven't seen one of those in a while, and they're so neat! The display cases are glass, and they have books on them. It's like they're just sitting on shelves, lined up neatly.</p><p>I don't know if I can afford to get any books out of it. I guess it's possible, but it would take quite a bit of money to spend at one place. I'd probably have to go to two or three different places to get all the books that I want.</p><p>I heard stories about book burnings during the war, and how some of the books that were 'unsuitable' were destroyed. That sounds awful, but you know what? Ever since then there haven't been any more book burnings. Everyone knows that reading is good for you, so why would anyone want to burn a book?</p><p>There was an old lady in town who used to give me candy whenever she saw me. She was really nice. Last week she asked me if I wanted anything from the book stand in town. It wasn't much, just some comics and stuff, but it was a start.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Journal entry fully edited into the journal."]</p>
