<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-25</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The island of ████████████ is to remain evacuated and closed to human entry until the following conditions are met:</p><p>1. An approximate ten mile radius around the object's location must be classified as a hazard zone with no electromagnetic interference. This zone should be mined in the event of a containment breach, to prevent unauthorized navigation of the area.</p><p>2. A group of at least five (5) trained Foundation field agents should be present on the island at all times, with twenty (20) additional assets stationed at nearby sites to be mobilized if necessary. Any civilian communications with SCP-25 must be traced and shut down.</p><p>3. Any anomalous object entering or exiting the zone containing SCP-25 must be contained within a lead-lined shipping container at all times, and cannot leave the containment area under any circumstances. Containment vessels must have a minimum four (4) meter air-filled containment compartment, and shipments containing SCP-25 are to be sent from site-19 rather than from the site itself.</p><p>4. The majority of Foundation assets stationed at sites near SCP-25 are to remain on high alert for both biological organisms and anomalous objects within its vicinity, but this is not considered a direct threat to containment of SCP-25 by other means.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-25 is an entity with the appearance of a large, vaguely bipedal reptile. SCP-25 has several appendages which appear to be "arms", but these extend from the back and not from the shoulder as is typical of similar entities. SCP-25 is hostile to all personnel, but has shown no ability or desire to attack or harm humans in any way given its scale, how much it depends on them for sustenance and how little it can really hurt them within its area of effect.</p><p>SCP-25 appears to be omnivorous, but often feeds most heavily on the flesh and blood of humans, particularly those with a high caloric intake and increased stress levels. Its diet also includes other sea life, such as fish, shellfish and small invertebrates. It seems to prefer human blood over other types of food, possibly due to its suffering tolerance or reduced macrophage activity, but this preference does not seem to affect its ability to obtain nutrition from other sources.</p><p>SCP-25 actively hunts and consumes marine life until that food source is depleted, then moves to new hunting grounds. Noncorporeal entities such as SCP-27 will continue to hunt for SCP-25 based on its location until it is destroyed by any means.</p><p>SCP-25 cannot move towards or out of the hazard zone described above, even if it leaves the area around its containment vessel. Attempts to escort SCP-25 away from the area have had no permanent effect on its movement patterns (see Incident 25-01). SCP-25 is able to interrupt radio transmissions or shut down surveillance devices through anomalous means, but this has only been observed in combat situations, when SCP-25's aggressive behavior toward human beings would almost certainly lead it to attack first rather than try to escape.</p><p>Two instances of SCP-25 are currently contained at Site 19: one brought in at 15:58 hours GMT (06:58 PDT) on ██/██/1989 by [DATA EXPUNGED], the other secured on ██/██/90 by Agent ████████ and Agent ██████ after a battle against both undersea wildlife and a large quantity of armed civilians. Both instances were contained with minimal damage; however incidents tending toward combat have resulted in more substantial damages inflicted upon both instances over time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
