<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-512</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-512 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber, lined with tarpaulin and concrete. SCP-512's restraints are to be padded and locked in place. Its food ration is to consist of one (1) chocolate bar each day.</p><p>As of 20██, SCP-512 has been assigned the identity █████ ██████ and is currently housed in Site 69's Behavioral Sciences Wing, where it is allowed access to recreational reading materials at the discretion of its psychological team.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-512 appears to be a Caucasian male of age fifty. SCP-512 possesses no distinguishing physical abnormalities other than its eyes, which appear to have been removed at some point prior to its classification.</p><p>SCP-512's behavior is virtually identical to that of a nonanomalous human being, aside from the following:</p><p>SCP-512 has not demonstrated any ability to vocalize or interact with other individuals aside from the Foundation personnel assigned to work with it. Attempts to infect individuals with SCP-512 are currently prohibited by O-class personnel.</p><p>SCP-512's relationship with the Foundation is unclear; it claims to have been approached by an unnamed individual, who provided it with an envelope containing several hundred US dollars, as well as instructions for how to reach the Foundation's anomalous properties division.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Interview Log 512-1</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-512</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ██████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Standard interview to determine the identity of SCP-512.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr. ██████ sits down in front of SCP-512, a pen and notepad within her hand.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Good afternoon, SCP-512. My name is Dr. ██████, and I'm here to ask you a few questions about your circumstances, if you'd like to answer them.</p><p>SCP-512 remains silent for nearly a minute before speaking.</p><p><strong>SCP-512:</strong> You can call me Dave, if you wish. It's all right if you don't believe me, but I've got no reason to lie.</p><p>Dr. ██████ nods, proceeding with the interview.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> I see. So, Dave, could you describe your 'situation' to me?</p><p><strong>SCP-512:</strong> Right. Well, it's simple as far as I'm concerned. I'm here because I do what I do best. I offer up my services to the highest bidder, and accept payment without question. But this time, it's different, isn't it? This time, something caught my eye and made me stop to think. There's a little girl out there who needs me more than anyone else in the world right now, and she doesn't know it yet. That's how this whole thing started, really.</p><p>Dr. ██████ waits for further elaboration on SCP-512's response; however, it remains silent for the remainder of the interview session.</p><p><End Log></p><p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> SCP-512 was reclassified as Safe after a psychological evaluation determined that its current behavior is consistent with that of an amnesiac human being with no knowledge of its anomalous properties."]</p>
