<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-370</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-370 is to be held in a standard Safe object locker at Site-77. It is not to be removed from its chamber except for testing purposes by at least two (2) Level 2 personnel and no less than two (2) Level 4 personnel. Any personnel attempting to enter the chamber without authorization must be met with lethal force.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-370 is a wooden statue of a humanoid female figure. The figure has no body parts missing and is otherwise in good condition. When examined closely, the figure closely resembles an early 20th century photograph of Dorothy Dietrich.</p><p>SCP-370 displays no anomalous properties outside of its containment chamber. It was first discovered lying in its original location, resting in a wooden box along with the handwritten note:</p><p>When opened and inspected closely, the note reads:</p><p>The note is written in French and was found amongst SCP-370's possessions. The lettering is faded, as if written long ago, but possesses a distinct handwriting style.</p><p>The enclosed item is SCP-370-2, a crudely carved wooden disk measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter inscribed with symbols and runes. No two instances are exactly alike and have differing designs and colors. Each instance appears to have been carved by hand from a single piece of wood around 500 to 1000 years ago.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 370-1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████, an unidentified individual attempted to open SCP-370's case. Instead of opening the lid, he attempted to lift the statue from within its case causing it to levitate into the air and land on the far side of the room. Security personnel responded to the incident and brought the statue to the containment chamber; it was found to be non-anomalous.</p><p>On 09/12/████, a researcher noticed that SCP-370's hand had moved slightly during testing. When asked about it by a researcher, SCP-370's hand stated:</p><p>After further investigation, it was discovered that when a researcher spoke directly to SCP-370, it would respond in the same manner. Over time, the response rate increased (see Addendum 370-2) until all instances of SCP-370 were speaking fluent French.</p>
