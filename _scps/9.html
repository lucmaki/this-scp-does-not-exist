<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-9</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9 is to be kept in a low-humidity storage container in Site-77. SCP-9 is to be monitored by an automated weather station to ensure that the temperature remains between 10°C and 20°C. In addition, SCP-9 is to be moved at least once every ten days to prevent corrosion of the valves.</p><p>Should SCP-9's ventilation system fail, it is logistically feasible to construct a replacement apparatus. However, due to the risk of contamination by SCP-9's unique content, such an act would only be permitted following the presence of a team of three (3) Level 3 personnel. Immediately after maintenance work begins, all personnel are to wear full protective suits and Hazardous Environment Suits (HES).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9 is a plant grown in the interior of a large steel-and-aluminum storage tank. Owing to its anomalous nature, it has been maintained and studied by the Foundation since its discovery in 1972. SCP-9 is large enough to require a team of two (2) Level 3 personnel to move. It consists of a mixture of water and dried fish, which are believed to be the cause of its growth rate. This growth is aided by the presence of a naturally occurring, highly conductive fluid in the bottom of SCP-9's container.</p><p>The content of SCP-9 is extremely unusual; however, this is believed to be caused by an unknown property embedded within the plant material. The liquid inside SCP-9 appears to be composed entirely of sodium chloride (common salt), although any compound formed from sodium chloride would not normally remain liquid at room temperature. As such, SCP-9 is able to remain at its current temperature regardless of what method is used to cool it down below its boiling point (which has so far been reported as 31°C). Addition chemicals have been known to help solidify the salt, sometimes becoming visible through SCP-9's clear walls.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 9-A:</strong> On ██/██/██, a group of researchers attempted to remove the plant from SCP-9's container. As the plant was lifted by the researchers, the fluid within it began to rapidly condense into ice, creating a large block of solidified salt. The researchers were unable to move the block and were forced to wait for it to melt. After approximately two (2) hours, the salt had completely melted, and the plant had returned to its normal state.</p>
