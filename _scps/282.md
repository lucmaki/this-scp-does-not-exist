<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-282</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A small containment unit has been constructed in the forest surrounding Site-19 in order to contain SCP-282. SCP-282 is to be fed a diet of approximately 25 kg of hay two times per week. Any raids by SCP-282 are to be met with armed response; personnel are to avoid direct contact with SCP-282 at all costs.</p><p>In addition to on-site containment, testing with SCP-282 is to take place during the months of October and November only, due to the temperament of the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-282 is a herd of female elk (Cervus elaphus) measuring 56 cm in length and weighing 16 kg. SCP-282 is highly territorial; it has demonstrated the ability to detect intruders long before they reach its habitat.</p><p>However, during testing with SCP-282, it has been shown to exhibit a secondary effect upon approaching humans; SCP-282 tracks down individuals or objects which are considered to be "good" via target tracking. Therefore, once an individual is tracked down and brought within a rather small, circular area of SCP-282 territory, there will be no further effects, save for mild euphoria in the subject(s).</p><p>SCP-282 has also demonstrated the ability to sense and track animals known as "virgin land". When an animal matching this description appears within its habitat, a distinct mating/courting behavior will manifest. The participating cows have been observed to become agitated and possess elevated levels of testosterone and oxytocin. The calves which result from this mating have all shown increased resilience to predators through increased size and aggression in their young age.</p><p>Approximately every 50 days, at a rate of 10% per year, SCP-282 will go into a period where it will exhibit behaviors akin to that of human pregnancy. During this time, its appetite will decrease by 20%, causing low food intake and weight loss of around 5 kg per day. In addition, the main group of cows will have difficulty walking due to their swollen bellies.</p><p>It is during these periods that SCP-282's anomalous intelligence manifests itself; when an animal matching the description of "virgin land" enters its habitat, SCP-282 will attempt to mate with it using any available method. In most cases this has resulted in the death of both subjects; however, in rare cases one or both subjects have survived depending on their temperament towards other members of the herd. Due to their vulnerability at this point in gestation and due to the unpredictable nature of how they tend to react towards the other side, experiments involving mixing SCP-282 with a non-anomalous member of its species have been halted until further notice.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Testing Log 282-1</p><p><strong>Experiment 282-1:</strong></p><p>Subject: SCP-282</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Two new elk (both males) were introduced into the enclosure of SCP-282. The elk were then separated by a soundproofed partition, and left for two weeks.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> A third female (this time an unaltered animal) was introduced into the enclosure. Upon reaching maturity, all three females were given to D-Class personnel, who were instructed to breed them with one another. The resulting calves were taken from their mothers, and were later implanted with implants to ensure the survival of the offspring.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> After a week of gestation, both implantations successfully took place.']</p>
