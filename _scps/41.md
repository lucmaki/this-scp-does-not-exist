<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-41</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-41 is kept in a specially constructed reinforced metal box and stored in Site-31's anomalous item vault. It is to be handled with care while being transported to and from its containment unit, as it has been known to [DATA EXPUNGED] when stressed or moved too forcefully. Any personnel who are affected by SCP-41 are to be terminated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-41 is an "anomaly", a fluctuation in physics. Despite its anomalous nature, SCP-41 is currently the single most popular item among Foundation personnel, second only to the members of Task Force Upsilon. This is because all personnel tend to enjoy puzzles and the challenge of working with a particularly bizarre item.</p><p>SCP-41 has certain effects on scientists who handle it, similar to an amphetamine. If handled carefully by a trained technician, SCP-41 can be used to enhance their ability to think and reason, allowing them to solve complex mathematical problems which would otherwise be impossible for them to see through or comprehend. This effect disappears if the user does not handle SCP-41 for over five hours, or if they are distracted from it.</p><p>Although temporarily enhanced intellectual capacity is not considered harmful at this time, using SCP-41 in any way besides its intended purpose will result in blurred vision and extreme auditory hallucinations. The active ingredients within SCP-41 cause these effects, most likely as a result of being constantly combined or combined with other chemicals over time. In order for research teams and technicians to continue handling SCP-41 without suffering these effects, amnestics are available on request.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 41:</strong> Due to the popularity of SCP-41 and the possibility of adverse effects, it is currently undergoing tests to determine a suitable containment procedure.']</p>
