<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-517</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-517 is kept in a standard Safe-class storage locker at Site-██. The storage locker has been fitted with a motion sensor and proximity alarm, and its interior is to be checked every six (6) hours; any changes from the approved configuration are to be reported to site security.</p><p>Recovery Log 517-A: On 9/13/19██, SCP-517 was sent to Site-██ for testing purposes. While under testing, SCP-517 began exploring its new environment. Security personnel attempted to take over SCP-517's containment chamber using a mobile task force, but this proved unsuccessful. After thirty (30) minutes of investigation, SCP-517 ceased movement and spontaneously reconfigured itself into an eggplant.</p><p>After sixty (60) minutes of monitoring, SCP-517 reconfigured itself again into the previously observed pattern of two humps, one on the right and one on the left. SCP-517 was returned to its original configuration and placed into a standard safe containment unit.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-517 is a humanoid entity, 78 cm tall and weighing 75 kg. SCP-517's head is that of an eggplant, with the external appearance of the fruit and the interior properties of a vegetable. The skin of SCP-517 is resistant to temperature extremes, though its internal organs are subject to temperatures as high as 3200°C (5180°F).</p><p>SCP-517 displays almost no reaction to pain; as such it can be dissected without disturbing its actions or position. When removed from its native environment, SCP-517 will recreate itself within twenty-four (24) hours. It shares many properties with plant life, but with some key differences:</p><p>SCP-517's physiology is largely incompatible with human anatomy and has been observed to cause various organs to rupture under stress. However, SCP-517 is capable of surviving indefinitely in this state and has remained alive while suspended in open space.</p><p>SCP-517 possesses an extremely aggressive behaviour and will actively attack personnel. Due to its lack of normal human reflexes, SCP-517's attacks are very accurate and difficult to evade. When directly attacked, SCP-517 will attempt to bend any sharp object it can into a leaf shape and use it as a flail weapon. SCP-517 also has shown a strategic grasp for tactics and seems to place a high priority on survival, often taking measures which would be fatal to mere humans.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-517, during testing</p><p><Begin Log, 9/13/19██, 10:00 AM></p><p>SCP-517 is observed to be moving around its containment chamber. A head-up display has been installed and is uploading diagnostic data. At 10:08 AM, SCP-517 moves into an observation chamber and begins observing the test subject.</p><p><strong>SCP-517:</strong> (in English) Can you hear me?</p><p><strong>Object:</strong> Dr. ██████</p><p><strong>SCP-517:</strong> (sputtering) Hah! Is that you?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> (in English) Yes, it's me. What do you want?</p><p><strong>SCP-517:</strong> (sputtering) You're the first person I've seen in a while. You're alive! You've got to help me! I'm on my own out here!</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Crying for help? What are you, some kind of plant?</p><p><strong>SCP-517:</strong> (in English) I was a human once. My whole life is gone now. Don't leave me here! Please! I'll be good!</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> How about you go back to your little vegetable thing and eat your vegetables?</p><p><strong>SCP-517:</strong> (in English) No one understands! I'm trying! I'm trying so hard! Why won't anyone help me!? Why does everyone ignore me? Why can't anyone see how much I love them!?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> There's no reason to be so dramatic. If you wanted someone to understand how you were feeling, you could have written a letter or something.</p><p><strong>SCP-517:</strong> (in English) But they don't care! They never cared! Nobody ever loved me or understood me or cared about me or anything I did! They just left me out here to die!</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> You should try to eat something before you get too upset. You're not going to die if no one loves you; maybe it would be better if you just died with dignity by doing something that you wanted to do anyway.</p><p><strong>SCP-517:</strong> (in English) … Okay. Just let me talk to them one more time. Just one last time before I disappear for good. Please?</p><p><End Log, 10:12 AM>"]</p>
