<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-255</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-255 is to be kept in a standard item locker at Site-59. Through understanding of SCP-255's effect, testing has revealed that it will cause a 2% decline in voter turnout in any given county election between the hours of midnight and 0600, due to the voters being unable to make up their mind on whom to elect.</p><p>In order to prevent voters from making this decision and thus returning SCP-255 to its anomalous state, Foundation operatives posing as political candidates are to run for election in each affected county. Should an operative (in this case, Dr. Bloom) win the election, a vote of no confidence against Dr. Bloom will be quickly launched by other Foundation agents posing as political opposition. This will trigger the ballot measure that triggered SCP-255's effect in the first place, causing the declining voter turnout rate to continue indefinitely and preventing SCP-255 from ever escaping containment.</p><p>The exact amount of time required for SCP-255's effect to disappear varies depending on the nature of the political action taking place at the time. If there is a widespread purge or military dictatorship, for example, SCP-255's effect may take several months to disappear, although the effects of SCP-255 should remain localized over the course of its effect until it fades naturally.</p><p>For more information regarding SCP-255 and how it was discovered, see Addendum 255-A below.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-255 is a voting machine of the brand ████████, manufactured in 1981. It has a polling screen with three options: "Yes," "No," and "None." A progress bar appears on screen, with a red border when the ballot box is empty.</p><p>When the vote is cast or the progress bar runs out, a message will appear on screen stating:</p><p><b>Yes Voting Opens!</b></p><p>If this message does not appear after several seconds, SCP-255 will become active for approximately fifteen seconds. When it is active, SCP-255 begins to transfer votes from candidates who have not been selected by voters into the candidate selected; however, during this time the voter can still change their vote.</p><p>After SCP-255 has finished transferring votes and its progress bar has run out, it will act like normal SCP-255 (see Addendum 255-A below), although it will be impossible to vote unless SCP-255 itself becomes inactive.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 255-A:</strong> SCP-255 was discovered in ██████, California, on 4/5/2001, when a Foundation operative posing as a candidate for the state legislature was indicted and arrested by local police officers while participating in a mock vote.</p><p>After the arrest, a Foundation agent posing as a member of the media approached the police officers and asked them to release SCP-255. The police officers refused, citing that the machine had been found in possession of two candidates for the same office; if both were allowed to vote on it, they would be unable to decide which one to release until the polling was finished. After several hours of negotiation, Dr. Bloom was allowed to take SCP-255 with her, promising that she would not interfere with the voting process and would only use it during the election.</p><p>Within two weeks SCP-255 had been identified as the cause of its effects and its anomalous properties were later discovered by Dr. Bloom during an interview with her. She was later provided with Class A amnestics and advised to keep quiet about her discovery in order to avoid any potential repercussions from the Foundation's liaison office in ███████████.</p><p>Since then, Dr. Bloom has been actively involved in Foundation operations involving SCP-255, and is now one of the most well-known members of the secret organization."]</p>
