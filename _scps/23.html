<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-23</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-23 is kept in a reinforced containment case at Site 77, with further security measures as detailed in Document 23-2. SCP-23 is to be kept under constant observation and recorded on D-Class personnel at least every hour.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-23 is a wooden facsimile of the Solvay telescope, used to search for extraterrestrial intelligent life in space. The original Solvay telescope is located in the International Space Station. When an intelligent extraterrestrial life form is discovered, the image of SCP-23 will be transmitted to an orbiting satellite and then back to Earth.</p><p>SCP-23 retains no anomalous properties other than the image transmission. It has been tested repeatedly with non-anomalous versions of the original solvay telescope and all have produced identical results. Testing with different locations on Earth and in space have yielded identical results for SCP-23's anomalous functionality.</p><p>Automatic telescopes displaying SCP-23 are being installed at major astronomical observatories around the world to assist field personnel in identifying inhabited extraterrestrial planets if they are found by current technology.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 23-1:</strong></p><p>On 6/09/2016, SCP-23 was used to show an image of Mars on Earth. The image showed Mars as a large red circle with several smaller circles surrounding it in varying degrees of red. Mars was described as having "a face" that produced the image.</p><p>Following this incident, Foundation personnel were deployed to investigate Mars and research any potential extraterrestrial life forms. The following is a summary of initial findings.</p><p>After several days of research, SCP-23 was used to transmit an image of Mars\' surface to Earth. The following is a transcript of the transmission.']</p>
