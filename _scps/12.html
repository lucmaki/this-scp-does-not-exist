<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-12</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All information concerning SCP-12 is to be closely monitored by the Foundation and its allies. In the event that SCP-12 appears on any major political or ecological stage of life, all personnel assigned to the events are to detain SCP-12 and remove it from public view. If possible, it is recommended that classified photographs of SCP-12 be taken at these events, and either suppressed or distributed around governmental entities as cover for SCP-12's containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-12 is a large and unusual tree which, despite its immense age, has a remarkable amount of vitality. SCP-12's wood is incredibly sheer and extremely light, permitting SCP-12 to be towed most anywhere by small boats such as canoes without any loss of strength. In addition, SCP-12 regularly exudes a mildly narcotic poison from its branches that causes mild hallucinations in humans who come close to it. In addition to this, the presence of SCP-12 often appears to increase the life expectancy of all species living near it, often by several years.</p><p>SCP-12 is sapient, but behaves in an extremely passive and childlike manner, similar to [DATA EXPUNGED]. In addition, SCP-12 seems to show no interest in controlling the world around it. It presents itself simply as a large and infinitely valuable tree with a bizarre affect on all life about it.</p><p>There are two unusual aspects concerning SCP-12:</p><p>The first issue may seem trivial at first glance. After all, most trees have some sort of long-term effect on their environment, whether through photosynthesis or through absorbing carbon into their leaves. However, the second item is much more interesting; what makes trees sapient? Any animal or plant that possesses consciousness could claim that they were sapient, but does this not go against human knowledge? If trees can claim to be sapient, then can [REDACTED] be claimed to be sapient? How can we go about defining the line between sapience and subconsciousness? And if trees are being so cooperative in our efforts at containing them (due to their effects on sapience), why don't we just let them die off rather than forcing them into containment?</p><p>Digging Deeper</p><p>In an effort to understand SCP-12 more fully, researchers have been able to do what they normally cannot; observe SCP-12 in detail. Below are some excerpts taken from audio logs recovered after Foundation agents infiltrated [DATA EXPUNGED]'s government. The nature of these events indicates that SCP-12 appears shortly thereafter.</p><p>Excerpt #1</p><p><BEGIN LOG></p><p>Drumming sound begins at 03:38:43 over the loudspeakers in the crowd watching SCP-12</p><p>Drumming gets louder until 04:00:47; singing begins at about 04:04:53</p><p>Singing begins simultaneously with drumming throughout the park</p><p>Singing does not get loud enough for anyone else to hear until 04:10:03 (memories indicate singing was audible throughout park)</p><p>At 04:17:47 there is a sudden "squeal" coming from the crowd as they begin screaming at both sides of SCP-12 (seemingly independent entities) as well as apparently punching themselves in the face strenuously with their hands</p><p>The face punches must have had some effect on [REDACTED] because suddenly at 04:18:22 it seems as though [REDACTED] has grown three times its normal size and its arms had sprouted into vines over 50 meters long by 04:20:50 (a second growth spurt)</p><p>At 04:21-'22 there is a second mass exodus from the park as people attempt to escape from SCP-12's anomalous changes; dogs and cats also attempt escape during this time period.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum SCP-12-1:</strong> Analysis of SCP-12\'s effects.</p><p>SCP-12\'s effect on sapience is very profound and detrimental to all life in the area, which is why its containment is vital. However, it is also apparent that SCP-12\'s effect on sapience may be beneficial to the species it affects. If SCP-12 were to die, this would cause large amounts of sapience to be lost and thus sapience would decrease across the world. If the sapience loss is too great, sapience may become obsolete, with new species eventually taking over.</p><p>However, if sapience continues to increase due to SCP-12\'s presence, then greater chances for sapient life will exist over time. This would have large political implications across the world, but most important would be the increasing sapience of humans themselves. In addition, it may very well result in the ultimate goal of sapience; a true understanding of intelligence itself.</p><p><END LOG></p><p>Excerpt #2</p><p><strong>[DATA EXPUNGED]:</strong> A man in [REDACTED] (the country where SCP-12 appears) attempting to arrest a child was affected by SCP-12\'s effect and began running around in circles, screaming incoherently at random intervals. The man was heard screaming "I am not my father! I am not my father!" at least 50 times before eventual death.']</p>
