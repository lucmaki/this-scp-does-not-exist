<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-413</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All information regarding SCP-413 must be concealed from the general public. It is to be kept in a secure storage facility until further notice, when it will be contained in an SCP in a similar manner.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-413 refers to a life and death manifestation where a human subject is hypothetically granted access to all knowledge of life. If a human subject is not in possession of that knowledge, it is impossible for them to understand anything in their current lifetime. If, however, a human subject is capable of understanding everything that they are aware of, they will return immediately to the previous point - time (if they are aware of this, they are capable) without any memory of partaking in the experience.</p><p>SCP-413 was initially discovered by an agent working on a study regarding post-mortem memory retention in humans. The subject successfully manifested as described above and disappeared. The disappearance was noted as unexplained and was linked to an unidentified manor. A unit consisting of thirteen agents was sent to investigate the mansion and locate what had occurred. The agents found no sign of the subject until one week later when one agent touched the wall and discovered five words written there from the perspective of the subject: Life and Death.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> The Foundation has not had access to the subject since his return. Due to the subject's knowledge of the Foundation, we have classified SCP-413 as Keter and no further attempts are to be made at contact with the subject.</p><p>SCP-413 is currently being stored in a secure facility, where it is not to be viewed by any personnel."]</p>
