<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-304</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has acquired the services of a security firm to monitor SCP-304's location, and to remove any new instances of SCP-304 found at XK-9. As of 07/25/2009, it is currently estimated that SCP-304 consists of 585 instances.</p><p>Due to the nature of SCP-304, all unauthorized individuals should be prevented from approaching within a kilometer of SCP-304. Any individuals who attempt to access SCP-304 should be detained, and the area should be quarantined for at least five (5) days to ensure that no new instances have been created.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-304 is a Foundation controlled system, consisting of approximately 15 designated instances. Instances are capable of generating auditory and visual stimuli in response to specific media files, which may be played on a computer system or played directly on a small device (such as SCP-304-1). SCP-304 is located in the town of ████████, Canada, at the home of Dr. James Everetts, who has been responsible for "cleaning up" the anomaly.</p><p>Media Files:</p><p>When viewed by an individual within ear-shot of SCP-304 instances, auditory and visual stimuli will match the media file in question. Auditory stimulus will include:</p><p>Visual stimulus will include:</p><p>After observing these stimuli for thirty minutes or more, subjects will enter an agitated state and begin to display physiological and psychological effects related to the triggering media file. None of this stimulus has attracted attention from outside sources outside of investigation events involving SCP-304. These effects will last for twenty-five minutes, during which time subjects cannot perceive any additional sensory input except their own heartbeat. After this point, subjects will begin to vocalize constantly in response to the stimuli they have been exposed to previously or have been exposed to subsequently; however, unless they are interacting with other individuals affected by SCP-304, they will not notice when others are vocalizing. Any persons who do not exhibit signs of upset after twenty four hours have been affected by SCP-304 are considered nonanomalous and may be detained at Site ██ while awaiting transport back to their original location.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong> The following is an archive of recordings of persons affected by SCP-304.</p>
