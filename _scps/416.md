<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-416</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe (two levels</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-416 is to be secured in a standard Safe Object containment locker.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-416 is a motion sensing security system with built-in quartz monitors. When set in motion, SCP-416 will activate and begin to record an area of the surrounding environment. The feed appears as live video, but actually occurs simultaneously in real time. Detection of the signal on magnetic tape by Foundation investigators led to its discovery.</p><p>Audio recorded through SCP-416 is subject to a number of anomalies that have not been properly explained by anomalous means or methods; however, they do pose no threat to Foundation personnel.</p><p>The nature of the recording has allowed tracking of the account's behavior over time. Through this method, it has been determined that the account has been established through theft from several companies (including ████ Security Systems) and subsequently had its feed monitored by the Foundation for several years following these incidents.</p><p>Foundation scientists have attempted to learn more about SCP-416's workings, including attempting to determine how to prevent it from recording and how many people are watching at any point. They have discovered that SCP-416 does not require a continuous video feed, but can also record audio; however, it only records audio on an irregular basis when prompted by an outside stimulus such as provided by a human voice.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-416 was originally discovered on ██/██/████ inside the home of █████ █████████, who had been reported missing by his wife. The Foundation was able to trace the account back to ████ Security Systems and discovered that it had been created when security personnel were unable to locate █████████ for several months. A Foundation agent posing as a representative of ████ Security Systems was able to track the account back to █████████'s home and it was secured."]</p>
