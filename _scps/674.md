<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-674</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-674 is to be kept in a humanoid containment cell at Site-19. The object has been observed to appear in various locations around the wing, but is not to be moved from its current location for any reason. Before usage, SCP-674 is to be given a meal consisting of approximately 1 kg of meat and 4 liters of water.</p><p>It is recommended that personnel check the kennels on a daily basis for any evidence of SCP-674 activity. If it is found, either (1) area is to be flooded with a non-flammable liquid; or (2) the area is to be set on fire and extinguished using firefighting equipment. Personnel are to be present when SCP-674 is in use, and avoid direct eye contact with the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-674 is a humanoid entity composed of a human skeleton and muscle tissue. The head, torso, arms and legs are segmented like those of a scorpion. It possesses one functioning arm as well as one functional claw on each hand, although the claws do not function in any way except for basic manipulation. SCP-674 can speak English fluently and appears unable or unwilling to use any other language.</p><p>SCP-674's primary anomalous property manifests whenever it perceives itself to be in imminent danger. Any hostile act toward it by another entity will result in SCP-674 berserking (initially into a state of anger and then into an uncontrollable state of rage) until all threatening elements have been neutralized, or until it is neutralized by the hostile being(s). In this state, SCP-674 is capable of inflicting severe damage to any targets within its reach.</p><p>If restrained or held down, SCP-674 will attempt to break free using its clavicle rather than the joints which are weaker. If the bone breaks, SCP-674 has shown no signs of pain; however, it will continue trying to escape until either its target(s) have been destroyed or it is completely unable to move.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-674 was discovered in the basement of a home in █████████, ██████. The home had been abandoned for over 10 years and had not been maintained. The owner had been reported to the police shortly after the initial discovery, but no charges were filed. Investigations have revealed that the property was purchased by a nearby animal shelter and later sold to a family which moved into the home shortly thereafter. Several vultures that had been feeding on the body were removed to prevent contamination; however, the body was left in its original location.</p><p>The following report was issued by Agent ████████, who was assigned to contain SCP-674.</p><p>On ██/██/████, SCP-674 was observed escaping from its containment cell. Responding agents were able to incapacitate the subject using standard Class-D amnestics and restraints. Later investigation revealed that several instances of SCP-████ had attached themselves to various items in the home; upon removal of the items, the creatures ceased movement and began to solidify into stone.</p><p>Later investigation revealed that prior to this incident, several items of furniture (including several books) had been moved from their original locations. Several bloodstains were present on them, as well as a pair of surgical gloves. The gloves contained DNA which matched that of Dr. ███████, who was believed to have been deceased at the time of his disappearance.</p><p>The following is a transcript of a conversation between Dr. ███████ and Agent ████████, who had been assigned to apprehend him.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] Hey there, boy! How're you doing?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] Fine, sir… How are you?</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in a British accent] Oh I'm fine, thank you for asking! I was just about to make some tea for myself before heading off for work. Tell me, son - do you like it here?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] Well… I mean, yes sir… It's very nice here…</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in a British accent] Good to hear! Now get up here and say hello to me!</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] Wait… You're… You're dead! How—?</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in a British accent] Oh but I'm not dead at all! I'm right here with you - right now! Isn't that right, boy? Say hello!</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] Hello?</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in a British accent] Yes! Say hello again! I can see you out of the corner of my eye! Tell me what you're thinking! Please?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] … Sorry, sir… I can't do that…</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in a British accent] Why not?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] Because… you're dead! You know what that means? You're gone! You can't be with me anymore! You… can't be with me anymore!</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in a British accent] Ah, but I am with you now - or at least, I will be soon enough! Now tell me what you're thinking - please?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] …I can't do this anymore… We're done… It's over… Gonna go back to my desk and let them handle it from there… Okay? Okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in a British accent] Excellent! We'll be leaving shortly then - I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on this morning so we should be okay until tomorrow night - oh, wait - do you have any plans for tomorrow night?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> [Speaking in an American accent] No— Why does that matter? Is it important?</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> [Speaking in a British accent] What do you mean important? Of course it's important - we've got plans for tomorrow night! We're going out, aren't we? Aren't you excited? Let me guess - we're going dancing! To one of those fancy clubs around town - maybe even New York City if I'm lucky! Ooh - I'd love to go there sometime - it'd be so fun to dance all night long on those floors - did you know they have those things inside certain buildings now? Marvelous invention really - would've been even better if they'd just made them more widely available. Ah well - can't complain too much though - I don't think they've really taken off yet but once they do they'll be the rock stars of nightlife all over the world! Isn't that exciting, boy? So what do you say we go dancing tomorrow evening then? Sound good? Huh? What'd ya say boy? That sound like fun right? Yay fun!
