<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-340</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-340 can no longer cause harm, containment efforts are limited to preventing further dissemination of this information.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-340 is a generic death certificate from the state of New Jersey. It was recovered from the home of Dr. Richard Davenport when he was executed for attempting to attack a colleague with a knife. The certificate identifies two deceased individuals as "Josie and Davey Packwood".</p><p>SCP-340 does not appear to be anomalous on its own, but upon being read by research personnel, it will predictably cause them to recall recent events with great precision, including unpleasant ones. In particular, the subject will vividly remember the last time they saw their children before reading SCP-340. If they have not yet done so, they will usually take action to see them once more.</p><p>This effect lasts four hours after SCP-340's reading and is irreversible; no amount of medical treatment or amnestic has been able to help subjects return time to normal once they have experienced SCP-340's effects. When the subject returns after this period of time, it appears that all memory of the event has been replaced with a detailed impression of what happened and how it went down. Subjects, who at this point are often inconsolable, reveal little about themselves during this period but seem to take as little emotional damage from it as possible. A person's reaction to getting reacquainted with their children is often extremely negative, regardless of whether they are upset with their parenting or not. This unfortunate outcome can be prevented if the subject is given a date and place where they gave an interview once again following their reacquaintance with their children; however, doing so results in less traumatic memories being retrieved in these instances.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 340-1:</strong> Recovered Interviews</p><p>On 19/06/20██, SCP-340 was recovered from the home of Dr. Richard Davenport, who was executed for multiple counts of aggravated assault and one count of attempted murder. SCP-340 was found in his possession.</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. Davenport was the lead researcher on SCP-████ and was a close friend of its creator, Dr. ████. Following his arrest, he offered to provide information on the anomaly in exchange for clemency, which was granted by the Foundation. He was interviewed on 05/07/20██ at Site ██.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. █████</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Richard Davenport</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Dr. Davenport was escorted into interview room ██. Upon entering, he began weeping immediately and followed up with an apology for some of the things he had done to his colleagues and family members. He claimed to have been under extreme stress during this time and blamed his behavior on his wife\'s death. He also mentioned the death of his wife as being the reason he had not contacted his children since their birth. When asked what he would say to his children if given the opportunity, he only shook his head and said "I can\'t do this." The interview ended shortly after due to Davenport\'s lack of willingness to continue with it.</p><p>[…]</p><p></p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Richard Davenport</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Upon being asked how he felt when he last saw his children before reading SCP-340, Davenport said "My daughter was getting married that day." This was verified by a witness present at the wedding to whom the subject had sent a text message prior to this interview stating "I\'m at [redacted] watching my daughter."</p><p>[…]</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Richard Davenport</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Asked what they would say if they could give their children one more chance at life, Davenport said that he would correct any mistakes they made and be a better father than he ever was for them. He then began crying again and stated that "My kids will never forgive me." When asked what he would say if he could talk with them again, Davenport asked for the tape recorder to be turned off and then said "I miss you guys so much."</p>
