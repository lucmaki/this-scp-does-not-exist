<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-871</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-871 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with the door secured and locked. SCP-871 may be removed by Site-77 personnel upon request, but is otherwise not to be handled by unauthorized personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-871 is a pair of sunglasses fashioned out of plastic, with the identifying label "FOUND IN HILLARY'S BEDROOM, NEW YORK". The lenses are heavily scratched and bent out of shape, the frame itself appears to have been repaired several times. When worn, SCP-871 displays a compulsion to corrupt Foundation personnel who view it.</p><p>SCP-871 will attempt to corrupt any individual who views it as soon as they remove it and put it on. After approximately 15 minutes, SCP-871 will manifest an urge to break into Foundation facilities and steal any valuables, especially if those items belong to SCP objects. Despite this, SCP-871 will flee from Foundation security personnel instead of actively attacking them. SCP-871 has shown no sign of ability to speak; however, there are indications that whatever "speaking" mechanisms SCP-871 possesses are at work.</p><p>As well as its behavior, SCP-871's effects do not extend to off-site personnel or Site-77 staff. It is currently unknown how SCP-871 acquires information regarding Foundation facilities and personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 871.1:</strong> SCP-871 was recovered from the suite of former US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on January 9, 2011, following articles in the news stating that the "Chinese government has come under fire for repeatedly trying to access the email account of Hillary Rodham Clinton".</p><p>During initial Foundation investigation into their origins, SCP-871\'s presence in Mrs. Clinton\'s personal effects was noted. SCP-871\'s anomalous properties were not detected until 1 month later, when a member of Site-77 reported feeling compelled to take SCP-871 off and put it on. Upon doing so, she immediately began to feel ill and lost consciousness. A Foundation medical team was called, and it was determined that SCP-871 was responsible for the effect.</p>
