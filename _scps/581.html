<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-581</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-57 is to be used as a maintenance and storage facility for SCP-581.</p><p>SCP-581 has been registered as a missing person case with the Foundation's Regional Missing Persons Bureau in the state of New York. Contacts have been made to the local police department to monitor the case. In the event of its discovery, Protocol 581-P has been enacted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-581 is a black 1991 Ford Mustang convertible. Its current location and identity are currently unknown.</p><p>SCP-581 is one year older than its appearance would suggest. It is currently assumed to have been stolen while still in production by a third party, though no evidence has been found to support this theory.</p><p>Note: While SCP-581 appears to be functionally identical to its current design, due to the lack of information regarding its manufacture date, it is impossible to verify the appearance of SCP-581 prior to its disappearance.</p><p>SCP-581 acquired its name when classified as such by the Foundation's Regional Missing Persons Bureau. Due to the unusual nature of SCP-581's anomalous properties, Protocol 581-P was enacted for its containment on 6/4/1911.</p><p>Protocol 581-P was implemented after six months of failure in attempts to recapture SCP-581 (See Addendum). Each repetition of Protocol 581-P has resulted in a different outcome, though all tests thus far have failed due to SCP-581's location and our inability to capture it in camera. Attempts to track SCP-581 through GPS or phone signals have proven futile due to repeated interference from sources unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-581\'s current location is unknown. It has been tracked over the last sixty years, but to date has evaded capture. A list of known SCP-581 sightings is provided below (See Document 581-A).</p><p><strong>Document 581-A:</strong> Known SCP-581 Sightings</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 6/4/1911</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> New York City, New York, United States</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-581 was located in the rear parking lot of Site-57. The driver, a female estimated to be in her late twenties, attempted to flee after its discovery. She was sedated by agents and taken into custody. Upon questioning, she described a third party who had stolen SCP-581 from a dealership in New Jersey and left it at Stormy\'s Auto Repair in Manhattan. This individual was described as being around five feet tall and weighing between 130 and 145 pounds. Due to the lack of identifying information, she was subsequently given the moniker "Mack" by Foundation agents. Mack has since been given an amnestic treatment and released.</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 22/10/1978</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> New York City, New York, United States</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> On the evening of 22/10/1978, SCP-581 was discovered inside a fish market on the Lower East Side of Manhattan by D-90318. D-90318 claimed that he had seen SCP-581 in an alleyway and followed it back to its owner. Upon being approached by witnesses, Mack began shouting expletives towards the witnesses before attempting to flee on foot. The witnesses managed to follow her back to her vehicle and incapacitated her using a stun gun before returning to D-90318. Mack was taken into Foundation custody and interrogated regarding the origins of SCP-581. She stated that it had belonged to her previous owner, who had purchased it one year prior to her own disappearance. Mack\'s former owner was questioned shortly thereafter, and confirmed Mack\'s story of purchase and disappearance. The police were contacted and Mack transported to Site-57 for further questioning. Upon arriving at Site-57, Mack was placed under temporary restraint pending further research into this incident.</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 30/1/1931</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> ██████, ██████ County, Ohio, United States</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> Mack was located in western ██████ County, Ohio by local authorities with no memory of her circumstances prior to her placement in Foundation custody. No attempts have been made to locate Mack after this event due to SCP-581\'s location and the fact that Foundation personnel have no knowledge of her current whereabouts. However, it should be noted that all attempts thus far have been unsuccessful due to interference from unknown sources.</p>
