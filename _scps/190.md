<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-190</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The grounds of the Long Meadow Ranch have been secured from trespass in the interest of preserving the site for future study and to allow for the continuing investigation of SCP-190.</p><p>A perimeter security fence has been constructed around the perimeter of the property. The primary gate on this perimeter gate is to remain locked at all times; exceptions to this have been authorized only for research purposes or when an authorized test subject is being transported.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-190 is the designation given to an unidentified entity that appears to be a male horse of the Morgan, Standardbred and Friesian breeds. The entity is estimated to have been born in the year 1840 and is familiar with the region of ████████, Montana.</p><p>SCP-190 has limited high level knowledge of modern human technology, primarily being able to identify interacting components within mechanical structures (e.g. gears, cogs, pulleys) when questioned. Although SCP-190 has shown a preference for associating with humans and ponies, it is otherwise non-hostile towards other animals and has been known to interact with any equine species (including domesticated variants) even when not directly involved in testing procedures.</p><p>SCP-190's anomalous properties become more apparent after exposure to large amounts of data stored in printed and electronic forms. Subjects exposed to large quantities of printed data will quickly become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. This disorientation causes subjects to display symptoms consistent with general cognitive disorders and/or dementia; however, subjects do not show overtly negative responses to these symptoms or have any demonstrable deficits in their cognitive abilities. When exposed to electronic data subjects will become disoriented if they attempt to engage in reading on their own without a device that can interface with said devices. In cases where subjects are unable to assemble this information into functional systems they will immediately lose all awareness of their physical surroundings and lapse into catatonia until physically removed from their environment.</p><p>There does not appear to be any correlation between exposure time needed for these effects to occur in individuals and the amount of data involved; however, records indicate that prolonged and repeated exposure appears to have resulted in severe tissue damage at lower levels of exposure.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 190-1:</strong> Additional details regarding SCP-190's anomalous properties have been compiled from interviews with former residents of the Long Meadow Ranch.</p><p><strong>Interview 190-01:</strong> Interviewed: Dr. ████████, Site Director of the Foundation's Mobile Task Force Gamma-9. Interviewer: Agent ████, assigned to Gamma-9.</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Agent ████:</strong> Alright, so what's your story?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> I'm here to see if I can help you with a problem. A horse has been causing some issues here at the ranch.</p><p><strong>Agent ████:</strong> What sort of issues?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> He's been leaving hoof prints on your walls and trying to chew up electrical equipment in the barns. I think you know what we're talking about.</p><p><strong>Agent ████:</strong> I know what he does! We've been trying to catch him for months! Every week we get new reports of his latest antics, and it seems like there's always more when we finally track him down.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> So what do you want me to do?</p><p><strong>Agent ████:</strong> Well, I need him out of here before he chews up my mainframe or something. You know that's going to be a huge problem for us!</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> He doesn't sound like he's all that dangerous. What are you afraid of?</p><p><strong>Agent ████:</strong> He isn't dangerous, but he's a nuisance and we're not allowed to just let him roam free for the public to see. If we catch him next time he does something like this, we're going to have to turn him into an exhibit and try to get permission from the town hall or something…</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Just tell me where he is and I'll take care of him.</p><p><strong>Agent ████:</strong> Alright, hold on…okay, no problem. Let me just pull up your file…yeah, here we go…here's the report on last time he was spotted in town…hmm…not sure if this means anything, but according to Catherine over at the hospital he's been behaving differently lately…maybe it has something to do with the weather? She says the last few weeks have been unusually rainy and he hasn't had any problems with that…oh well, I guess it doesn't really matter now…thank you Doctor, you're a lifesaver!</p><p>[END LOG]"]</p>
