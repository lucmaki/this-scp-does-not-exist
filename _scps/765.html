<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-765</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-765 is not to be approached by uncontained kites of any kind. Anyone who witnesses SCP-765 in flight will be taken into custody if feasible; the relevant containment area must be evacuated and gassed with █████ when necessary. Attempts at containment and tracking of SCP-765 are unlikely to succeed. See Incident Log 675 for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-765 is a pair of lepidopterans of undetermined species, approximately 1.5m in length, inhabiting the Pacific Northwest Region of the United States Pacific Northwest. SCP-765's wingspan has been measured at 2.5m; its weight is estimated at 22 kilograms. It is capable of spontaneously flying using its wings, and can access its internal batteries by spreading its wings to form a cover over its abdomen.</p><p>The only known method of communication between SCP-765 and other kites or humans is through emitting a weak electromagnetic field when unoccupied or in flight, which is audible to human observers. This field is similar in strength to that produced by common commercial electronics such as surveillance cameras. Despite this, SCP-765's full appearance remains unknown.</p><p>Recovery: On ██/██/████, two men in their twenties were observed reeling lines off a dune near ████████ Beach, Washington State on the Olympic Peninsula with cameras attached to their necks. One of the men had ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms before entering the area, while his friend was under the influence of [REDACTED]. The man who was not under the influence observed SCP-765 alight on a small pebble, while his friend called out "Hey it's some sort of fucking dragon!" and took pictures with his camera. When all but one of the photos turned out blurry due to motion blur, he decided to retrieve it from his beach bag in order to save film. Upon doing so he was taken by surprise by SCP-765 and immediately ran into the woods for evacuation efforts. Shortly after SCP-765 disappeared, police officers arrived and reported seeing something suspicious lingering on Dungeness Spit around sunset time, as well as several sparrows scattered about that appeared to have died after falling from a great height without explanation.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that all of the photographs taken that day had belonged to Dr. ████████ ████████████ (who has since been forgiven). His office at ██████ University was raided and all photographs were confiscated along with an incomplete manuscript titled 'Arrows and Kites'. Further investigation has revealed this manuscript's title alone[2] to contain all information known about SCP-765 – including previously missing details such as:</p><p>Despite these observations being confirmed by Dr. ████████████, the nature of SCP-765 remains unknown – presumably because it cannot be contained.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
