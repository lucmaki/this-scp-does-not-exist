<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-426</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-426 is currently contained at Site ██, hidden within a nondescript wooden cabinet. Access to SCP-426 requires the approval of Level 4/426 staff members. In the event of an emergency, any personnel with level 2 clearance or higher may gain access to SCP-426 for the purpose of restoring power or initiating rescue.</p><p>SCP-426 is to remain in its cabinet at all times. When not being used for testing, clearance staff may unlock the cabinet to retrieve SCP-426 for testing purposes, provided it is within a ten (10) meter radius of their position.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-426 is a non-functional computer keyboard sold by █████ ██████████, an electronics company based in Miami, Florida. The original packaging states that SCP-426 costs $34.95.</p><p>When a program is stored into SCP-426 for five (5) minutes and one (1) keystroke made, SCP-426 will begin speaking the contents of the saved program to any nearby personnel. Audio output from SCP-426 is always unintelligible gibberish, but visual output appears as a two (2) dimensional representation of the programming area where the "down arrow" function is utilized.</p><p>SCP-426's vocalized program contains nonsensical phrases such as:</p><p>SCP-426 will continue its vocalization for around five (5) minutes before ceasing. Unless retrieved at once, SCP-426 will repeat the same phrase until all memory space has been filled.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-426 was recovered on ██/██/2000 by Site ██ Security Forces after the ██████████ Electronics Company's offices were attacked by five (5) of an unknown entity. Due to the nature of the attack, SCP-426 was immediately secured and transported to Site ██."]</p>
