<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-678</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All Foundation databases are to be updated weekly to reflect the change in SCP-678's value and ownership. Currently, SCP-678 is considered a Type I safe object. Security personnel are authorized to carry out any action necessary to secure or prevent its loss or theft, such as those involving tracking or counter-surveillance measures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-678 is a small, metal, triangular dog tag. The item's appearance and aura are identical to that of any other Foundation issued object, leading researchers to assume it is an ordinary object of its type. SCP-678 possesses the anomalous property of changing in value upon the death of its subject.</p><p>This change in value comes into effect whenever SCP-678 leaves the possession of its current owner, or a Guardian Order member attempts to gain control of it. Upon the death of its owner, SCP-678 will begin to decrease significantly in value until it reaches a value of $0 USD/£0 GBP/¥10 JPY. At this point, SCP-668 will also cease to exist.</p><p>When such occurs, the item's previous owner will reacquire ownership through unknown means. In addition, within one week after the reacquisition date, SCP-678 will become active again according to the following schedule:</p><p>In order for a new owner to gain control over SCP-678, executive staff must first verify that it is not currently active at a cost above its new value. Once this has been verified and with approval from the O Council, it is then possible for new owners to take possession of it.</p><p>Any attempt by an individual with an estimated net worth below $2 billion USD/£2 billion GBP/¥20 billion JPY to acquire SCP-678 must be canceled and vetoed by O Council members before they can take possession of it. Such individuals include politicians and former heads of state; CEOs of major corporations; socialites; retired military personnel; etc. If a new owner is not able to acquire SCP-678 in this way within 12 months (720 days) following the date it changes in value for them to do so, they may challenge O Council members for control over it if they have accumulated greater wealth than them.</p><p>After having taken possession of it, all new owners must report their acquisition in Foundation records located within secure government databases managed by third parties chosen by O Council members. Failure to comply with these procedures will result in their obtaining ownership through unfair means and consequently have their project(s) terminated by O Council members.</p><p>A new owner shall then present it for inspection by doctors appointed by O Council members before being granted control over it at which point they may indicate whether or not they wish to "pass" on ownership or continue using it as intended.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum SCP-678-01:</strong> SCP-678's death was announced on ██/██/20██. Upon the announcement, SCP-678 began to decrease in value due to a massive increase in security efforts from O Council members and the Foundation. After one week, SCP-678's value had dropped below $0 USD/£0 GBP/¥10 JPY, at which point it was taken into Foundation custody.</p><p>SCP-678 was subsequently examined under the guidance of Dr. █████ and his research team. Following the examination, Dr. █████ was reminded by O Council members that they would be taking over SCP-678 and completed his report following this action. Dr. █████ inquiry into how SCP-678 lost its value was ignored by O Council members, who instead requested further reports on the object's anomalous properties in light of its acquisition by the Foundation.</p>
