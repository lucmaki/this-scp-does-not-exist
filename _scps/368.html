<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-368</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-368 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. SCP-368's appearance has been altered to more closely resemble its namesake, Nikita Khrushchev. Two security cameras have been installed to allow the location of SCP-368's quarters in any given workweek. The contents of SCP-368’s quarters are to be routinely searched for unauthorized items. Any items found to be anomalous are to be possessed by and handed over to agents stationed at Site-██.</p><p>The room containing SCP-368 must remain locked at all times when personnel are not present. No personnel may enter this room without authorization from at least two (2) Level 4 personnel, with the exception of medical staff and agents tasked with the removal of any items found in the room.</p><p>No personnel are allowed on Level -3 when the room containing SCP-368 is open except for Level 4 personnel or those actively handling an item. No personnel are allowed within 90 meters of Level 3 while SCP-368 is active.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-368 is a humanoid entity, approximately 1.5 meters in height and weighing between 50 and 60 kilograms. SCP-368's appearance appears to be that of a male human named Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, born circa 1894, however it is currently unknown how it has assumed this form. Food items consumed by SCP-368, including those with anomalous effects, appear to cause it to reform in a new guise within one to two days.</p><p>SCP-368 appeared in its current state on 17 February 1989. SCP-368 was initially held at ██████ ██ on charges of theft of an anomalous item from Site-██. SCP-368 was able to generate an unusual amount of publicity for itself whereupon the facility stationed at Site-██ was forced to relocate to a more secure location. On 25 February 1989, after several weeks of investigation into its anomaly, SCP-368's containment was upgraded from guard dog status to that of Keter class and placed under the jurisdiction of Dr. ████████'s Windowless Bunker project.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
