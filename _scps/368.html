<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-368</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-368 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. SCP-368's appearance has been altered to more closely resemble its namesake, Nikita Khrushchev. Two security cameras have been installed to allow the location of SCP-368's quarters in any given workweek. The contents of SCP-368’s quarters are to be routinely searched for unauthorized items. Any items found to be anomalous are to be possessed by and handed over to agents stationed at Site-██.</p><p>The room containing SCP-368 must remain locked at all times when personnel are not present. No personnel may enter this room without authorization from at least two (2) Level 4 personnel, with the exception of medical staff and agents tasked with the removal of any items found in the room.</p><p>No personnel are allowed on Level -3 when the room containing SCP-368 is open except for Level 4 personnel or those actively handling an item. No personnel are allowed within 90 meters of Level 3 while SCP-368 is active.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-368 is a humanoid entity, approximately 1.5 meters in height and weighing between 50 and 60 kilograms. SCP-368's appearance appears to be that of a male human named Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, born circa 1894, however it is currently unknown how it has assumed this form. Food items consumed by SCP-368, including those with anomalous effects, appear to cause it to reform in a new guise within one to two days.</p><p>SCP-368 appeared in its current state on 17 February 1989. SCP-368 was initially held at ██████ ██ on charges of theft of an anomalous item from Site-██. SCP-368 was able to generate an unusual amount of publicity for itself whereupon the facility stationed at Site-██ was forced to relocate to a more secure location. On 25 February 1989, after several weeks of investigation into its anomaly, SCP-368's containment was upgraded from guard dog status to that of Keter class and placed under the jurisdiction of Dr. ████████'s Windowless Bunker project.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On 6 March 1989, SCP-368 was allowed to leave its containment cell in order to retrieve a package containing a copy of "The Communist Manifesto". Upon its return, SCP-368 claimed that it was unaware of its location prior to the theft.</p><p>After this incident, SCP-368 has been allowed to leave its quarters to visit the cafeteria on 4 separate occasions. The following is a transcript of the first time SCP-368 visited the cafeteria:</p><p><strong>SCP-368:</strong> Hello there. I have a question for you. Are you at all familiar with the USSR?</p><p><strong>Cafeteria Worker:</strong> I\'m sorry? No, I\'m afraid not.</p><p><strong>SCP-368:</strong> My name is Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev.</p><p><strong>Cafuberty Worker:</strong> Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev? I\'ve heard about that man, but I didn\'t know he was still alive!</p><p><strong>SCP-368:</strong> It has been quite some time since my last visit here, does the name ring any bells?</p><p><strong>Cafeteria Worker:</strong> Oh my God! You\'re him! What\'s your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-368:</strong> Well now my friends call me… Nikola or Niko.</p><p><strong>Cafeteria Worker:</strong> Wow, that\'s awesome!</p><p><strong>SCP-368:</strong> Yeah, it is. I mean, when you\'re that old, you start taking yourself too seriously. Couldn\'t get much respect for what I did.</p><p><strong>Cafeteria Worker:</strong> Can I ask you another question? How can we get more copies of the manifesto?</p><p><strong>SCP-368:</strong> You can’t help but wonder what would happen if they ever decided to make it illegal. You know they did try at one point… It was kind of funny watching them try to defend it.</p><p><strong>Cafeteria Worker:</strong> Yeah, but how can we get more?</p><p><strong>SCP-368:</strong> That’s not something I can answer for you, kid. You should figure that out by yourself. You may not be up here very long though. I mean what\'s so great about being stuck here in this little hole?</p><p><strong>Cafeteria Worker:</strong> I don\'t know… I don\'t think anyone really knows what they\'re doing here besides me and him.</p><p><strong>SCP-368:</strong> Well then, just remember to keep your head in the game and maybe you\'ll end up doing something worth talking about.</p><p><strong>Note from Dr. ████████:</strong> As far as we are aware no further incidents have occurred since SCP-368 was upgraded to Keter status.</p>
