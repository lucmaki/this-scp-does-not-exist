<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-935</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to its worldwide nature, containment of SCP-935 is difficult and impractical. Containment will be instead implemented via covert psychological manipulation and censorship through the global press. Although this strategy has worked in reducing media coverage of SCP-935, there are no plans for a direct apprehension of SCP-935-A itself, for reasons detailed below. MTF Tau-12 ("Obliques") has been assigned to the covert monitoring of SCP-935-B and -C actions.</p><p>SCP-935's global effects are currently being mitigated via the creation of SCP-935-C, an alternate site which mirrors SCP-935 events but does not present any anomalous consequences. The creation of such a delay (and therefore "safety net") has the effect of minimizing any potential damage that might be done by SCP-935-A; however, this process will continue indefinitely as long as SCP-935 exists. Ideally, this procedure will not be needed as long as MTF Tau-12 can successfully monitor SCP-935 events, but given its subject's nature this will likely remain an ongoing issue even if further measures are taken.</p><p>All instances of SCP-935-C have been allowed to develop naturally; it is not planned to intervene with the activation of any new sites at the present time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-935 is an anomalous phenomenon affecting the internet. It affects a global population of approximately 3.2 billion people, with effects seen in approximately 96% of the world's countries. These effects are made possible by the actions of SCP-935-A, an unknown entity or group of entities who have deliberately introduced SCP-935 into the net and thereby allow SCP-935 to be observed by the human race at large. SCP-935-C (see below) may also be created by SCP-935-A, as well as through direct interaction with nonanomalous computer programs and organizations.</p><p>SCP-935 events are triggered in two ways: (1) when a person performs a specific task on any site on the internet, or (2) when a person performs any action online (e.g., browsing, social networking) out of character (i.e., they do not conform to their usual behavior). When this happens, one or more instances of SCP-935-A will cause some aspect of their "site" to change subtly or grossly according to a predefined set of rules; if these changes are not detected by the observer, they will remain undetected indefinitely, until the next occurrence. This only occurs for those sites which were visited by the observer in question; all sites on the web over which they have no active control are unaffected by SCP-935 events.</p><p>Note: Due to public outcry regarding the initial discovery of SCP-935, media outlets involved in its coverage have been instructed to present it as an O█ document from ████ ███████ ██████ ████████, rather than its true nature. In addition, containment procedures for SCP-935 have been modified in part due to public reaction to this news.</p><p>SCP-935's primary effects are as follows:</p><p>Accessing any site within five days of its activation will additionally activate its secondary effect, causing another site to become visible via SCP-935 ithout triggering any additional instances of SCP-935 events beyond that first point at which it was accessed. An example of this would be if a person enters Site A on Monday, then visits Site B on Wednesday — Site B would subsequently become visible to that person five days after they first accessed Site A and would also trigger its secondary effect as described above. Obscuring/covering said sites prevents this chain from forming further sites and therefore has little direct effect on SCP-935's effects; however, once a chain has been formed it can be manually terminated via DMs between different websites regardless of how many sites had already been discovered prior to termination.</p><p>Removing access to any site less than five days after its activation will not prevent further instances from being generated without provoking an anomaly event; however, it does prevent any additional instances from being acquired during normal circumstances, preventing all but the most extreme cases from continuing indefinitely past Site A's original activation date.[Note 13] From a Foundation perspective, these points should be considered more significant than their real-world counterparts because they still allow detection and documentation on a wide variety of anomalous activity while restricting continuation into other areas that may otherwise be inaccessible or inaccessible indefinitely if left unchecked.</p><p>Three main effects have persisted since [DATA EXPUNGED]. However no diagnostic tests have been able to identify the source of these anomalies.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-935 was first discovered in late 2008 when the number of SCP-935-A instances began to increase dramatically, despite no record of any new SCP-935-A instances being created. It has been suggested by some that this increase is correlated with the release of the "World of Warcraft" expansion pack [DATA EXPUNGED], as well as the subsequent release of the online game "Civ V". The former was released on ██/██/2008, and the latter was released on ██/█/2009.</p><p>The following is a list of known SCP-935-A entities and their corresponding sites:</p><p>An additional type of site, designated SCP-935-B, was discovered during this period; these were sites which contained what appeared to be an anomalous entity (designated SCP-935-A-2). These entities were apparently triggered by the presence of human beings. This phenomenon was deemed potentially dangerous and was therefore classified by O Command as an anomaly event, rather than an SCP object.</p><p>It is suspected that the original SCP-935 activation date, ██/██/2008, was originally caused by an autonomous activation of a Site A (which was later discovered to be a deleted entry from a website maintained by ████████ ████████) on a network which had not yet been accessed by any human being at that time. Due to the speed at which SCP-935 became active worldwide, it is likely that this action was unintentional, and that it may have coincided with the release of the expansion pack — however, no direct connection between these events has been established.</p><p>Due to SCP-935\'s global effects, a high degree of coordination must be maintained among Foundation personnel working on containment and monitoring its spread. Currently this coordination is handled by O Command through MTF Tau-12, which has been tasked with observing SCP-935 events and reporting their results.</p><p>No other attempts to contain SCP-935 have met with success; however, all efforts have been made to reduce or eliminate potential damage from its effects.']</p>
