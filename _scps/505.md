<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-505</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-505 is to be kept in a humidity controlled storage locker. A regular checkup of the item's surface is to be conducted every month, as well as its removal for maintenance.</p><p>Following this procedure, SCP-505 is to be returned to containment, and should be stored in a separate room.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-505 is a black-and-white photograph of the front page of The New York Times. The image depicts an unidentified woman in her mid twenties, dressed in what appears to be an off-the-shoulder dress with red writing on the right side of the garment. She is standing in front of a sunset; the image suggests that she was taking a photograph outside. On the left side are embossed the words “TODAY IN A NEW YORK MINUTE”. Despite being somewhat faded and torn, it is impossible to determine if any other text appears on the clothing.</p><p>SCP-505 exhibits no other anomalous properties.</p><p>Incident 505-1: On 14 August 1980, SCP-505 was contained in a storage locker owned by ██████ Public School. During its transfer, the locker door opened and a swarm of flies emerged from inside. Hallways were also observed to become unusually crowded due to the large number of flies that had arrived.</p><p>In order to halt this effect, as well as prevent further damages, Researcher Collins had to quarantine both school and locker room for over three hours while working on containing this incident. By 21:46, all flies had been destroyed using insecticide spray and SCP-505 was returned to containment.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On 7 October 1988, SCP-505 was temporarily removed from its locker. The following day, the school’s janitor reported that it had been found in a pile of trash near the school’s front doors. The area in question was fenced off due to potential hazardous materials (see Incident 505-2).</p><p>SCP-505 was then returned to its proper place of containment.</p><p><strong>Incident 505-2:</strong> On 13 October 1988, a man entered the school's front doors and attempted to enter the fenced off area around SCP-505. The man proceeded to tear down the fence and attempted to enter the room containing SCP-505. He was restrained by security personnel, who were alerted by a nearby videophone.</p><p>Security personnel attempted to restrain the man, but were unable to do so until backup arrived. Eventually a riot broke out, and upon arrival of local police the event was evacuated.</p><p>The following day, a large amount of newspapers with articles pertaining to the incident were found at the scene of the incident."]</p>
