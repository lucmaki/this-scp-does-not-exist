<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-31</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-31 is contained in a standard containment locker at Site-19. When not in use, it is to be kept in a temperature-controlled room with the lid closed at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-31 is a wooden racing dragon boat with the title "The One and Only Royal Dragon Boat" emblazoned on the bow and stern. The front of the boat bears the image of a pair of dragons with outstretched wings.</p><p>A 'key ring' key attached to a ring passed through the handle of the steering oar displays an inscription confirming that it is activated by pulling on the ring. When this is done, SCP-31 will immediately begin to move despite no physical propulsion from the user. In addition, any other mechanism or object used to achieve motion is rendered inert and ineffective in supplying propulsion for SCP-31. Said motion is entirely unaffected by wind, tide, current, or other forms of inertia or resistance.</p><p>It should be noted that although SCP-31 does not need mechanical assistance to move under its own power, it will move at a rate proportional to its speed when driven by a propeller created by any means other than pulling on the 'key ring'. Additionally, SCP-31 cannot be moved by [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>SCP-31 was recovered from a residential property in ██████████ following anomalous activity related to SCP-31. Agents embedded in local law enforcement were able to apprehend a group of five individuals believed to have been involved in the anomalous activity before further anomalous events could occur. Upon recovery, SCP-31 was not affected by gravitational anomalies present at both locations; however, upon being brought indoors, it jumped upwards slightly and rolled across the floor towards personnel stationed at least 60 meters away from it. This ability has been attributed to the gravitational anomaly present at its original location.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong> SCP-31 was found to be able to communicate in a manner consistent with the pop-culture dragon boat race in which it was first discovered. Messages were delivered through two methods.</p><p>The first was through the use of a series of standard dragon boat messages, such as "pass the hot sauce," "the tide is high," and "the boat is in the back." The second was by using the key ring to activate the phone on the back of SCP-31, which in turn caused it to deliver a series of calls to a number provided by personnel stationed outside of SCP-31\'s containment to listen in on.']</p>
