<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-311</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-311 is to be contained in a standard Safe containing locker at Site-77. Only personnel with Level 4 Security Clearance are permitted to handle SCP-311.</p><p>Personnel entering the containment area of SCP-311 are required to wear rubberized full body suits and/or face masks and must keep their hands away from the opening of SCP-311 while inside its containment area. Any staff entering the containment area of SCP-311 without appropriate protective precautions are to be reprimanded, then [REDACTED].</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-311 is a portable cremation urn made of red/maroon colored concrete. No markings are visible from outside the container, except for a warning label in English and Chinese reading:</p><p>WARNING</p><p>DANGER!</p><p>This object contains a very unstable and powerful energy source. Do not attempt to open this container under any circumstances. If it is opened the contents will explode violently, possibly killing anyone within a radius of 50 meters.</p><p>The containment area of SCP-311 consists of a steel door, two cameras with live monitoring, four air filters, and an incinerator located in the center of the room. The incinerator rests on top of an electromagnet which moves the incinerator platform once every twenty minutes. Two safes containing ceramic containers labeled "BURN VESSEL FOR REST OF YOUR LIVES" have been placed in the room as a precaution against unapproved opening of SCP-311.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
