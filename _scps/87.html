<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-87</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-87 is currently contained at Site-██, which has been expanded to accommodate the additional containment requirements of this object. Site-██ is also to contain a large swimming pool with over 6 meters of water. The perimeter of the pool is to be secured by a twenty meter high fence made up of barbed wire. Access to the site is only allowed during testing.</p><p>Several security cameras have been installed throughout the facility so that any changes in behavior can be observed and recorded. Samples of SCP-87 are stored in refrigerated storage units at Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-87 is a humanoid entity resembling a Caucasian male, standing at about 1.75 meters in height and weighing 90 kilograms. SCP-87 is able to assume any form it desires, at will. It has a feral appearance, with long fox-like ears and eyes that are capable of perceiving infrared light. SCP-87 is highly intelligent, but is also quite sociopathic and lacks the ability to feel emotions such as pain or fear.</p><p>SCP-87 will appear in public frequently, usually in the summer time when there is an abundance of tourists around. During this time, it will impersonate a human being (henceforth referred to as Subject-87) and will make conversation with individuals (ordinarily children) through means of sympathetic magic.</p><p>Subject-87 will attempt to convince the child to enter its house or car. When the subject does so, SCP-87 will order the vehicle to leave the area and go into a nearby deserted beach, park or forest (see testing log). The subject will arrive at their destination and witness SCP-87 transforming into the form of a large tan wolf-like creature with long hair and four limbs (henceforth referred to as SCP-87-1), which has been named "Zef", and mate with them (see test log).</p><p>Upon completion of mating, subjects have reported multiple instances of orgasm by SCP-87-1. This behavior is repeated on subjects as often as possible during their stay in the presence of SCP-87, although they have never physically interacted with Zef while under its effects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
