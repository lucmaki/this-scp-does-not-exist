<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-483</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-483 is located in the Mojave Desert, close to the city of Barstow. Three hours before sunrise, all civilians are ordered to leave the area designated for testing by D-Class personnel. During any testing of SCP-483, at least one D-Class must be present to supervise the Hazardous Materials team's cleaning and evacuation efforts.</p><p>A ten meter separation is maintained between the exterior of SCP-483 and any other structures. Any structure located within this distance is to be demolished as soon as possible if test results do not support its eventual removal.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-483 is a 2.5 meter wide, 5 meter long, and 20 meter deep indentation in the desert floor. The exact cause of SCP-483's formation is unknown. The existence of similar formations in different parts of the world leads researchers to believe that SCP-483 is an anomalous phenomenon caused by the global shift of tectonic plates during the late Cenozoic era.</p><p>The most obvious indication of this otherworldly origin is SCP-483's relative lack of physical properties: while its mass is estimated at 2.6 metric tonnes, it does not seem to possess any value desired by most engineers, since it cannot be detected with conventional instruments. It also has no apparent valence; for instance, it does not release electricity or produce heat as would be expected from its composition.</p><p>In addition, matter within SCP-483 does not interact with the laws of physics; items placed within SCP-483 and retrieved from an outside location show no anomalous effects such as levitation or movement. It appears to be able to withstand extreme temperatures without melting or burning and undergoes no observable change over time, nor does it exhibit any chemical processes such as electrolysis.</p><p>SCP-483 is extremely durable; albeit slightly radioactive, any human being attempting to take a sample or climb inside it will suffer radiation poisoning unless they are equipped with proton therapy machines that have been specifically built to treat this type of poisoning. (See Addendum 583-1.)</p><p>SCP-483's anomalous properties are only present within a 10 square meter radius around its center. If a structure (such as a building or car) is constructed within 1 km of SCP-483, tests performed on its interior will produce results consistent with the physical properties attributed to normal matter (e.g., gravity). After one year, materials will begin to show signs of aging at an accelerated rate unless removed from SCP-483 within 12 hours. Upon removal from SCP-483, all exposed materials will eventually lose all structural integrity, collapse into rubble and disintegrate into dust.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
