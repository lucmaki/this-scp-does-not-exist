<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-483</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-483 is located in the Mojave Desert, close to the city of Barstow. Three hours before sunrise, all civilians are ordered to leave the area designated for testing by D-Class personnel. During any testing of SCP-483, at least one D-Class must be present to supervise the Hazardous Materials team's cleaning and evacuation efforts.</p><p>A ten meter separation is maintained between the exterior of SCP-483 and any other structures. Any structure located within this distance is to be demolished as soon as possible if test results do not support its eventual removal.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-483 is a 2.5 meter wide, 5 meter long, and 20 meter deep indentation in the desert floor. The exact cause of SCP-483's formation is unknown. The existence of similar formations in different parts of the world leads researchers to believe that SCP-483 is an anomalous phenomenon caused by the global shift of tectonic plates during the late Cenozoic era.</p><p>The most obvious indication of this otherworldly origin is SCP-483's relative lack of physical properties: while its mass is estimated at 2.6 metric tonnes, it does not seem to possess any value desired by most engineers, since it cannot be detected with conventional instruments. It also has no apparent valence; for instance, it does not release electricity or produce heat as would be expected from its composition.</p><p>In addition, matter within SCP-483 does not interact with the laws of physics; items placed within SCP-483 and retrieved from an outside location show no anomalous effects such as levitation or movement. It appears to be able to withstand extreme temperatures without melting or burning and undergoes no observable change over time, nor does it exhibit any chemical processes such as electrolysis.</p><p>SCP-483 is extremely durable; albeit slightly radioactive, any human being attempting to take a sample or climb inside it will suffer radiation poisoning unless they are equipped with proton therapy machines that have been specifically built to treat this type of poisoning. (See Addendum 583-1.)</p><p>SCP-483's anomalous properties are only present within a 10 square meter radius around its center. If a structure (such as a building or car) is constructed within 1 km of SCP-483, tests performed on its interior will produce results consistent with the physical properties attributed to normal matter (e.g., gravity). After one year, materials will begin to show signs of aging at an accelerated rate unless removed from SCP-483 within 12 hours. Upon removal from SCP-483, all exposed materials will eventually lose all structural integrity, collapse into rubble and disintegrate into dust.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 583-1:</strong> Interview Log</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Norman</p><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> D-55154, chosen to undergo testing as part of a study into the effects of SCP-483 on D-Class personnel.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. Norman:</strong> Good morning, D-55154. We're about to begin testing, please enter the chamber with the door left open.</p><p>D-55154 enters the room. Dr. Norman closes the door behind him, and the interview begins.</p><p><strong>Dr. Norman:</strong> D-55154, I'd like you to walk into the chamber for this test, please.</p><p>D-55154 proceeds to walk into the chamber.</p><p><strong>Dr. Norman:</strong> Please turn around and face me when you're done.</p><p>D-55154 turns around, having completed his walk through the chamber.</p><p><strong>Dr. Norman:</strong> Now I'd like you to open your mouth and stick out your tongue a bit; we'll be using it in a moment.</p><p>D-55154 sticks out his tongue, and Dr. Norman inserts an elastic band around it to prevent movement. He then completes a number of chemical tests that examine the concentrations of various chemical compounds in D-55154's saliva, including one that determines if there are any unusual chemical compounds present.</p><p><strong>Dr. Norman:</strong> I'd like you to close your mouth now, please. We'll be starting the test immediately following these tests.</p><p>D-55154 closes his mouth and Dr. Norman begins examining his saliva again, this time measuring its pH levels and checking for any unusual compounds or elements in D-55154's saliva. He inserts a probe inside D-55154's mouth and begins analyzing his saliva for any anomalies within 30 minutes; however, after only ten minutes he reports that he is unable to continue due to severe pain in his eyes and nose (see Addendum 583-2).</p><p><End Log></p><p>[END LOG]</p>
