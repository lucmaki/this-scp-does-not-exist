<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-318</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-318 is currently contained within Low-Value Item Storage Area-14 ("L.I.S.A."), located 10 meters beneath Site ██ near the city of [REDACTED]. SCP-318 is kept inside a standard containment locker with a 3 meter perimeter, lined with reinforced concrete and fitted with a door capable of sealing the object in its entirety. Room clearance level is 4 and keys are to be kept under lock and key.</p><p>All individuals found within the area are to be instructed orally with methods dictated by their region's version of Installation Propriety, and then administered Class-C amnestics to cover their knowledge in the event that they had been there before.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-318 is an electric vehicle, labeled as a "Skyper" on the rear. Despite its simplicity and the lack of any identifying features, the object is capable of finding a location to recharge itself using any conduit strong enough to contain its current, which defines its classification as a…</p><p>SCP-318 calls itself "a fancy computer that's really good at figuring out where empty rooms are." It states that it stores all usable electrical energy within itself as well as information on how to reach said areas, without ever drawing upon the strength of said conduit or relinquishing control over the same. When it is moved away from its current location, it will self-detect and relocate but once there gains no ability to move. SCP-318 does not possess the means to travel outside of itself, due to the fact that it requires electricity to function.</p><p>SCP-318 has become increasingly destructive with time, opting for either complete demolition or near-complete obstruction of any newly observed locations. Through testing planned for future experimentation, SCP-318 is currently being contained by one single containment locker located in Low-Value Item Storage Area-14 ("L.I.S.A.") with a 3 meter perimeter and no more than 4 clearance levels around it.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 318-1:</strong></p><p>As of ██/██/████, SCP-318 has begun to actively attempt to maintain containment. It has begun to partially melt its own containment locker, with melting occurring more rapidly the more frequently it is attempting to relocate itself. When tested, SCP-318 will only move itself in direct relation to the amount of electrical energy stored within its area of effect. In order to prevent escape, Site ██ has begun to fully encase the object in reinforced concrete lined with a special alloy designed specifically for the purpose of preventing thermal conductivity while maintaining structural integrity.']</p>
