<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-318</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-318 is currently contained within Low-Value Item Storage Area-14 ("L.I.S.A."), located 10 meters beneath Site ██ near the city of [REDACTED]. SCP-318 is kept inside a standard containment locker with a 3 meter perimeter, lined with reinforced concrete and fitted with a door capable of sealing the object in its entirety. Room clearance level is 4 and keys are to be kept under lock and key.</p><p>All individuals found within the area are to be instructed orally with methods dictated by their region's version of Installation Propriety, and then administered Class-C amnestics to cover their knowledge in the event that they had been there before.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-318 is an electric vehicle, labeled as a "Skyper" on the rear. Despite its simplicity and the lack of any identifying features, the object is capable of finding a location to recharge itself using any conduit strong enough to contain its current, which defines its classification as a…</p><p>SCP-318 calls itself "a fancy computer that's really good at figuring out where empty rooms are." It states that it stores all usable electrical energy within itself as well as information on how to reach said areas, without ever drawing upon the strength of said conduit or relinquishing control over the same. When it is moved away from its current location, it will self-detect and relocate but once there gains no ability to move. SCP-318 does not possess the means to travel outside of itself, due to the fact that it requires electricity to function.</p><p>SCP-318 has become increasingly destructive with time, opting for either complete demolition or near-complete obstruction of any newly observed locations. Through testing planned for future experimentation, SCP-318 is currently being contained by one single containment locker located in Low-Value Item Storage Area-14 ("L.I.S.A.") with a 3 meter perimeter and no more than 4 clearance levels around it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
