<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-239</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-239 is located in a secure containment facility. No personnel are permitted to enter the chamber due to its volatile nature. As of today, all research within SCP-239 has been suspended, pending an investigation into the source of the phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-239 is a standard, reinforced concrete bomb shelter located in the [REDACTED] city of ████████. Although SCP-239 has been entered by personnel on several occasions, it appears to be inaccessible and impassable, even when using all methods of entry (including demagnetizing the steel door and opening through the reinforced concrete walls). The interior of the shelter contains conventional furnishings and equipment.</p><p>The only anomalous properties of SCP-239 are that each attempt to enter the shelter via conventional means results in one's body being rapidly deformed and disintegrated; also, a faint hum can be heard throughout its interior. Despite this, when attempting to enter by artificial means, no effect is observed. After five minutes inside SCP-239, any subject will emerge in the vicinity of a nearby city with none of their bodily functions remaining intact. Human remains removed from SCP-239 have turned out to contain heavily irradiated material, along with stem cell-based regenerative capabilities.</p><p>SCP-239 was discovered following [DATA EXPUNGED] involving [DATA EXPUNGED]. In order to prevent another [DATA EXPUNGED], Agents were deployed to find the source of the anomaly; however, during transport, it exploded. When the Agents reached ground zero, they found two bullet casings in close proximity to the wreckage of an abandoned armored truck. The casings were identical to those found at [DATA EXPUNGED]. It took ███ hours to clear away all affected materials.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 239-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, Dr. ████ was tasked with studying SCP-239. She was placed inside the chamber and monitored for three hours. Her body disintegrated at the end of the experiment and did not return to its original form. Following this test, all personnel are now advised to wear protective gear when entering SCP-239.']</p>
