<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-339</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-339 is presently contained on a heavily guarded research facility. SCP-339 samples and all documentation related to the object are to be kept within this facility at all times. Any personnel wishing to study or work with SCP-339 are required to undergo an interview with Level 4 clearance or higher in order to establish an acceptable level of risk.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-339 is a large, square, stone tool approximately 1.5m in size. The object has a flat face approximately 2cm thick, with the edges being irregular and sharpened slightly. The edge of the object is coated in a black substance. Analysis has shown that this substance is composed of organic materials and fluids; in tests, it has been determined to be blood and ash from plant matter. Its origin is currently unknown.</p><p>SCP-339-1 are images and words carved into SCP-339 along its edge; from what it appears to be, SCP-339-1 is mostly concerning working plants, but also includes some crudely drawn portraits of animal specimens and figures, based on the subject's memory and understanding of their appearance at the time. Several instances of SCP-339-1 seem to indicate apparent dates of work over time, although it appears that these dates were not recorded accurately.</p><p>There have been no reports of SCP-339 affecting any living objects or humans save for those directly involved in its creation and use. However, testing has shown that all personnel who have had contact with SCP-339 will experience an intense thirst after leaving the facility that goes unquenched until they exit the building. A moderate amount of analysis has suggested that SCP-339 may affect those who did not directly handle the object in any way, although this theory has not yet been tested due to complications arising from testing with live human subjects.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Interview Log 339-1</p><p><strong>Interview Log:</strong> SCP-339</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. ██████</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ███████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. ██████ was diagnosed with a serious sinus infection, and requested permission to join SCP-339 research as part of his recovery.</p><p><Begin log></p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Uh, hi, okay? How can I help you today?</p><p>Dr. ██████ is directed into an empty room. He takes a seat in front of an interview table and waits for further instructions.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Right, well… so, like, what exactly do you need from me? What are you looking to find out about the object?</p><p>Dr. ██████ is directed to remove his shoes and wait for further instructions. He does as instructed and stands up, holding his feet to prevent them from touching the floor.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Right, so-</p><p>Dr. ██████ is instructed to stand on the table, upon which he does so. He looks up at Dr. ███████, who stands nearby and watches him intently. He looks back down at his shoes and demonstrates a slight twitch of his foot. He then lightly jiggles his testicles and toes in a repetitive motion, then looks back up at Dr. ███████ who gives him a nod.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> So, uh… can I go now? I really need to get to work on my sinuses…</p><p>Dr. ██████ is shown to the door by security personnel and leaves nervously, scratching the back of his head as he enters the hallway outside the room.</p><p><End log></p><p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Dr. ██████ has left Foundation employment due to the return of his sinusitis; although he is currently under medical care in order to recover completely, he is still capable of performing Foundation duties.']</p>
