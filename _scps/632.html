<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-632</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-632 is currently contained at Site-77 in the secure area of SCP Item Testing Wing. Personnel assigned to SCP-632 are to be kept away from any unsecured artwork, and have been made aware that they will be terminated if they attempt to display 632 outside of a secure area. The viewport in which the item is contained has been modified to prevent any direct visual contact with SCP-632.</p><p>SCP-632 has been marked as being used in testing that must not be recorded on any level of security below clearance 4.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-632 is an artwork, currently owned and kept by Site-77. It consists of a sheet of white paper, slightly smaller than A3 size, with a black monochrome ink drawing in the center of the page. The drawing resembles a black-and-white photograph from an early camera, showing what appears to be a male humanoid in motion. The main figure is moving in a "sprinting" motion, though it has no visible feet or legs.</p><p>Upon first being presented to the Foundation, SCP-632 has been positioned at various points in the facility for testing. The item can be moved about freely within testing chambers without attracting hostile attention; however, personnel assigned to SCP-632 have reported that they always feel compelled to stay near it.</p><p>No adverse effects have been observed from exposure to SCP-632 so far. Testing on personnel assigned to SCP-632 is currently prohibited.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
