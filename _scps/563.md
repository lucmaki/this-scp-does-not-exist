<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-563</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The perimeter of the habitat of SCP-563 consists of a fence made of barbed wire and two security guards at all times. No more than two individuals are allowed in the habitat at any given time. Any person attempting to leave the habitat is to be quickly removed by one of the security guards. If necessary, a tranquilizer dart may be used on an individual within the habitat for non-emergency transport. All persons found in the habitat without authorization will be detained and questioned.</p><p>Members of MTF Pi-27 have been assigned to identify new individuals in the habitat, as well as retrieve any individuals who have attempted to exit or contact outside entities via radio. Information has also been collected on other sites where black caribou have been seen, including:</p><p>To date, no evidence has emerged that SCP-563 itself is capable of communicating, but Site 79 believes it is possible. Efforts are currently underway to locate and capture SCP-563-1 instances before they leave the site to prevent their escape.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-563 is a small, uninhabited island off the northwest coast of mainland Canada. Due to its remote location, little research has been conducted on SCP-563. The following information is based on the notes kept by Site 79 staff.</p><p>SCP-563 appears to be an uninhabited island composed primarily of black rock and ice, but several long paths of grass have been found leading across the island's northern side. These paths are narrow enough to fit one person at a time, and are usually only wide enough for one or two persons to walk abreast. The grass is perpetually frozen due to SCP-563's cold climate, allowing it to remain intact.</p><p>The grass itself appears to be black in color, and features a texture that appears similar to hair. No animals have been observed living in the grass; however, it has been theorized that SCP-563 may have existed since prehistoric times when cavemen came here to hunt black caribou (SCP-563-1 instances).</p><p>Several groups of black caribou have been spotted near the edges of SCP-563's perimeter fence, most likely escaping from nearby forests via SCP-563. A total of five SCP-563-1 instances have been discovered so far:</p><p>A security camera covering a large piece of land surrounding SCP-563 has recorded footage in which two human figures can be seen approaching SCP-563 and entering one of the paths through the grass. No further evidence has emerged indicating that these individuals belong to any government agency or military organization. They were reported missing by their spouses during this period.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On March 19th, 2008, MTF Pi-27 was sent to collect SCP-563-1 instances and return them to Site 79. Due to the remote location of SCP-563 and the possible existence of other SCP-563-1 instances, several members of Pi-27 were equipped with tranquilizer darts and other non-lethal weaponry. The following is a transcript of radio communications between Site 79 and Pi-27.</p><p><strong>Site 79:</strong> Contact has been made with two black caribou. We'll be ready in 20 minutes.</p><p><strong>Pi-27:</strong> Confirmed. We're ready.</p><p><strong>Site 79:</strong> What are your feelings on capturing them alive?</p><p><strong>Pi-27:</strong> It's not our job to take care of any wildlife we find. And this isn't wildlife. This is a threat to our security and we need to neutralize it.</p><p><strong>Site 79:</strong> Hold position. We'll need to determine what kind of creature it is before we can proceed with the capture.</p><p><strong>Pi-27:</strong> Roger that.</p><p><strong>Site 79:</strong> Black caribou… eh… eh… eh… I don't have anything for that.</p><p><strong>Pi-27:</strong> Just… say it again?</p><p><strong>Site 79:</strong> Black caribou… eh… eh… eh…</p><p><strong>Pi-27:</strong> (mumbling) Are you sure there aren't any black caribou on this island?</p><p><strong>Site 79:</strong> Black caribou… why are you asking us about black caribou? You see them, don't you? You see them come in here, don't you? You see them go out, don't you? I'm telling you, black caribou are coming into this island! And we need to capture those things and then send them back home. They might be dangerous too, you know! They might be really dangerous!</p><p><strong>Pi-27:</strong> I just want to know if they're black or not…</p><p><strong>Site 79:</strong> Yes, they're black—get a picture!</p><p><strong>Pi-27:</strong> We'll get a picture when we capture one—okay? Alright. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it all figured out, huh? Alright, thanks for the advice. (muttering) Shithead won't listen to me—we'll get one, alright? Alright. Got it. Follow up with him after we've captured one of those things.</p><p>After Pi-27 proceeded with their mission, Site 79 reported the capture of a black caribou (SCP-563-1a) in their area."]</p>
