<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-917</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-917 is kept in a standard containment cell. The cell itself is to be kept at least 1 meter from all other objects, and the floor should be covered with non-porous material such as ceramic tile. SCP-917's security door should remain locked at all times, preventing any possible unauthorized access. Aside from physical contact, no other objects are allowed within 1 meter of SCP-917. SCP-917 should be periodically checked for signs of contamination or damage. Any found signs should be reported to the researchers assigned to SCP-917.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-917 is a silver football measuring approximately 1 m in diameter. SCP-917 exhibits no signs of deterioration and has not changed since its arrival on Site-██ in 2009. SCP-917's surface is smooth, as if it were polished, but it is as hard as any other solid material. The only markings SCP-917 possesses are a series of numbers written in black ink. These numbers correspond to the position of the player for one of the teams participating in the [REDACTED] game. An appropriate player (agent or otherwise) takes a place at each location marked with a number, and attempts to touch the ball at that location once the ball has been moved there by the caster of SCP-917.</p><p>The object will move from team to team, randomly selecting a place for each player. Each time a place is selected, the ball will be activated for 5 seconds, and carries no anomalous properties; however, it appears as though an invisible entity is moving the ball and acting as though it is handling it. Once released, SCP-917 will hit any part of a player that has been designated by the number printed on SCP-917's surface. While causality has yet to be determined, direct contact with SCP-917 causes minor discomfort to all players involved while they remain in contact. This discomfort is usually mild enough to pass off with little difficulty.</p><p>If a player touches the ball while activation is still active while they are outside their own team's area of representation on SCP-917's surface, they are transported to a randomly chosen location within Site-██'s containment area 1 kilometre away from where their designated player stood originally; this transport point can be modified through testing (See Addendum 917A). Players affected by these transports are not able to see where or when they are being taken until they arrive at their destination point, although some of them were able to recall images from past events causing these transports, including incidents that occurred long before their life histories began.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 917A:</strong> Testing has revealed that this effect is not limited to players who are currently involved in a game of [REDACTED]; players from both teams were transported to locations within Site-██'s containment area. As with the original testing, these transports caused no discomfort to the players."]</p>
