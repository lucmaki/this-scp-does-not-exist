<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-516</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-516 is kept in an underground Containment Locker at Site-██, to protect SCP-516 from accidental exposure. No personnel involved with research and testing on SCP-516 are to be informed of the nature of SCP-516.</p><p>Researcher personnel assigned to SCP-516 are to meet with a medical doctor before beginning work on SCP-516 for a complete examination of any and all pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-516 is a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe on the day of her death. SCP-516 is completely unremarkable save for its anomalous properties, and uses the same materials and techniques as similar dresses manufactured in Monroe's time. SCP-516 has not been altered since Monroe's death; it is not possible to open or alter SCP-516 in any way.</p><p>When an individual wearing SCP-516 attempts to wear another dress, they experience a powerful and seemingly irrational compulsion to wear it. The compulsion is so powerful that individuals will often use extreme force against themselves, breaking bones or tearing muscle tissue before removing the other dress and taking up SCP-516 again. More rarely, individuals may insist on cutting off their own arms or legs before being persuaded otherwise.</p><p>SCP-516 was discovered in the attic of Monroe's final residence on ██████ Avenue, Los Angeles, CA after extensive research into the life of Marilyn Monroe revealed that she died wearing it. It is unknown how long Monroe had possessed SCP-516 prior to her death, but several items belonging to her were also found in the attic, including several scrapbooks containing pictures and brief biographies of Monroe's acquaintances as well as detailed accounts of her life.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
