<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-204</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation maintains a cover identity for SCP-204, "Marriott's". Contact with this organization is not permitted. Any information gained from the Foundation is to be exchanged with the Marriott's personnel in person and on paper only. In the event of accidental exposure, class 4 amnestics are to be administered before any efforts to conceal knowledge of SCP-204 from the public eye may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-204 is a set of twelve adult human males, designated SCP-204-A through SCP-204-I. To date, SCP-204 have been discovered in postal facilities throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The names on the front of the individuals' identification cards match their vocal experience. A recorded audio cassette tape is always located within the mail (postmarked from ████, NY and labeled "SECRET"). The attached cover note bears no address and requests that the recipient call them when they arrive.</p><p>When a human male adheres to one of these criteria, he will receive a phone call from an identifying voice matching his vocal experience. They will then proceed to follow all normal procedures for a hotel guest and order anything that has not already been taken care of by the Marriott's staff. Everything will be delivered to their room, regardless of whether it is requested or not.</p><p>SCP-204 have been known to leave their hotel rooms periodically throughout the duration of their stay in order to complete other tasks at request of the caller, such as delivering packages to others and checking in on maintenance workers who are securing an area while they are out. Each individual with whom they have interacted has shown interest in their presence and will leave them with a copy of a book entitled "The Twelve Part Harmony". This book is written by [DATA EXPUNGED], a person who resides within the confines of SCP-204's containment unit.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is an excerpt from the book "The Twelve Part Harmony" by [DATA EXPUNGED]:</p><p>The number twelve is a perfect number. It\'s divisible by two, three, four, and six. It\'s the most perfect number because it\'s the sum of the first eleven perfect numbers; and it\'s the first perfect number that can be represented as the difference between any two perfect numbers. For example:</p><p>(11 + 12 = 13)</p><p>(one - nine = zero)</p><p>(two - one = one)</p><p>(three - one = two)</p><p>(four - two = five)</p><p>(five - three = seven)</p><p>And so on.</p><p>In fact, every positive integer is a perfect number. They\'re all produced by adding together consecutive numbers in sequence. Here are some examples:</p><p>4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22, which is divisible by 2 and 3, and also by 2 and 4.</p><p>7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 35 (which is also divisible by 3), both because 35 divides 22 and because 35 is the difference between 22 and 23.</p><p>5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 70 (which is also divisible by 4).</p><p>13 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3</p><p>and so on.</p><p>It\'s no coincidence that the perfect numbers are all multiples of thirteen. Take a look at this list:</p><p>1, 13, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 100, 102, 104, 108, 109, 111… (and so on)…</p><p>That\'s right! The first ten perfect numbers are all multiples of thirteen! One plus thirteen equals fourteen. Two plus thirteen equals sixteen. Three plus thirteen equals eighteen. Four plus thirteen equals twenty-two. And so on. All perfect numbers are multiples of thirteen! Nothing could be more perfectly beautiful than that!</p><p>Now let\'s talk about the perfect harmony…</p><p>The Twelve Part Harmony</p>
