<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-456</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-456 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment room, furnished with a table and chair. SCP-456 instances are not to be allowed to remain for more than 24 hours without a staff member being present.</p><p>All incoming correspondence from SCP-456 is to be immediately destroyed by incineration. Any documents or images produced by SCP-456 are to be disposed of as soon as possible using the techniques documented in SCP-1104.</p><p>Any personnel assigned to SCP-456 should be pre-screened for mental illness and/or history of drug abuse. Personnel who have been affected by SCP-456 should undergo treatment following standard Foundation psychological evaluation protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-456 is the designation given to a collective of individuals who display symptoms consistent with anomalous psychopathology. Instances of SCP-456 are typically socially inept, impulsive, and restless.</p><p>While SCP-456 instances exhibit the same abnormality across all age groups and genders, certain personality traits can be anticipated by studying individual cases. While several details remain unknown about the specific causes of these attributes, it is believed that they are innate and not affected by other psychological or medical conditions (see Addendum).</p><p>Because of their low intelligence and repetitive behavior, SCP-456 instances will spend most of their time idly playing games or watching television. However, they may become devastated when they are unable to achieve a goal they set for themselves (see Addendum). Examples of such goals include:</p><p>An SCP-456 instance also tends to feel a sense of pride over any accomplishment (i.e., winning at chess).</p><p>SCP-1104 describes the procedures for destroying documents produced by an SCP-456 instance.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-456 was discovered in ██████, Ohio when a man named ██████ ████████ was brought in for evaluation by the Foundation. When questioned, ██████ ████████ claimed to have no knowledge of who he was, how he came to be in his current state, how SCP-456 had affected him, or why he could not remember anything prior to being approached by the Foundation. After being administered Class A amnestics and released from Foundation custody, ██████ ████████ was able to provide more information about his unusual condition.</p><p>The following is an in-depth account of the events that led to SCP-456's discovery.</p><p>On ██/██/201██, ████████ was taken to the ███████ Medical Center due to an asthma attack. While under anesthetics, a member of staff noticed a small scar on his left arm that had not been previously noticed. As part of standard medical procedures, all personnel were given the opportunity to examine the wound.</p><p>Under questioning, ██████ ████████ admitted that he had accidentally inflicted this injury on himself. He then proceeded to describe how he had done this while he was under the influence of hallucinogens and/or narcotics. He also described another scar on his right arm as well as several cigarette burns on other parts of his body.</p><p>After further questioning, ██████ ████████ described an incident that took place while he was working as a security guard at a local grocery store. While patrolling the parking lot and checking for any suspicious activity in the vicinity, ████████ had encountered a man stealing a box of cornflakes. After informing the offender of his actions and issuing a brief warning, ██████ became aware that the man had been walking away from him and toward the store entrance without responding.</p><p>Upon hearing this, ██████ ran toward the man and tackled him before he could exit the building. Before he could ask for identification, however, SCP-456-1 manifested itself and violently attacked him with a pair of scissors. The victim of SCP-456-1's assault sustained severe lacerations on his head and face as well as several broken ribs and severe bruising on his chest and stomach.</p><p>After receiving treatment from emergency personnel on-site, SCP-456-1 attempted to flee from the scene but was promptly detained by ██████ ████████ who returned with a colleague (see Addendum). After being apprehended by Foundation personnel, SCP-456-1 subsequently admitted that it was under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs at the time of its crime (see Addendum).</p><p>This incident was officially recorded as an anomalous assault/homicidal event and classified as SCP-456."]</p>
