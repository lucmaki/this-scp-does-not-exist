<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-463</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-463 must be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. The interior of the containment cell is to be covered with steel and concrete. SCP-463 may be permitted to eat once per week since it requires no sustenance. Standard Humanoid psychological testing is required for SCP-463.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-463 is a male human with long red hair and blue eyes. SCP-463 appears to be 27 years of age in its natural state, although any records of this individual have been expunged from the historical record.</p><p>SCP-463 will attempt to escape from its containment cell approximately once per week, sometimes attempting to use means for escape not available to it. SCP-463 will immediately cease activity if it is forcibly removed from its cell.</p><p>SCP-463 can communicate with humans by means of telepathy. When this occurs, SCP-463 will display the following personality and behavior pattern:</p><p>When interacting with humans, SCP-463 will attempt to persuade them to cooperate in the goals it has set for itself. In order to accomplish these goals, SCP-463 will attempt to convince the humans that they are acting irrationally, and that they need not be concerned with the modern world.</p><p>Should a human refuse or fail to cooperate with SCP-463, it will attempt to convince the people involved that they are going insane and need psychiatric care. These attempts are entirely successful; thus far all attempts by SCP-463 to persuade this group of humans have succeeded in their goal of being given psychotherapy and medication. After undergoing therapy and/or medication, these humans exhibit completely normal behavior until they leave their home base and are then replaced by new subjects for SCP-463.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On 8/20/09, a human female, who was the primary subject of SCP-463, was terminated via gunshot wound to the head. The gun that fired this shot was found to be registered to Dr. ████████. The gun had not been fired in five years.</p><p>After the murder, SCP-463 ceased its attempts to persuade humans to cooperate with it. It has not attempted to escape since. It is still located at Site-19.</p>
