<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-950</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-950 is to be kept in a climate-controlled chamber at its site of discovery, with no more than three (3) standard test subjects in at a time. The temperature of the chamber is to be maintained at 12 degrees Celsius.</p><p>When not under investigation, subjects that have interacted with SCP-950 are to be kept on a diet of water and non-perishable foods. Any type of SCP-950 exposure is to be dealt with as rapidly as possible by dousing the subject with water after its effects expire. It is understood that exposure to SCP-950 will continue during a controlled return to normal conditions.</p><p>SCP-950 has been sealed into a chamber equipped for destructive testing at Site-21. Any modifications made to this chamber are to be approved by a Level 2 staff member.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-950 is a humanoid figure of indeterminate gender, 16.5 meters in height, covered in a thick layer of frost and ice. SCP-950 possesses a beard and the ability to project clouds of frozen droplets from its eyes, which it can use as weapons.</p><p>Subjects that have interacted with SCP-950 (hereafter referred to as "test subjects") report that they experience extreme cold and numbness throughout their body as well as blurred vision. In some cases, test subjects report having difficulty breathing.</p><p>The effects of SCP-950 appear to be acute physical discomfort if the subject remains within an environment where it is present for more than five minutes at a time. Extended exposure causes the subject's veins to freeze over and leave them unable to move. Slightly less severe effects occur if the subject is exposed repeatedly over a longer period of time.</p><p>SCP-950 appears not to be affected by its own effect beyond minor disorientation or moments of confusion. Testing has shown that objects and organisms are unaffected by SCP-950's effect.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 950-1:</strong> SCP-950 was discovered in its current state after a report from a Foundation response team was suppressed by the local civilian police. Following this, SCP-950's effects were discovered when a local farmer reported his wife had fallen ill after being exposed to SCP-950. The farmer, who had been a member of the local police force, reported that he was instructed to take no action after the incident and was subsequently reprimanded.</p><p>The Foundation responded by setting up a covert operation to capture SCP-950 and relocate it outside Foundation control. After several days of surveillance, SCP-950 was successfully captured and contained within a chamber at Site-21.</p>
