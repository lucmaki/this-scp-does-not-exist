<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-465</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation's anomalous presence in the American states of New Hampshire and Vermont is to remain secret. Public knowledge of the existence of SCP-465 is to be suppressed; attempts are to be made to prevent the spread of information regarding its existence through the use of disinformation campaigns and media blackouts.</p><p>All official records relating to events within SCP-465-1 are to be expunged from official archives. The exact location and current status of SCP-465-1 are currently under investigation by Council 14.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-465 is a phenomenon affecting a rural area of New Hampshire (designated SCP-465-1) via anomalous means. SCP-465-1 was originally discovered on ██/██/1995, following reports from local civilians claiming that military equipment had been delivered to the town only to disappear again, and seeing similar equipment secreted away by uniformed personnel.</p><p>Records of the state and national governments indicate that nothing unusual has occurred within SCP-465-1 since 1995, or at all. Attempts to investigate further have consistently failed; Foundation agents assigned to the area have found reason to be ejected from the town on sight, with all relevant information and evidence confiscated.</p><p>Occurrences of SCP-465 also include:</p><p>These phenomena were categorized as merely anomalous upon discovery, but were not specifically attributable to any known anomaly. They were classified as "prophecies" until approximately ██/██/2010, when photographs began circulating on internet forums of a "strange metallic object hovering above an abandoned factory in Eagle Harbor, New Hampshire." An investigation team arrived at the scene and encountered similar manifestations of SCP-465, including the following:</p><p>Following this incident it was determined that all photographs were legitimate. A Foundation research team was sent to investigate containment of SCP-465, which was found in a storage facility within Site 4. Further investigation revealed that it was being kept within its original packaging without alteration. The package was opened and examined under ultraviolet light; written on one side was "This is only for you." When questioned about its origins, personnel indicated that they had neither given nor sold it to anyone else, and claimed ownership over it despite having no clear knowledge of where it originated from.</p><p>On ██/██/2011, an incident occurred during testing involving an albino D-class personnel and a small population of self-replicating robots controlled by Dr. ██████'s own design. A previously unknown program running on these robots (dubbed "Autonomous Practical Application") caused two modified devices designed specifically for investigating SCP objects (designated "LINCs") to experimentally manifest themselves within human hosts.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> The first LINC was discovered on ██/██/2011, in the arm of D-406336. The second was discovered on ██/██/2011, in the head of Dr. ██████'s daughter. Both were found to be functional, and were removed from their respective hosts immediately after discovery.</p><p>Upon discovery, both devices were tested for functionality; the LINC detected a high level of anomalous activity originating from SCP-465-1, which was confirmed by Foundation personnel stationed within the town. Further testing was undertaken to ascertain the extent of this anomaly.</p><p>The following is a transcription of the audio recording made by a LINC in ██/██/2011. All other anomalous activity present during this time has been redacted.</p><p>What the fuck is going on here? Why is it whispering in my ear? What's happening? What's happening there? What's happening? What's happening?</p><p>It's getting louder. It's getting louder and louder and louder! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body! I can't move my body!</p><p>I'm going to scream, but I don't know why. I don't know why anymore, but I think that's what it wants. It wants me to scream. It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream! It wants me to scream!</p><p>I'm going to do it now — whatever it is that it wants. But then — Oh God — what is it? What is it doing? What is it doing? What is it doing? Oh God, oh God — what is it doing? What is it doing?!</p><p>I'm going to do what it wants. Whatever it is that it wants. Whatever it is that it wants. Whatever it is that it — Oh God — oh God, oh God — what is it?! What is — oh God —</p>
