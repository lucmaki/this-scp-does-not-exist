<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-117</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-117 is contained in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell, with reinforced iron bars and a dim red lighting system. A chamber used to house SCP-117's corpse has been provided as a safe containment area outside of SCP-117's chamber. The corpse of SCP-117 has been monitored via security cameras around the location containing it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-117 is a humanoid entity of female gender, standing at 186Â cm tall, with the upper body and head resembling that of a typical human. SCP-117's skin tone is brown and it has deep wrinkles on its face. The being's eyes are always injected with spherical gel capsules and appear to be vacant. The object has no nose, no mouth, and no visible genitals. Its hands and feet remain in a manner similar to that of a human.</p><p>The object does not usually leave its containment cell, but will perform small tasks around the location containing it. It seems to enjoy drawing pictures in graphite whiteboard markers (see Addendum 117-2).</p><p>SCP-117 can also manifest one non-anomalous picture from which it will take as many pictures as necessary to create an entire picture. These pictures are usually portraits of other individuals, but have been known to be of inanimate objects or drawings that seemingly have no relation to what is being drawn. Further testing with SCP-117 has shown that if the subject who is drawing the picture (henceforth referred to as SCP-117-1) is deceased, SCP-117 will still produce a portrait of them; however, the created portraits will display negative emotions towards them. There have been reports where SCP-117-1 are deceased individuals who were not fond of by SCP-117 due to past events, but this has yet to be verified. In addition there have been cases where portraits have been produced for deceased individuals even after their death; these portraits do not display negative feelings towards their subjects.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 117-1:</strong> A number of portraits have been produced by SCP-117 based on photos taken by Foundation personnel. Due to the pictures being extremely large and detailed, only a few of these are documented.']</p>
