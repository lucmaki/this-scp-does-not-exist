<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-25</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The island of ████████████ is to remain evacuated and closed to human entry until the following conditions are met:</p><p>1. An approximate ten mile radius around the object's location must be classified as a hazard zone with no electromagnetic interference. This zone should be mined in the event of a containment breach, to prevent unauthorized navigation of the area.</p><p>2. A group of at least five (5) trained Foundation field agents should be present on the island at all times, with twenty (20) additional assets stationed at nearby sites to be mobilized if necessary. Any civilian communications with SCP-25 must be traced and shut down.</p><p>3. Any anomalous object entering or exiting the zone containing SCP-25 must be contained within a lead-lined shipping container at all times, and cannot leave the containment area under any circumstances. Containment vessels must have a minimum four (4) meter air-filled containment compartment, and shipments containing SCP-25 are to be sent from site-19 rather than from the site itself.</p><p>4. The majority of Foundation assets stationed at sites near SCP-25 are to remain on high alert for both biological organisms and anomalous objects within its vicinity, but this is not considered a direct threat to containment of SCP-25 by other means.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-25 is an entity with the appearance of a large, vaguely bipedal reptile. SCP-25 has several appendages which appear to be "arms", but these extend from the back and not from the shoulder as is typical of similar entities. SCP-25 is hostile to all personnel, but has shown no ability or desire to attack or harm humans in any way given its scale, how much it depends on them for sustenance and how little it can really hurt them within its area of effect.</p><p>SCP-25 appears to be omnivorous, but often feeds most heavily on the flesh and blood of humans, particularly those with a high caloric intake and increased stress levels. Its diet also includes other sea life, such as fish, shellfish and small invertebrates. It seems to prefer human blood over other types of food, possibly due to its suffering tolerance or reduced macrophage activity, but this preference does not seem to affect its ability to obtain nutrition from other sources.</p><p>SCP-25 actively hunts and consumes marine life until that food source is depleted, then moves to new hunting grounds. Noncorporeal entities such as SCP-27 will continue to hunt for SCP-25 based on its location until it is destroyed by any means.</p><p>SCP-25 cannot move towards or out of the hazard zone described above, even if it leaves the area around its containment vessel. Attempts to escort SCP-25 away from the area have had no permanent effect on its movement patterns (see Incident 25-01). SCP-25 is able to interrupt radio transmissions or shut down surveillance devices through anomalous means, but this has only been observed in combat situations, when SCP-25's aggressive behavior toward human beings would almost certainly lead it to attack first rather than try to escape.</p><p>Two instances of SCP-25 are currently contained at Site 19: one brought in at 15:58 hours GMT (06:58 PDT) on ██/██/1989 by [DATA EXPUNGED], the other secured on ██/██/90 by Agent ████████ and Agent ██████ after a battle against both undersea wildlife and a large quantity of armed civilians. Both instances were contained with minimal damage; however incidents tending toward combat have resulted in more substantial damages inflicted upon both instances over time.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Incident 25-01</p><p>On ██/██/89, SCP-25 and a large group of civilian divers had gone missing after several days of searching. A small research vessel, the "James Cook", was commissioned to search for them by Foundation agents stationed near the island. The government vessel found the maverick group on ██/██/89 and attempted to assist them in locating the object.</p><p>The object had moved away from the hunting grounds and swam further out to sea, and had not responded to radio calls. The divers were able to locate SCP-25 with their own equipment, but when they attempted to approach it, it attacked them with a non-anomalous trident.</p><p>The divers were forced to retreat and call for aid. After the Foundation secured the area, SCP-25 approached the ship again, but this time it did not attack. SCP-25 instead began conversing with one of the divers, who identified himself as "Sam Southward", and showed extreme interest in the ship\'s radio equipment. When asked why it was displaying such behavior, SCP-25 did not respond, but instead began to bark loudly at the ship.</p><p>Agent ████████ and Agent ██████ boarded the ship and attempted to speak with SCP-25, who responded by attacking them with its trident. When Agent ████████ attempted to subdue SCP-25 with a lead-lined plastic container, SCP-25 immediately broke the container in half and began devouring her flesh and blood. SCP-25 then used its trident to stab Agent ████████ through the back of her neck, killing her instantly.</p><p>SCP-25 then attempted to devour Agent ██████ with its "arms", but these appendages apparently lack sufficient dexterity to be useful for human consumption (See Incident 25-09).</p><p>The incident resulted in an immediate lockdown at Site 19, with all Foundation assets except for MTF Gamma-4 being withdrawn from the area. Both instances of SCP-25 were contained using standard containment procedures that had been in place since 1989; however, due to the injuries sustained by both instances during their initial confrontation with Foundation assets, the containment of both instances required more resources than usual.</p><p>To date, this is considered to be the most aggressive behavior displayed by SCP-25 within containment.']</p>
