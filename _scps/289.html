<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-289</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-289 are to be tracked by Foundation agents embedded within the Federal Reserve. Agents are to be covertly located in the Federal Reserve's New York, Atlanta and St. Louis branches at all times. The exact location of each instance is to be kept secret from the public at large. Instances of SCP-289 are subject to a unique policy of secrecy wherein its existence is only known to three levels of personnel:</p><p>Any information released outside these three groups must be approved by the Central Bank Liaison Officer (CBLO) and/or the Assistant Director for Research and Development (ADD).</p><p>A Foundation web site has been set up dedicated to tracking SCP-289 instances and monitoring the price of gold at various exchange rates.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-289 is a subset of gold bars limited to being saved by the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Instances of SCP-289 are almost exclusively stocked in the vaults of these banks, although there have been reports of their hidden in locations as far away as Switzerland and Hong Kong.</p><p>Each instance of SCP-289 is stamped with one or two serial numbers, which are matched to an unregistered gold bar of identical appearance. Only one means that each SCP-289 instance is part of a pair and one means that each SCP-289 is part of a set. The Federal Reserve on its website maintains a database of these serial numbers, which are also matched to unregistered bars.</p><p>Each SCP-289 has the same weight and golden color as its registered counterpart, but more importantly exhibits different characteristics from its counterparts. Allowing for minor variances due to preservation techniques, all SCP-289 instances depict similar and specific visual aspects including:</p><p>Specifications for each serial number within an instance show minor differences in weight, color or other characteristics consistent with slight variances in each bar's production run. However there are significant differences between every denomination within an instance. As an example, one hundred British sovereigns would be composed of approximately twenty ounces (five grams) while a single example of Guernsey would weigh approximately three hundred pounds (one hundred kilograms). A single pound would therefore be composed of approximately 1 billion ounces while a single ounce would contain nearly 15 trillion pounds.</p><p>SCP-289 was first discovered in 1982 when the Bank of England announced that it had withdrawn an identical amount it had previously received from the Federal Reserve and was subsequently sealed in 5and two thirds cubic feet (1metric ton) wooden crates containing 10gold bars at each location with serial numbers matching those on the Bank's vault. The Federal Reserve reacted quickly, quietly transferring the stored gold to various locations around Manhattan before transferring them to vaults across the country via freight train with staff only knowing that their shipment contained what were believed to be gold bars.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 289-01:</strong> On the evening of April 4, 1984, the Bank of England announced that it had discovered a discrepancy in its reserve holdings. The Bank stated that it had discovered that the Federal Reserve had reneged on a promise to return some of the gold it was holding and was now demanding a refund. The Bank of England refused this and instead proposed a compromise whereby it would be allowed to return an equal amount in exchange for allowing the Federal Reserve to keep the gold. This proposal was rejected by the Federal Reserve and on April 5, 1984 the Bank of England announced that it would be making an announcement at 5:00pm Eastern Time.</p><p>At 5:00pm Eastern Time the Bank of England's spokesperson stated that they had discovered a flaw in their previously held position and were withdrawing all 10gold bars from their vault, with each serial number being matched to a single registered bar.</p>
