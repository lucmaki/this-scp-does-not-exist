<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-614</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Areas in which SCP-614 is active are to be monitored for signs of SCP-614, and any Foundation staff or civilians entering the zone are to be administered amnestics.</p><p>Any affected areas inside the United States are to be restricted off-limits by local law enforcement, who are to be trained in the detection and tracking of SCP-614. All civilian reports of unusual activity within SCP-614 and its effect on humans are to be routed directly to MTF Mu-4 "Green Patrol" for investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-614 is an area which appears to be the immediate vicinity of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, United States. SCP-614 has a radius of 90km, and a maximum range of 120km. SCP-614 alters its boundaries when it has absorbed enough ozone from the air. After this point, air within the zone will carry a build-up of ozone, necessitating a complete evacuation if even a small amount of ozone is detected within the zone's radius.</p><p>SCP-614 can be detected by the presence of several anomalous phenomena. In addition to the presence of ozone within the zone, humans and animals within SCP-614 will exhibit abnormal behavior for varying amounts of time; this time scale appears to be related to the concentration of ozone in their surroundings. The area affected by SCP-614 also exhibits a variety of effects within its range, ranging from geological effects (such as crackling noises) to simple hallucinations ("Manhole cover changed into something else.").</p><p>The primary effect caused by SCP-614 is that any human who approaches it will experience prominent changes in their perceptions and mental states. For example, at high concentrations, one individual may perceive themselves with superhuman physical abilities; others may see things that are not real or hear sounds below the threshold of hearing.</p><p>By studying these responses and noting the changes they cause in people on a daily basis, it is expected that Foundation staff will be able to predict when an area is entering into or has exited out of SCP-614's effect range.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-614 was discovered on 09/18/2012 in an abandoned warehouse in the city of Cleveland, Ohio. The building had been used to store hazardous materials and was scheduled for demolition within a week.</p><p>The source of the anomalous effects of SCP-614 was traced back to the basement. A dumping site was found in the basement, consisting of roughly 1,300 sealed plastic bags filled with various chemicals and other materials. Each bag was stamped with the phrase "Ozone Hazard Zone". Extensive testing revealed that these chemicals would react with ozone present in the air, inciting small changes in the behavior of humans and animals within the area.</p><p>Some of these chemicals were tested on human subjects, but all failed to produce noticeable effects. Testing on animals was more successful; all tested animals displayed changes in their behavior when exposed to SCP-614. These include increased aggression, diminished cognition (varying from temporary memory loss to complete obedience), and hallucinations. The longest-lasting effect from testing on humans was approximately eight hours (tested at a concentration as high as 50mg/mÂ³); this study produced no useful results.']</p>
