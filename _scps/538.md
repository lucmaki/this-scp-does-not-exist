<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-538</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-538 is to be kept within a reinforced locker at Site-██. It is to be monitored for changes in composition, but amnestic treatment should be considered if any are observed. The contents of this locker are Class-A hazardous and must not be handled or viewed by unapproved personnel.</p><p>Due to its corrosive nature, SCP-538 is not permitted within ██████, the main site currently housing SCP-538. In the event that SCP-538 is brought into contact with any bodily fluid or tissue, personnel who have been exposed to it are to undergo immediate decontamination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-538 appears to be a collection of several different items, including two pairs of gloves and custom-made wrestling mats. The latter materials have been found to be highly resistant to causticity as well as being flame-retardant.</p><p>When worn, SCP-538's gloves grant the user the ability to produce amnestic compounds in a similar manner to adrenaline. These compounds induce varying effects depending on the user, but generally result in extreme pain or unconsciousness for those struck by it. As an additional effect, SCP-538 produces a corrosive substance when removed from its wearer's hands after contact. The substance is nonreactive and quickly dissolves cellular components in human tissue that makes direct contact with it; it also has an anomalous effect on biological media of various structures where it has been observed.</p><p>SCP-538 was first recovered from a raid conducted by Agents █████ and ████ in an abandoned warehouse along with one instance of SCP-███, one instance of SCP-███, and five currently unidentified individuals. All six individuals had been wearing instances of SCP-538 with varying degrees of success; the pair of handcloths had disintegrated creating large amounts of smoke while the other four instances produced little more than pain and discomfort in those affected (of which none were significantly incapacitated enough to require trauma surgery). In addition, all six individuals had been heavily drenched in corrosive fluid due to the malfunctioning gloves, and all had sustained severe burns on at least one limb despite attempts at self-preservation.</p><p>The corpses of these six individuals were found to have suffered extensive burns over nearly every part of their bodies before succumbing to massive internal hemorrhaging after losing contact with vascular systems; only their heads remained undamaged. The cause of death was determined to be cataclysmic disruption of vascular systems from loss of blood pressure leading to circulatory collapse.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-538 was initially found in the possession of a known De-classification Site-██ member. This individual had been using SCP-538 in an attempt to create a new type of amnestic that would induce severe pain and unconsciousness for those affected by it. The individual was able to produce a large quantity of corrosive fluid from their gloves, but only managed to wear them for three hours before the fluid leaked out of the gloves and destroyed the floor beneath them.</p><p>It is currently unknown how SCP-538's properties bypass its user's own chemistry."]</p>
