<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-913</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-913 is to be maintained in a standard containment locker at Sector-██, with the outer door kept open, and all access to said object made through opaque observation windows. The object itself is to be sealed within a Safe-class locker, locked with a standard keypad combination lock.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-913 is an approximately 1m tall, circa ████ BCE Greek marble sculpture. The object's signature has been carved into the object's base (See figure 1). SCP-913 depicts three nude figures in a stylized landscape setting of a forested area, with one figure carrying a banner, presumably depicting the figure's name. Besides this signature, the rest of the object remains largely undeciphered.</p><p>SCP-913 was originally recovered from a local collection of similar objects in [REDACTED], and immediately catalogued as an anomaly. All attempts to discern additional information on SCP-913 have failed and yielded no information, including attempts at translating it. The object is currently considered Safe and may be safely handled by personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-913 was originally cataloged as "Unknown Object". However, further investigation into the object\'s anomalous properties revealed that it was, in fact, able to make the following statement.']</p>
