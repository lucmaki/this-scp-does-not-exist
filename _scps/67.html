<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-67</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the nature of SCP-67, containment has been deemed impossible.</p><p>For the time being, SCP-67 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-64. Any personnel who come into contact with SCP-67 are to be terminated immediately by authorized personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-67 is a crow. SCP-67 demonstrates the ability to pick up inanimate objects, and will do so at random. This ability has not yet been replicated.</p><p>While SCP-67 is capable of picking up things, it has shown no skill in doing so. When asked, SCP-67 is unable to describe what it is doing when picking something up. SCP-67 seems completely unaware of its anomalous behavior.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
