<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-571</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-571 is to be held in a standard Safe-class locker. It is to be kept in a temperature-controlled room, with its lid left open at all times. Should any damage be done to SCP-571, it is to be repaired immediately by MTF Λ-5 ("Hackers").</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-571 is a small metal cup, measuring 7.5 mm across its top edge, with a diameter of 12 mm. It weighs 1.3 kilograms and is hollow on the inside, although this is not apparent when it is in use.</p><p>If a living organism drinks from SCP-571, then proceeds to drink alcohol for a period of at least one hour, the drinker will experience increased levels of serotonin in the brain. This effect manifests as an anomalous connection between the brain and the stomach, resulting in prolonged undigested portions of alcohol being voided from the body via the esophagus. The effects of this chemical imbalance are visible as they occur; while drinking alcohol, the subject's pupils will dilate slightly and their lips will moisten noticeably.</p>
