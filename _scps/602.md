<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-602</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Information regarding the existence of SCP-602 is to be suppressed by any and all means necessary, including but not limited to disinformation campaigns, propaganda, censorship, and misinformation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-602 is a piece of software written by ███████ ██████, commonly known as "the Unibomber". It is an interactive virtual reality environment that allows users to explore the mind of ███████ ██████.</p><p>SCP-602 exists in a semi-hypnotic state when it is not being used by personnel. While in this state, SCP-602's functions can be accessed through the use of a keyboard and monitor. The user will find themselves in a room containing multiple chairs and a table. On the table are several objects bearing the designation "SCP-602". These objects act as markers for locations within SCP-602's simulated environment. The order in which these markers are placed on the table varies from user to user, but in all cases they always form a geometric pattern.</p><p>Once the marker has been placed on the table, the user may activate SCP-602 through completing a series of tasks that allow them to communicate with ███████ ██████. This communication is nonverbal and takes place through thought impulses that are projected into the brain of the user.</p><p>The exact tasks required to gain access to SCP-602 vary depending on the user, but typically involve an attempt to obtain knowledge through conversations with ███████ ██████. The end result usually consists of either frustrating or confusing information being communicated by SCP-602.</p>
