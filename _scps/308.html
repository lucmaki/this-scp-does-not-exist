<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-308</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-308 is kept at Site-75. All logs, data, and research pertaining to SCP-308 are to be kept in sealed storage containers until further notice. Personnel are to be highly cautious when interacting with SCP-308 and must document any anomalous phenomena before communicating with it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-308 is a large, humanoid entity which has been observed to take the shape of an upright, human male in the years since its disappearance. SCP-308 possesses hands similar to those of a normal human but are full of black cracks, and are exposed to the outside via gaps in its arms. SCP-308's face has several cracks around its mouth and eyes as well as its nose and ears, with one ear dangling from each side of its head. SCP-308's lower jaw is missing, leaving it able to speak only with its tongue.</p><p>SCP-308 speaks in the same way that humans do, despite having no vocal cords or larynx. Although usually amicable towards Foundation personnel when first discovered and given the proper paperwork needed to gain entrance into Site-75, SCP-308 expresses disinterest in reading through documents or watching videos given by Foundation personnel. It consistently asks that items be signed out at times where it is not present to receive them.</p><p>When questioned about how it comes into possession of items, SCP-308 claims that it receives items via "people". When asked how this can be possible given its presence in Site-75's containment chamber, SCP-308 states that it is able to access these items "through the walls" whenever it feels like it. Furthermore, SCP-308 claims that "[it] would rather not speak about [these people]". However, when prompted for more information on this topic by researchers, SCP-308 states that these people have withheld information from it on purpose and that they must "get back to [it] soon".</p><p>SCP-308 will consistently ask if any objects brought into Site-75 have been signed out and return them after being assured that they have not been taken home. If any of these objects are removed from Site-75 before being returned by SCP-308, the object will disappear hours after being removed whilst the Foundation is at work. Both anomaly(s) and object(s) will reappear in an identical condition upon their return. If a team is scheduled to perform maintenance on area checked by SCP-308 during its routine checkups, they should inform their supervisor as they will not be permitted to continue working in this area until further notice.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-308 is currently unresponsive to standard means of communication; researchers are currently attempting to find a way to communicate with it without revealing its nature. No contact has been made with it since 2/22/20██, when it went missing for several hours before returning. It is unknown how SCP-308 disappeared during this time.</p>
