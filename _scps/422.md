<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-422</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A single Foundation Task Force (TF) is to be stationed at the site of SCP-422. All team members are expected to be proficient with firearms, explosives, and first aid. Guards are to provide security for SCP-422 and prevent unauthorized access.</p><p>Any person entering within a range of 70m from SCP-422 is to be considered as having been affected by SCP-422. These affected persons must then proceed directly to their nearest Foundation medical center, or be administered an injection of epinephrine at the first opportunity. Any personnel coming into contact with SCP-422 are to be immediately removed from its vicinity, as are all stray animals drawn to it (see Incident Log 422).</p><p>The remaining components of SCP-422 may be used for experimental purposes by researchers assigned to SCP-422 and authorized by the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-422 is a facility located in ██████, Japan. It consists of a large warehouse containing dozens of rooms, many of which contain foodstuffs, most of which appear to be edible. The warehouse appears to have been converted for SCP use, as it contains numerous hooks and shelves on the walls, presumably for clothing or other items.</p><p>Said persons affected by SCP-422 will move towards any food source within a range of 70m from SCP-422. Said food will be eaten by said individuals randomly, usually a maximum of two servings, at random intervals. Affected persons are not able to recognize whether the food is edible or not (see Incident Log 422). Attempts to determine its nutritional content have thus far failed.</p><p>SCP-422 has also been known to affect cats, apparently due to its association with former research projects involving genetically altered cats. Said cats are found in SCP-422's vicinity nearly exclusively at night and are typically confused and disoriented when discovered. Two deceased cats were recovered from the vicinity after being observed by an individual affected by SCP-422.</p><p>No person affected by SCP-422 has reported feeling ill after eating the food found within its proximity. Persons affected by SCP-422 will attempt to provide their own sustenance to themselves if absent from said location for more than one week.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Incident Log 422</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/██</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> SCP-422</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The following is an account of an incident involving SCP-422's effect on a non-anomalous individual.</p><p>Personnel assigned to SCP-422 were investigating a large trash pile located in the warehouse's vicinity. Upon entering, several items were observed within the pile that were clearly edible. After several minutes of confusion and disorientation, one of the affected individuals began to move towards the food. Approximately 15 minutes later, he was found unconscious at the site of SCP-422. The individual was revived and taken to a medical center.</p><p>Following further investigation, it was determined that the individual had been affected by SCP-422 after entering the area of the trash pile. Both effects of SCP-422 and its unique ability to affect humans have been determined to have been caused by a combination of the chemical makeup of the food recovered from the trash pile, and a previously unknown compound in said food."]</p>
