<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-229</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-229 instances are to be contained in reinforced high-security cryogenic containers, located within a Type 1 Safe at Site-25's Cryogenics Wing. When such an instance is removed from its containment space, it is to be attached by several straps and cables to a large ring and suspended over the main chamber of the Type 1 Safe.</p><p>The interior surface of the Type 1 safe is lined with a reflective coating for protection against accidental exposure to SCP-229. When not in use, the Safe's interior should be left empty to reduce the likelihood of an accidental breach.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-229 is a collection of several hundred skeletal remains recovered from a small structure located in Solomon Islands. The corpses have yet to be properly identified. The bones lack any known pathological characteristics, but do appear to be more akin to those recovered from an ancient burial site on Mars than anything living on Earth.</p><p>When SCP-229's temperature has fallen below approximately -133 °C (zero kelvins), it will begin to expel large quantities of frozen carbon dioxide gas from various orifices and pores within its structure. At this temperature, these gas emissions will not travel more than 200 meters from where they were released.</p><p>The amount of carbon dioxide produced by an SCP-229 instance is directly proportional to the temperature of its interior space; when heated to a temperature above -40 °C (-40 °F) it will also produce significant volumes of highly fluorine containing compounds and compounds containing silicon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 229-1:</strong> Shortly after discovery of SCP-229, the body of a young Caucasian adult male was found in a nearby cave. The body was missing its lower extremities and had been buried with the deceased's arms in a fetal position. Autopsy results indicated that the subject had been born without limbs.</p><p>The body also possessed a significant heart failure, due to a severe arrhythmia which was found to be localized to the heart. The autopsy also revealed that the subject lacked any known blood type or genetic markers and had only been diagnosed with a mild form of thalassemia. It is unknown how the subject died, but it is believed he may have been a victim of cannibalism."]</p>
