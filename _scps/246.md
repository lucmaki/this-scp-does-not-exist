<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-246</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-246 is to be kept in an irremovable steel enclosure, positioned on a flat roof. The roof is to be kept clear of snow and ice at all times. SCP-246 may not be moved from its current location, or removed from its case, under any circumstance due to the possibility that the structure could collapse and cause damage to the containment chamber in addition to causing damage to SCP-246 itself.</p><p>In order to prevent incident 246-X, during operation of SCP-246 it is not permitted for personnel to use any hang gliders in order to avoid having another instance of incident 246-X occur. If a situation arises in which another instance of this event is unavoidable, a member of Level 3 Clearance must be present at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-246 is a hang glider. Its "unusual properties" are dependent on the location, such as the time of day, and the weather conditions. If a sufficient amount of snow is present in the area it will generate a large wall of snow at a rate of 4 ft/s away from it. The snow is pure white in color and ten times denser than normal snow. If there are no snow particles present, the walls will appear solid, but will be able to be see through if one were to look at it from an angle. This wall is capable of protecting SCP-246 from any hostile attacks, however it will not protect it from being affected by wind or rain.</p><p>If sufficient clouds cover the sky and if it is night time then SCP-246 will attempt to leave its container. SCP-246 will detect nearby hang gliders and attempt to attach itself to them. It will usually do this by creating a pair of pontoons; by extruding additional hanging points inside its cases. Once attached, SCP-246 will fly with its attached hang glider at high speeds until a sufficient amount of speed is reached that they "break free" (see incident 246-X).</p><p>SCP-246 was originally discovered during a routine inspection of an abandoned warehouse located in ████████, ██. When personnel entered the building they found SCP-246 attached to one of their hang glider's wingtips and began to fly around "chasing each other" (see incident 246-X). After flying for approximately two hours, which caused several vehicle crashes due to traffic accidents occurring along the way, all instances of SCP-246 flew away from each other and slowly descended back towards their original location. All instances were recovered via various██████ vehicles when they landed back at the warehouse's location.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 246-A:</strong> Incident 246-X:</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</p><p>SCP-246 flew around a closed off area of the warehouse where all hang gliders were stored. A large wall of snow was present at the time, but no snow particles were present. After approximately 15 minutes of flying this wall fell apart as if it was made out of fog or ice. Approximately 40 minutes after occurrence of incident 246-X, a large explosion occurred in the same warehouse and the ceiling collapsed inside the building, causing it to become a complete ruin. The only surviving entity from the warehouse was SCP-246, because when it left to chase another hang glider (see incident 246-X) it detached itself from the rest of its "pack" and approached an open door on the other side of the building. SCP-246 then flew outside into the open air and back towards its containment chamber. During this time, a large amount of snowfall occurred with many vehicles becoming disabled by the snowfall.</p><p>After returning to its containment chamber SCP-246 immediately initiated its "unusual properties" (See Description). All personnel present were saved by the wall of snow quickly forming in front of them prior to their bodies being crushed under the weight of it. A large amount of snow fell onto SCP-246 and caused minor damage to it, but did not cause any structural failure or damage to itself.']</p>
