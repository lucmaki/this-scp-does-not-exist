<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-718</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-718 is located in an inaccessible vault at Site-77. The installation of 518 "Barber Pole" barriers around the perimeter of the perimeter of SCP-718 are to be rotated every 14 days to ensure that no individuals attempt to enter SCP-718 without authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-718 is a rectangular structure built of reinforced concrete, measuring approximately 1.6m in width and 2.4m in height. The walls are painted a light brown color with no discernible patterns. The floor of SCP-718 consists of a series of large drain holes that extend from the center towards the outer perimeter of SCP-718 (see installation log).</p><p>Any individual who enters SCP-718 without authorization will experience sensory feedback from within the structure. The sensation is described as a "vibrating hum" through the head and neck. At this point, the subject will be unable to close their eyes or open their mouth. Subsequent attempts to exit SCP-718 will result in the subject's collapse on the ground, comatose until death. No subjects have ever survived herding large numbers of these individuals inside SCP-718 (see containment log).</p><p>The air within SCP-718 is not breathable, despite not being obviously toxic or hazardous. There are no detectable sources of oxygen within SCP-718, and subjects have found themselves unable to breathe due to lack of oxygen consumption by vital organs starting about 15 minutes after entering SCP-718. Once all vital signs cease, subjects will expire where they lie until removal from SCP-718.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Installation Log</p><p><strong>08/07/████:</strong> In order to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering SCP-718 without authorization, 518 weather-resistant barriers are installed around the perimeter of SCP-718.</p><p><strong>08/21/████:</strong> After approximately six weeks, one of the barriers has been breached. The interior portion of the barrier is found to be missing. DCs Thorne, Whiteley, and Brown examine the interior portion of the barrier, which they find to be an intricate mosaic of a human face. Contact is made with Foundation Archeologists and Human Resources department. The face is given the designation of SCP-718-1.</p><p>Upon examination, SCP-718-1 is found to be an anomalous object. SCP-718-1 is a human face constructed entirely out of finely carved quartz sandstone, measuring 1.9 meters in height. It has a frame constructed entirely of bronze and gilded brass to support its weight. The eyes are made from glass and are blue with a yellow iris; the eyes are identical to those of SCP-718-2. SCP-718-1 wears no clothing, with only a few strands of hair protruding from the top of its head.</p><p>SCP-718-1 was originally discovered on December 24th, 1995 by a Foundation surveillance team in ████████, Ohio (the home town of SCP-718). At this time, all members of the surveillance team were infected by SCP-718 and were unable to report back to their superiors, including the lead researcher Dr. Lyman.</p><p>After several months of searching, Foundation personnel located Dr. Lyman in his home in ██████ ██████ and extracted him from the residence before any further harm could be done to him or his family. Dr. Lyman was detained and given medical attention before being returned to Foundation custody.']</p>
