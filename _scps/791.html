<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-791</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-791 is stored in a standard containment unit at Site-77, which is to be kept underground. SCP-791 is to be kept away from any air sources and subjected to an air purity of no less than 99.99% at all times. No personnel are to be permitted within SCP-791's chamber unless accompanied by two Level 3 personnel armed with fully automatic firearms. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to enter SCP-791's chamber will be denied access, or forcibly removed.</p><p>Any personnel showing symptoms of SCP-791 exposure are to immediately be transported for medical care; any personnel who dies as a result of SCP-791 exposure are to be reported as fatalities due to inhaling smoke. Any air samples taken from within the containment chamber of SCP-791 are to be preserved within sealed brown pouches and checked every hour; samples outside of this time frame are to be discarded. Personnel with confirmed exposure are not permitted outside of the containment chamber.</p><p>All personnel who have been exposed to SCP-791 during testing are considered contaminated and must undergo decontamination procedures at their own expense.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-791 is a 1942 freight train in fixed, non-operational condition. The car bodies of SCP-791 appear to be heavily corroded, and in some cases completely destroyed. An anomalous effect has been identified in all car bodies; the doors of all cars are opened automatically by unknown means (alarms do not seem to activate), and each compartment within shows a different scene from an unknown time period.</p><p>SCP-791's locomotive is capable of operation via manual control; however, it does not make any sounds or lights are present. When questioned, the driver states that he was instructed not to proceed with SCP-791's original plan of transportation. SCP-791's crew also claims that the locomotive's driver suffered from severe blood loss shortly before driving SCP-791 into Site-77.</p>
