<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-237</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-237 is no longer active and does not require containment. SCP-237 is to remain at the current location and is not to be moved by any means. Due to the nature of the object, access to SCP-237 is currently restricted to Level 4 clearance or higher personnel. A Foundation bunker is being constructed near the location at which SCP-237 was located, and will be used solely for the purpose of containing it in the event that it is reactivated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-237 is a humanoid entity, being approximately 1.9 meters tall with a mass of 58 kilograms. SCP-237 appears to be constructed of metal and plastic parts. The face, humanlike but with an unearthly appearance, bears no resemblance to that of any person known to the Foundation. As SCP-237 moves, its clothing shifts so as to maintain its humanoid appearance. SCP-237's body is covered with a series of circular symbols arranged in an apparently decorative pattern.</p><p>SCP-237 has exhibited three anomalous properties: motionless state; apparent sentience; and self-repairing qualities. When these traits are activated, the full extent of their effect will be explained below.</p><p>The motionless state is limited in that it does not affect SCP-237's physical form itself - it will still appear to be alive and moving - but its surrounding environment will behave exactly as it would if the object were not there at all. This effect can last for several hours before activating again, during which time anyone within the area will report that they are unable to move their limbs or muscles while inside the affected area. This effect will cease upon SCP-237 leaving its motionless state. No one outside the affected area has ever lived through an SCP-237 anomaly event and reported seeing anything unusual during this time period except for SCP-237 itself, who remains completely motionless during this period.</p><p>As for apparent sentience, individuals (defined as people who have access to SCPs through means other than direct contact) who are part of or witness events within or near SCP-237's field of effect may find that they suddenly come under increased scrutiny by authorities or community members. This effect will continue until either being evicted from the affected area or escaping from its anomalous field of effect on their own before expiring naturally at some point after 48 hours following initial exposure to SCP-237's anomalous qualities while in the affected area. If a member of the public is provided with adequate documentation explaining possible Foundation involvement with an event, they will be less likely to judge those involved with or witnessing them as mentally unstable for believing in such a scenario, even if no evidence suggests otherwise.</p><p>These properties also apply to groups involved with containment of instances of SCP-237 rather than just free members of the public being exposed to it directly; although this has yet to be tested on Foundation personnel.</p><p>Activation: To activate SCP-237's anomalous qualities, one subject must allude another individual within sight by making eye contact and mentally speaking "Welcome to Disneyland". The first instance which activates is considered SCP-237(1)-A and is responsible for the anomalies described above. Instances following immediately behind (2)-A and -B) may then activate when triggered by another instance (3)-C). Instances will always follow this sequence chronologically, unless they are separated across multiple trips without fail by travelling at least 500 kilometers away from each other or being held at Area ██████████ prior to testing, both of which expire after 60 days without exchange between instances or removal from Area ██████████ by security personnel (see Testing Logs). SCP-237 will display intelligence and memory retention comparable to persons 21 years old at most when activated and usually retains previous information regarding objects it was previously connected with; this effect is only present while they retain awareness which has been directly linked with another instance of SCP-237 itself in addition to other instances over a period longer than five minutes since disconnection from it (see Test Logs for details). To avoid activation through such means, instances should remain nearby each other whenever not actively in use; however, this can decrease efficiency due to needing more personnel required for transport when compared to alternatives such as retrieval via autonomous robots (see Testing Logs).</p><p>Test Results:</p><p>Note: Only results relevant in regards to previous knowledge have been included below.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-237 was originally contained at Disneyland in Anaheim, California until it was contained by the Foundation following a containment breach on ██/██/20██. At that time, SCP-237 was deactivated by the Foundation and contained in a bunker constructed in the area where it was found. On ██/██/████, the construction of the bunker caused a containment breach which resulted in the death of seven security personnel and the escape of 17 contained instances of SCP-237; as such, testing has been suspended indefinitely. The current location of SCP-237 is currently unknown to the Foundation.']</p>
