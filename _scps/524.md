<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-524</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-524 is to be kept in a locked container in G wing at Site-19. A radio receiver is to be checked on a biweekly basis for any abnormal broadcasts.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-524 is a manila envelope containing a handwritten letter, and a photograph of its owner. A handwritten note on the reverse side reads "To my beloved James".</p><p>All attempts to link SCP-524 to an individual have failed, as no trace of the sender has been found.</p><p>The photograph depicts a human male with short blond hair, wearing a business suit and Navy officer's cap. The subject's face is partially obscured by an open umbrella.</p><p>When opened, SCP-524 causes a radio station playing music to become audible on all receivers within a 0.5 meter radius. Analysis of recordings indicate that the music is mostly jazz and swing popular in 1945, with occasional songs recorded in the 1970s. The musical style most resembles the genre Calypso Jazz; however, the content of some songs is decidedly more risqué than typical pieces produced during this period. For example, the recording features several instances of gratuitous profanity and descriptions of sexual intercourse (described above) from "the love machine", accompanied by taped sounds of an orgasm.</p><p>The only known method of neutralizing SCP-524’s anomalous effects is for subjects to listen to it for one hour without interruption; otherwise, subjects may begin hallucinating on an as-needed basis after 20 minutes. Those who experience hallucinations are to be administered Class B amnestics, followed by medical observation and psychotherapy if necessary under Dr. █████'s supervision at Site-19. Such subjects are to be told that they were not listening to SCP-524; D-class personnel are guaranteed immunity from this effect due to extended confinement.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong></p><p>The following is the transcript of SCP-524's effects in ██/██/19██. Dr. █████ was to administer the Class B amnestics; however, he died of a heart attack during the procedure. He was replaced by Dr. ████, who has not reported any unusual effects in over █ months. There are currently no recorded instances of SCP-524's anomalous properties taking effect."]</p>
