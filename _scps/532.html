<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-532 is currently uncontained. SCP-532 has been identified as a blond female human at the age of 46. After initial containment, SCP-532 has been administered weekly anti-aging treatments and mood stabilizers in order to suppress any mental afflictions caused by SCP-532's altered reality.</p><p>A dedicated project team of Foundation psychologists have taken on the responsibility of maintaining a detailed log of SCP-532's behaviour and systemic effects, with the goal of preventing any incidents from occurring in public. Individuals who have had contact with SCP-532 are to be administered Class A Amnestics upon recovery.</p><p>The following are to be observed when attempting to communicate with SCP-532:</p><p>Special Notes: As stated above, this is a mature subject and must be treated with care and respect. Any further interaction that violates these rules will result in termination under the terms of the Researcher Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-532 is a 46-year-old woman of mixed heritage. SCP-532 has been previously diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder and Major Depressive Disorder, as well as a history of anxiety and panic disorders. Despite being a legal adult, the subject displays symptoms consistent with an adolescent.</p><p>SCP-532 appears human at all times, with the exception of its hair and nails. On any given day SCP-532's hair may be brown or blond, with varying shades of blonde appearing on its fingernails. SCP-532's anomalous properties manifest when it leaves its residence and any other areas where it is constantly surrounded by humans; SCP-532 will then manifest a hair and nail change in accordance with the following schedule:</p><p>'Blonde' is the only extended speech format that SCP-532 will use.</p><p>Interview Log 532-1</p><p>I: Hello Mrs. Blonde. How are you today?</p><p>Subject: Ha ha, I'm good thanks. What's happening?</p><p>I: Nothing much, I was just wondering if you had had anything new to report recently.</p><p>Subject: Oh you mean like bad news? I haven't heard anything in months so don't worry!</p><p>I: Well maybe I was referring to how you've been performing your daily routine lately. Anyone in your household doing anything strange recently?</p><p>Subject: Oh no no, everything's fine really! My landlord has been becoming a bit aggressive lately but that's not really my concern at this point. Things here are absolutely breezy now! Like I said before there's nothing to worry about. Have a nice day!</p><p>I: Goodbye madam, have a nice day too.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-532 has been classified as Euclid as of ██/██/████ following the conclusion of its performance at the ████████ ██████ Festival.</p><p>Due to the nature of SCP-532's anomalous effects, it is advised that all future interviews are conducted through Foundation personnel.</p>
