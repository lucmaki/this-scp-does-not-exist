<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-219</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-219 is to be contained in a high-security storage unit. A standard cover story regarding the nature of the object and its facility is to be disseminated among the population at large. Following successful isolation, all personnel are to be issued with an article of clothing or item of apparel bearing the Foundation logo which must remain on their person at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-219 consists of a circular piece of fabric measuring approximately 300m in diameter, suspended at a height of 1.5m from the ceiling of SCP-219's containment unit. The item is comprised of a highly durable weave which does not fray under mundane conditions and shows no signs of deterioration over time. It is only accessible by physically entering the containment unit and ducking below an inconspicuous archway along the floor.</p><p>This artifact appears to be the result of an anomalous duplication process: the area of cloth in direct view (in this case, the entire piece) is identical and appears unaltered to all viewers, while the remainder (an internal portion referred to as SCP-219-1) remains invisible to all without aid. However, it may be viewed through means other than direct observation. For example, if one were to place a mobile phone or similarly portable device on top of SCP-219-1 or inside it, or within 100 meters or angles maintained by it, it would then appear to have been modified by its owner; for example, appearing blank or altered based on what was displayed on said device.</p><p>SCP-219 has been isolated and contained at [REDACTED] following reports from local civilian populations regarding their discovery in the area surrounding settlements where individuals who had displayed knowledge regarding anomalous objects had resided in previous years. The property where SCP-219 was discovered had recently been purchased by [REDACTED]. While initial explorations pointed towards possible association between SCP-219 and said property's former occupant, neither could prove its relevance as a result of ongoing communications issues between Foundation personnel and local authorities.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
