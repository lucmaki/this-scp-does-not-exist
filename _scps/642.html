<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-642</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The exterior of SCP-642 is to be covered with a fiberglass and wood-reinforced pressure-treated exterior wall, while the interior is to be fenced with security fence at least 4  meters deep and reinforced with polyurethane foam. Any trespasser attempting to enter SCP-642 must be intercepted by security personnel prior to entry. Entry from air, land, or water requires Level 4 clearance or above.</p><p>SCP-642 poses no threat to Foundation personnel, but any unauthorized persons entering SCP-642 is to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-642 is a cubical structure of unknown origin, roughly 20  meters on each side. The structure is braced with several large timbers in three places and covered by a tarpaulin. It contains several human skeletons, each in a different stage of decay and shape.</p><p>The interior of SCP-642 has been designated as chamber A, while the rest of the structure as chamber B. Chamber B appears to be where the majority of the mass of the interior structure would be located. It consists primarily of a wooden table and chairs, directly underneath which are dozens of round black holes approximately 0.5  centimeters across. These holes are about half an inch wide and range to the ceiling. Each hole is surrounded by decaying paper or rags. All paper around these holes have flowed into them, with no identifiable source for this material, leaving only piles of dust in their wake. Likewise, there is no identifiable means for actually entering or exiting B other than through the small holes in the wall or ceiling; any attempt to do so does not result in the door opening and will result in it becoming completely sealed shut after several minutes.</p><p>Although this area has been continuously guarded since discovery, no evidence has been found that supports why it was built or how it was transported here; it appears to have gone remarkably unaffected by time itself.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
