<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-85</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-85 is to be stored at Bio-Research Area-83, located in the heart of ████████. Access to this area is restricted to Level 3/85 personnel. Testing on SCP-85 is only to be performed by Level 4/85 personnel, and as such all testing is conducted by a single member of research staff. Any additional notes on test procedures are to be recorded in the test log and included in this file.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-85 is an empty 5 mL vial of ethanol with a glass stopper attached to its cap. The writing on the label reads “Prod. 05”, and matches the style of other labels found on other objects in the same location. SCP-85 displays no anomalous effects when intact, but upon damage becomes volatile and releases an unknown chemical substance into the air. This substance produces a strong plasticizer effect, which causes all solid matter that comes into contact with it to be used as plastic. If this plastic is then melted by fire or any other heat source, it will coalesce into SCP-85 once again.</p><p>The ultimate purpose of SCP-85 is unclear, although its discovery appears to have been pivotal to the containment efforts of the Site ██ incident, as detailed in Document 85-01.</p><p>Below is a log of tests performed on SCP-85.</p><p>Test Log 85-01</p><p>Test: Hardening of Resin</p><p>Result: On placing a piece of a candle in SCP-85 and applying 30V DC to its base, the candle fractured and took on a semi-plastic texture similar to SCP-182.</p><p>Notes: This test seems to indicate that when fire melts resin it merely hardens it instead of releasing plastic like the resin did before the fire was applied. Research on what happens when resin is heated via electricity has been reopened.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 85-01:</strong> Document 85-01</p><p>Complicated event occurred at Site ██ in ████████, ██ on ██/██/19██. As of this moment, it is unknown whether the events that took place were a result of SCP-85 or purely an accident; however, the following is what is known.</p><p>During the events of which Document 85-01 speaks, a fire started in the Site ██ Testing Wing. This fire was put out by the onsite fire brigade, and no casualties were reported. The fire caused damage to the wing, which destroyed all testing equipment within its confines. It is unclear whether or not the fire was caused by SCP-85, but it seems likely given its effect on some plastic materials.</p><p>Upon investigation, it soon became apparent that someone had removed SCP-85 from its containment area. It has since been discovered that the majority of the equipment which was destroyed was used to test Resin - a substance that allowed for the creation of a durable resin-like material through heat. When SCP-85 was put into contact with Resin, it would harden and become indestructible like real resin would be, but this process was impossible during testing due to the nature of Resin. However, as Resin could be easily melted by fire, it was used in test after test until they developed an easy method of doing so.</p><p>Although the substance that SCP-85 produces is highly volatile, it appears to degrade slowly over time and will eventually degrade completely if not used. It is unknown how long Resin itself has been in testing, but based on the fact that it was used to test Resin and not something similar to it leads me to believe that Resin has been in testing for a while now.']</p>
