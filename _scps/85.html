<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-85</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-85 is to be stored at Bio-Research Area-83, located in the heart of ████████. Access to this area is restricted to Level 3/85 personnel. Testing on SCP-85 is only to be performed by Level 4/85 personnel, and as such all testing is conducted by a single member of research staff. Any additional notes on test procedures are to be recorded in the test log and included in this file.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-85 is an empty 5 mL vial of ethanol with a glass stopper attached to its cap. The writing on the label reads “Prod. 05”, and matches the style of other labels found on other objects in the same location. SCP-85 displays no anomalous effects when intact, but upon damage becomes volatile and releases an unknown chemical substance into the air. This substance produces a strong plasticizer effect, which causes all solid matter that comes into contact with it to be used as plastic. If this plastic is then melted by fire or any other heat source, it will coalesce into SCP-85 once again.</p><p>The ultimate purpose of SCP-85 is unclear, although its discovery appears to have been pivotal to the containment efforts of the Site ██ incident, as detailed in Document 85-01.</p><p>Below is a log of tests performed on SCP-85.</p><p>Test Log 85-01</p><p>Test: Hardening of Resin</p><p>Result: On placing a piece of a candle in SCP-85 and applying 30V DC to its base, the candle fractured and took on a semi-plastic texture similar to SCP-182.</p><p>Notes: This test seems to indicate that when fire melts resin it merely hardens it instead of releasing plastic like the resin did before the fire was applied. Research on what happens when resin is heated via electricity has been reopened.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
