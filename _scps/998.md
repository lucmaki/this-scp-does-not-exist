<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-998</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-998 is to be surrounded by a 6-meter wide buffer zone, which is to be patrolled by Foundation agents at all times. No civilians are permitted within the buffer zone. If any civilians enter SCP-998 and are within 50m of the SCP-998 perimeter, they are to be terminated on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-998 is an area of about 3km in diameter, located in [REDACTED] on the western coast of the Yudaya Peninsula. SCP-998 is surrounded by a gray metal fence with no visible entrance. The fence surrounds SCP-998 and is connected to the shoreline.</p><p>SCP-998 resembles a small village, with several wooden buildings and a generator providing power. Wooden steps lead from the beach down to the beach at the foot of the mountain on which SCP-998 is situated. On top of the mountain there are several wooden buildings, some of which have been destroyed or are in disrepair.</p><p>At irregular intervals, SCP-998 will spontaneously generate what appears to be a small child between 2 and 12 years old. The child will wander around SCP-998 aimlessly before disappearing again. If any human being approaches SCP-998 and is within 50m of the SCP-998 perimeter, they will disappear without a trace and reappear within 100m of their original location when SCP-998 generates another child.</p><p>SCP-998 generates approximately 1 new child every 20 minutes. During this time, no children appear outside of SCP-998 and no children appear within 50m of the barrier surrounding SCP-998. Children generated within SCP-998 have displayed several anomalous properties:</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 998-F:</strong> SCP-998 is currently under special containment. There is no known way to prevent SCP-998 from generating children, and SCP-998's security protocol has been upgraded to prevent civilian and Foundation researchers from entering the area. A monitoring station has been installed near the site, and it will be monitored for any manifestations of SCP-998."]</p>
