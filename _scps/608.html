<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-608</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-608 is to be stored in a Standard Containment Locker at Site-17. Access to SCP-608 requires authorisation from at least one (1) Level 3 or higher personnel with access to SCP-608. No objects or individuals currently have access authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-608 is a green leather belt measuring approximately 17cm in width, with a black leather tabbing area measuring approximately 7cm in length. The composition of SCP-608 does not have any organic or synthetic components. When worn by an individual, SCP-608 displays properties identical to those of an ordinary pair of pants. However, supplemental information obtained from the subject wearing SCP-608 reveals that the subject's body will appear as if wearing nothing at all, regardless of the subject's typical appearance when dressed.</p><p>SCP-608 can be found in conjunction with the following aural phenomena:</p><p>Interviewed subjects report hearing a booming sound resembling faraway thunder when wearing SCP-608 and claiming to feel the vibrations from their entire body.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
