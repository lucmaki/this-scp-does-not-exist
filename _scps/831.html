<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-831</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All tanks housing SCP-831 instances are to be fitted with internal air filtration systems. No materials which fall under red or yellow toxic categories are to be allowed in any of the tanks housing SCP-831 instances.</p><p>Before each experiment, all staff are to undergo screening for viral and bacterial infection. Staff that test positive will unfortunately be forced to leave the building until their condition improves.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-831 is an organism consisting of a single cell type, human erythromyces-bunyardii. SCP-831 instances are genetically identical to normal cells that would be found in a human body.</p><p>CLASP-831 (Complete Life Analysis Support Platform 831) is a Mac computer, built specifically for SCP-831 research. SCP-831 is capable of analyzing any and all data produced by the computer, acting as a storage device and processor all in one. As part of these precautions, the computer must have no less than 3 hours of uninterrupted power supply, and must be kept indoors at all times.</p><p>SCP-831 has the ability to generate another instance of itself, although whether or not this will occur under normal circumstances is unknown. An SCP-831 instance can be grown from any cell with an extremely high number of chromosomes, usually reaching levels of 200 or more. The process is inefficient however due to the low efficiency at which new organisms grow and the large size of the initial cells being used as templates.</p><p>SCP-831 can survive in any environment that would support standard laboratory lifeforms (including non hazardous ones), but does not require food or oxygen to sustain itself. It also does not cause any changes in cells it comes into contact with, although this could be a result of its being a single cell organism rather than being naturally resistant to such effects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> All SCP-831 instances currently in Foundation custody were originally discovered by BSL-4 personnel in a sanitarium in ████, ██████. After investigation, it was found that the sanitarium had been sending the erythromyces-bunyardii organisms to other facilities for experimentation on human subjects.</p><p>SCP-831 was then contained by BSL-4 personnel and an attempt to terminate the organism was made. It was discovered however that these effects did not occur outside of a single living cell, and attempts to kill the organism by lighting it with explosives failed, with the exception of one instance which was destroyed along with its container.</p><p>The organism has proven impossible to terminate in any other way than the initial explosion, and has since been contained. After containment, it is still possible to induce cellular suicide in the organism, but this has not yet been observed.</p>
