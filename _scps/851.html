<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-851</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-851 is located in a standard high-security storage area containing lighter flammable liquids. The exterior of SCP-851's container has been painted with a substance that prevents it from igniting on its own or when applied heat or pressure is applied to the surface. Any personnel suspected of having caused any damage to SCP-851's container are to be administered amnestics, with all personnel involved in the incident being temporarily withheld for questioning.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-851 is a white, plastic bucket with a black spray paint logo on the side. A small hole in the bottom of SCP-851 leads to a secondary chamber containing a second instance of SCP-851 (designated SCP-851-2) and its contents.</p><p>When something is placed into SCP-851 and the valve is turned on, it creates incendiary foam that liquefies on contact with air. This foam takes 75 seconds to evaporate completely, leaving a residue that contains traces of any liquids that were present in said objects when they were loaded into SCP-851. The residues have been compared with human blood, resulting in some of the most accurate descriptions of their actual appearance.</p><p>After having been emptied of all liquid, both instances of SCP-851 will begin creating an effect that they would be very effective at performing if the effect was not already common knowledge among members of Foundation personnel. Attempting to use either instance as originally intended will result in spontaneous combustion within two seconds; attempting to use one instance without the other results in detonation after two seconds.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
