<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-542</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-542 is to be kept in a custom containment locker at Site-74, a facility located in Northern California with access to low humidity and minimal light conditions. The safety of Site-74 personnel is to be maintained at all times, and termination of life threatening situations is to be handled by onsite security personnel. Any personnel leaving SCP-542's containment should come equipped with waterproof shoes, car guards, and life jackets.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-542 is an analog wristwatch with a digital display identical to the ██████ model, produced in 2000. The object is handmade and coated with a mineral oil that makes it waterproof, but not chemically resistant. Water contacting the object will make the digits on the digital display go blank until evaporated away by heat generated by human interaction.</p><p>SCP-542's anomalous effects are activated when the user engages in a state of conscious rest known as sleep paralysis. Upon activating SCP-542, a person will appear to be floating above their bed, where they will watch themselves sleeping for about 5 minutes before falling asleep (see video #1). When activated, SCP-542 appears to retain some ability to sense its surroundings; it will occasionally move about and touch objects nearby as if searching for something. Video documentation shows that testing personnel do not experience any discomfort from this sequence.</p><p>Upon waking up from sleep paralysis, SCP-542's anomalous effects will last at least half an hour before ceasing to function. Throughout this time, the user may be able to see other people and pets close by through their bedroom ceiling or windows (see video #2). Upon attempting to exit the room, or when leaving Site-74, SCP-542's anomalous effects will cease to function, with users recovering consciousness in their beds. If a person is discovered utilizing SCP-542 after being trapped inside their residence by SCP-542's anomalous effects for more than an hour, Foundation authorities should be notified immediately.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-542 was recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED]. Testing of SCP-542 is currently suspended due to the possibility of an additional anomalous effect.</p><p><strong>Video #1:</strong> Test Subject reports waking up in bed and entering their bathroom. They are reported to have checked to see if SCP-542 is still on their wrist, but found it to be missing. Camera cuts to a bedroom window. The bedroom window appears to be open. Camera then cuts to a bedroom ceiling, where a small red light can be seen shining through the window. The bedroom ceiling appears to have been painted with water, being temporarily stained by the red light. Camera then cuts to a living room window, where a large red light shines through it. The living room appears to be covered with large patches of water, which appear to be solidified as they fall down the interior walls.</p><p><strong>Video #2:</strong> Camera first enters a bedroom, where a sleeping human is visible through a bedroom ceiling window. The bedroom ceiling appears to be missing its usual paint, and water is visible on the bedroom floor underneath it. Camera then enters an open garage door, which appears to be covered in water. Camera cuts to the lower portion of a porch roof covered in water, then cuts back to the upper portion of the roof, where there is no roof or water at all.']</p>
