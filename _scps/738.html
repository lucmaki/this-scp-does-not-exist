<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-738</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation's Site-77 research facility is to be constructed in the northwest section of Grant County, Oklahoma. The containment procedure for SCP-738 when active is unknown, as it is currently stagnant. Therefore, its containment procedures are temporary until more information about its containment becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-738 is the designation for the Oklahoma oilfield in Grant County, Oklahoma, USA. It was given this designation on ██/██/19██. It has been undeveloped and uninhabited since its discovery.</p><p>SCP-738 possesses a mechanical system that is currently inactive, but could potentially be reactivated by an unknown means. SCP-738's mechanical system is composed of devices that are what are known as differentials: a device used to measure changes in pressure and fluids. The devices appear to be similar to those that are used in gasoline pumps, however they require no fuel or power source.</p><p>The main differential device appears to have time and date stamps engraved on it. When activated, SCP-738's system will begin counting down the time remaining until it reaches zero. This countdown can be stopped by destroying one of the devices (see Addendum 738.1).</p>
