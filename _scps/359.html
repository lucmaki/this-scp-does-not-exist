<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-359</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-359 is contained within a standard containment locker in Site-18's Sector-28. The locker is suitably fitted with an emergency toaster oven, toilet, and refrigerator should it be required for testing purposes.</p><p>Any unauthorized personnel found entering the area beyond this point are to be considered hostile. Any personnel entering the area uninvited are to be treated as biohazardous waste and will be disposed of safely if deemed necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-359 is a standard circular toaster, measuring 30 cm in circumference and 37 cm in height. The toaster has one metallic lever extending from its top, approximately 15 cm long and 8 cm wide.</p><p>The lever can be pulled down with considerable effort, but once released it will return to the up position without any external force applied. In addition to this, the lever cannot be pulled again once it is down; experimentation has shown that pulling it twice consecutively will result in the lever breaking off of the toaster.</p><p>When a normal piece of bread is placed on the toander, it will remain there until removed. When the toaster is dropped or physically tampered with in some way other than by pulling the lever, the bread will disappear without a trace.</p><p>In an attempt to replicate SCP-359's anomalous effect, a D-Class personnel was given permission to remove his favorite slice of bread from his home's toaster and place it into SCP-359. During the process, he unexpectedly opened SCP-359's lid with magically teleporting hands to retrieve the bread before closing it again. Instantly thereafter, his body vanished with no trace left behind as would typically occur when a person dies. The bread upon being placed within SCP-359 had never been removed from the toaster prior. However, several minutes past before anyone noticed that "D-████" was no longer present among their ranks.</p><p>Dr. ██████: So… you think this is all a coincidence?</p><p>D-████████: Dude I'm serious; I've seen this movie before!</p><p>Dr. ██████: What movie are we talking about here?</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
