<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-359</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-359 is contained within a standard containment locker in Site-18's Sector-28. The locker is suitably fitted with an emergency toaster oven, toilet, and refrigerator should it be required for testing purposes.</p><p>Any unauthorized personnel found entering the area beyond this point are to be considered hostile. Any personnel entering the area uninvited are to be treated as biohazardous waste and will be disposed of safely if deemed necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-359 is a standard circular toaster, measuring 30 cm in circumference and 37 cm in height. The toaster has one metallic lever extending from its top, approximately 15 cm long and 8 cm wide.</p><p>The lever can be pulled down with considerable effort, but once released it will return to the up position without any external force applied. In addition to this, the lever cannot be pulled again once it is down; experimentation has shown that pulling it twice consecutively will result in the lever breaking off of the toaster.</p><p>When a normal piece of bread is placed on the toander, it will remain there until removed. When the toaster is dropped or physically tampered with in some way other than by pulling the lever, the bread will disappear without a trace.</p><p>In an attempt to replicate SCP-359's anomalous effect, a D-Class personnel was given permission to remove his favorite slice of bread from his home's toaster and place it into SCP-359. During the process, he unexpectedly opened SCP-359's lid with magically teleporting hands to retrieve the bread before closing it again. Instantly thereafter, his body vanished with no trace left behind as would typically occur when a person dies. The bread upon being placed within SCP-359 had never been removed from the toaster prior. However, several minutes past before anyone noticed that "D-████" was no longer present among their ranks.</p><p>Dr. ██████: So… you think this is all a coincidence?</p><p>D-████████: Dude I'm serious; I've seen this movie before!</p><p>Dr. ██████: What movie are we talking about here?</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Testing on SCP-359 is pending approval by the Ethics Committee. Approval has been granted for limited testing, involving D-Class personnel, on the condition that any resulting anomalies be reported to the Foundation. Testing on SCP-359 will be carried out in a secure testing area with at least two (2) security personnel present at all times. A thorough description of SCP-359\'s properties and its anomalous effect is included below.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-359 is currently in use as a toaster in Sector-28. During the initial acquisition of SCP-359, it was found in the possession of an unidentified individual who had purchased it from ████████\'s department store. The object was subsequently confiscated along with several other items from the store and brought to Site-18 for further investigation.</p><p>A thorough investigation of SCP-359 by Dr. ██████ revealed that it was able to produce a "toast" when placed within its confines, but this "toast" would instantly disappear upon being removed from the toaster. This effect was not observed when the toaster\'s lever was pulled down, though it could not be determined whether this was an effect of SCP-359 itself or due to some other cause.</p>
