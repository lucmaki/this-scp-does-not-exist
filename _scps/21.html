<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-21</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-21 is kept in a standard containment locker at Site ██, which requires standard non-anomalous access control measures. Only three (3) personnel are allowed to handle SCP-21.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-21 is an umbrella comprised of a woven bark cloth cover and a wooden shaft. The cloth cover has been dyed a bright red, symbolizing the family name of its artisan, ██████ ██, ████ ████, who passed away in 1859.</p><p>Under normal conditions, SCP-21 is incapable of opening. Attached to the tip of the shaft are a collection of small black pins that are used to open the cloth cover. At this point it will become capable of opening and will remain so for approximately thirty (30) minutes.</p><p>SCP-21 was recovered on ██/██/19██ when it was spotted by Mobile Task Force Pi-8 ("Sons of Liberty") agents outside [REDACTED] in north western Alabama. Agents were attempting to arrest individuals involved in the [REDACTED], the largest land swindle in US history. Six members of MTF Pi-8 were killed during this operation before SCP-21 was recovered.</p><p>During testing, SCP-21 will open once per day at 11:32 AM Pacific Standard Time between [REDACTED].</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
