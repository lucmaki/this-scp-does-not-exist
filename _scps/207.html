<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-207</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-207 is currently contained within a reinforced cell located in Sector B6-3a of Site-54, which has been equipped with a tracking device. The cell doors are to remain locked at all times, and only personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher are to be given access to the cell.</p><p>All persons exposed to SCP-207's effects must be positioned within sight of an Ethics Committee member at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-207 is a series of five books, collectively titled The Keeper. The books are each composed of small sections stitched together by thread. From these sections, large quantities of text can be extracted using an ordinary needle and thread. SCP-207 appears to have been created by a collective of SCPologists, who were presumably involved in its containment.</p><p>SCP-207's effects manifest when any person who has viewed the books for more than three minutes or so begins reading them. During this period, all sensory input relating to the outside world is blocked. The subject will also perceive their surroundings as a large room with multiple doors leading off into other rooms throughout it. These doors will be opened at random by the entity reading the books. Whenever one of these doors is opened, various characters belonging to various fictional universes are observed interacting with each other. They will do so while stating that they have moved to a new world (hence SCP-207's designation).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 207-1:</strong></p><p>While the effects of SCP-207 can be used to gain information on a surprisingly large number of fictional universes, the random nature of its doors means that it is impossible to access any information beyond the universe of origin. The systems that produce SCP-207 do not appear to have been designed to allow multiple access points. However, due to the large quantity of information extracted from SCP-207\'s books, an enormous amount of data has been collected thus far.</p><p>Over one thousand universes have been cataloged by Foundation agents and researchers working with SCP-207. The first 500 of these universes are detailed below, with brief analysis on the reasons behind their creation.</p><p><strong>Universe 1:</strong> The Mushroom Kingdom</p><p>The Mushroom Kingdom is populated by a species of sentient mushrooms, known as the Mushroom People. They have a complex social hierarchy, and live in a city called Mushroom Town. Each individual has several distinct personalities, which are determined by the person\'s occupation.</p><p>The Mushroom People are governed by a monarchy headed by King Mario and Princess Peach. Their civilization is divided into several different classes, including farmers and businessmen, who run their respective businesses for profit.</p><p>Mario and Peach have two children; Luigi, their oldest son, and Princess Daisy, who was born after Daisy\'s mother died in childbirth. Daisy\'s father was never found after he left her mother, and she has never spoken of her father to anyone.</p><p><strong>Universe 2:</strong> The Lego Universe</p><p>The Lego Universe is populated by sentient toys known as Legos. These Legos form societies based around the construction of structures with other Legos. The nation most prominent in this universe is Freeville; its president is Lord Bricksford, and its capital city is dubbed "Legoland".</p><p>The planet itself is covered in Legomarino, an indestructible material capable of carrying hundreds of pounds of weight. It can also be used as a conductor for electricity and sound waves, although the latter effect would be negligible at the scale of planets.</p><p>Freeville\'s society consists entirely of white Legos with green faces; those with black faces or yellow bricks are considered aliens and not allowed residence in Freeville. Most alien races are discriminated against due to their lack of white faces; if they are not exterminated as soon as possible, they will become assimilated after a period of time has passed. Only three alien races have managed to avoid this fate so far: the Krelboyn, who trade with Freeville via a network of underground tunnels; the Microsaurians, who travel in small spaceships; and the Vortigoids, who live on the highest points on Freeville\'s surface.</p><p><strong>Universe 3:</strong> The Laputa Universe</p><p>The Laputa Universe is populated by sentient floating islands known as Laputans. The Laputans are descended from humans who were isolated in space during an intergalactic war between two races named Orbix and Gullivera. The two races never met directly during the war due to their mutual distaste for each other; all contact between them was made through intermediaries such as the Orbix-Gulliveran League for Peace and Mutual Interests (PLEMI). PLEMI became infamous for its crimes against humanity and was eventually destroyed when its operatives attempted to poison a message destined for the Gulliveran homeworld.</p><p>All humans on Laputa died out shortly after the war ended; only a few non-human races survived on Laputa\'s surface. These include giant birds known as Zapaflies and small humanoids known as Forellies. Forellies have developed into sapient beings over time, and now refer to themselves as Laputans rather than humans because they no longer feel they belong to either race. The Zapaflies became intelligent animals due to their high intelligence and ability to speak several languages.</p><p>Laputa is divided into four main continents: North Island (known as Paratango), South Island (known as Kaidus), East Island (known as Gil), and West Island (known as Thalambia). The continent closest to Laputa\'s surface is North Island; this continent contains most of Laputa\'s cities and major population centers. South Island contains most of Laputa\'s farmland and natural resources (including water). East Island is home to most Forellie settlements; it also contains an unknown number of Forellie ruins dating from before humans arrived on Laputa. West Island is largely oceanic in nature; it contains no major population centers or nations.</p><p>Slightly over 4% of citizens possess porcelain masks that hide their faces behind them (the actual percentage varies depending on country); these citizens are referred to as "masked". The masked are given special privileges in exchange for their assistance in keeping secret the locations of various valuable resources hidden throughout Laputa. Whenever a masked citizen dies (usually in combat with other masked citizens), their porcelain mask is broken in half - a fragment will usually be taken by an individual loyal to whoever currently holds power on Laputa during that time period. This custom has led to many political assassinations being carried out by individuals loyal to different factions within pre-civilization societies on Laputa.</p>
