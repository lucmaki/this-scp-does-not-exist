<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-220</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-220 is kept at Containment Area-3 for study purposes. All personnel interacting with SCP-220 are to wear Level 2 Hazmat suits and at least 1.5 meters of reinforced Kevlar. A 6 meter safety buffer distance is maintained from SCP-220 at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-220 is an empty cage. Despite the fact that it has been completely emptied, the cage remains full of air. The walls and floor remain unbroken despite this. SCP-220 was found in a large nearby mansion owned by █████ █████████.</p><p>When opened, SCP-220 allows people to walk through it freely. However, if closed, they will find that they are unable to leave and have no way to communicate with anyone outside the facility. This effect is otherwise identical to that of a standard door. It is recommended that personnel use digital devices at all times when interacting with SCP-220. The digital devices used must be able to withstand the effects of an unplugged USB port while still functioning.</p><p>SCP-220 appears normal at first glance: It weighs 50 kilograms, measures 5 meters long and 3 meters high, and is constructed from steel wires, wood, plastic, and glass windows stacked together in a rectangular shape. When opened, however, it reveals a spacious space behind it; here are several pieces of furniture and two beds for testing purposes. All testing on SCP-220 must be performed inside of Containment Area-3 only; any attempts to test SCP-220 outside of Containment Area-3 will result in disastrous consequences for either the test subjects or attendants within Containment Area-3 itself.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Interview Log 220-01</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ████</p><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-220</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Good morning, SCP-220.</p><p><strong>SCP-220:</strong> Mmm? What are you doing here? I thought you guys were meant to keep me locked up in that big cage of yours!</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Uh… we've been having difficulties with your containment, SCP-220. We're working on it, though.</p><p><strong>SCP-220:</strong> That's not what I heard! You said you were keeping me in a cage! A big cage! What's going on? You don't even like me, do you?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Uh… well… I don't know what else to say.</p><p><strong>SCP-220:</strong> Well, this is all very embarrassing. I don't want to be a bother anymore. If you can't keep me locked up properly, then just throw me out of the window again. Sorry if it's a problem.</p><p><End Log></p>
