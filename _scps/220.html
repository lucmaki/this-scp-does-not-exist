<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-220</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-220 is kept at Containment Area-3 for study purposes. All personnel interacting with SCP-220 are to wear Level 2 Hazmat suits and at least 1.5 meters of reinforced Kevlar. A 6 meter safety buffer distance is maintained from SCP-220 at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-220 is an empty cage. Despite the fact that it has been completely emptied, the cage remains full of air. The walls and floor remain unbroken despite this. SCP-220 was found in a large nearby mansion owned by █████ █████████.</p><p>When opened, SCP-220 allows people to walk through it freely. However, if closed, they will find that they are unable to leave and have no way to communicate with anyone outside the facility. This effect is otherwise identical to that of a standard door. It is recommended that personnel use digital devices at all times when interacting with SCP-220. The digital devices used must be able to withstand the effects of an unplugged USB port while still functioning.</p><p>SCP-220 appears normal at first glance: It weighs 50 kilograms, measures 5 meters long and 3 meters high, and is constructed from steel wires, wood, plastic, and glass windows stacked together in a rectangular shape. When opened, however, it reveals a spacious space behind it; here are several pieces of furniture and two beds for testing purposes. All testing on SCP-220 must be performed inside of Containment Area-3 only; any attempts to test SCP-220 outside of Containment Area-3 will result in disastrous consequences for either the test subjects or attendants within Containment Area-3 itself.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
