<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-214</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-214 is to be held in a standard Safe-class containment locker at Site 9. Any and all unauthorized handling of SCP-214 is to be logged and reviewed by the site's security staff. The following actions constitute unauthorized handling:</p><p>Any and all handling or manipulation of SCP-214 that cannot be directly verified as part of an authorized experiment carried out by Level 1 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-214 is a pair of inflatable latex handball gloves saturated with liquid latex. The object was recovered from the University of Miami, following an incident in which two fraternities were subject to amnesticization and blockage of their use of SCP-214. The fraternities in question were Sigma Alpha Epsilon (male) and Sigma Chi (male); the former was suspected of using SCP-214 to cheat during football games against rival fraternities.</p><p>The label on each glove reads "For a Funtime Experience." The label also contains a phone number that, when called, produces the sound of rustling paper. Attempting to call the number again results in the sound of a muffled phone conversation. Further testing with this number has revealed nothing further.</p><p>Each glove is filled with approximately ██████ ("ccs") worth of liquid latex. Upon exiting the glove, this liquid will cling to whatever surface it comes in contact with; however if its surface is not smooth enough for normal adhesion, it will instead produce a large hole by means of thermal conduction when left exposed for more than 5 seconds. Once exposed, liquid latex will begin to evaporate from its surface at an alarming rate until its original value of cc's is reached; it then becomes inert.</p><p>SCP-214 was recovered at [REDACTED] due to [REDACTED], after a fraternity house run by SAE was raided by local police under the suspicion that it had been using SCP-214 to cheat during their interfraternity football games. However investigations into members' backgrounds revealed that they did not have access to SCP-214 or any other prohibited item; upon being questioned by agents investigating into possible cheating at other fraternities, they reported hearing rumors of "Incredible Handballs" as a means of cheating among members.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of the phone conversation, taken from a wiretapped phone call.</p><p><strong>President:</strong> [inaudible]</p><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Yeah, I'm definitely in the middle of something right now.</p><p><strong>President:</strong> We need to talk</p><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> Well, we can talk after I finish up.</p><p><strong>President:</strong> You can't cheat.</p><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> I know you won't like this, but we've been doing this for years. It's the only way we have to compete with other fraternities.</p><p><strong>President:</strong> You can't do it anymore. We're kicking you out if you don't stop</p><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> I can't believe you're doing this to us. This is a slap in the face.</p><p><strong>President:</strong> Okay, I'm sorry. You have 24 hours to get out of here. After that, we're going to trace all your calls and find out who you're talking to</p><p><strong>Unknown:</strong> You don't understand</p><p><strong>President:</strong> Just…just go."]</p>
