<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-975</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-975 is to be kept in a secure cell at Sector-71. SCP-975 is to be fed and watered twice daily, as well as medically evaluated twice weekly. If SCP-975 shows any signs of health or mental impairment, it is to be sent to the medical wing for evaluation. No personnel may enter SCP-975's cell without Level 4 approval; this includes log review for any entries made by SCP-975.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-975 is a humanoid entity of unknown species. It appears to be female, and has several minor signs of age. The entity stands at 2.6 meters tall and weighs 95 kilograms. SCP-975's body is covered in what appears to be some sort of durable fur, but nothing matching any known animal has been identified.</p><p>SCP-975 demonstrates an extremely aggressive behavior towards all personnel, regardless of origin or gender. A level 4 authorization is required for any personnel that enters its cell unless it is for the purpose of testing or medical care.</p><p>SCP-975 appears to have a keen sense of smell, and can locate a person from over 500 meters away. It is highly resistant to death, and has been reported to travel great distances to attack any would-be attackers.</p><p>SCP-975 exhibits no signs of intelligence, but is capable of learning simple skills. It will not follow instructions, and displays no desire to learn or obey rules; however, it can understand simple commands such as "stay here", "open the door", and "get out". It will also show interest in certain activities, such as chess and watching television.</p><p>SCP-975 was discovered in ██████ City, Russia on ██/██/██ after numerous reports of mysterious homeless people being beaten and killed by large groups of people in the area (See Incident Log 975). It was taken into Foundation custody after approximately 2 hours of being located by local police officers. No history of SCP-975's identity has been found. It has proven impossible to communicate with SCP-975 via normal means. Attempts at communication via written notes have proven futile, as SCP-975 appears to have no understanding of written words; however, SCP-975 seems to understand the concept behind written words despite no reading ability or memory.</p>
