<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-397</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-397 is kept under constant observation by a minimum of two security personnel at all times. At least one of these personnel must be equipped with a Class-C radio and have immediate access to the main office in order to be notified of any new releases. All instances of SCP-397 are to be stored in a Class 5 biohazardous containment chamber with no light or other sensory inputs. Any media containing SCP-397 is to be confiscated, destroyed, or stored until it expires. Any unauthorized individuals attempting to contact SCP-397 are not to be allowed to do so unless it is for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-397 is a brand of plastic hangers manufactured by ██████. SCP-397 will randomly manifest out of the packaging and begin to animate, becoming autonomous under the effects of dim light. It is currently unknown how this phenomenon occurs, as it has not been shown to act outside of its packaging or in areas with no light. Instances are capable of locomotion, but prefer to engage in non-violent behavior such as sitting on a shelf or table and swaying back and forth.</p><p>Instances will differentiate themselves from other objects by their unique shape and color scheme, with most instances having a white exterior and one shade of blue within the interior. The packaging can be used as a makeshift container for instances.</p><p>When not engaged in movement, instances lack purpose and will sit around in an inactive manner until immersed in brighter light. If brightness is raised enough for them to see, they will be drawn to any new sources of light such as flashlights and screens unless otherwise directed by personnel. Instances have shown remarkable intelligence with the ability to synthesize tools out of items such as forks and paperclips under the correct conditions.</p><p>SCP-397's anomalous properties were discovered when the first instance was released into the main office while two personnel were attending to a press release on their containment procedures. Multiple instances were released throughout the building, leading to damage in several rooms but causing no injuries. Further testing revealed that SCP-397 can communicate through radio waves with certain frequencies that are only active in relatively dark areas. SCP-397 displays a high degree of intelligence, but has limited speech capabilities due to the nature of its mouth being on the underside of its body instead of inside its mouth like other mammalian species would have (See audio log 997a).</p><p>A number of instances have spontaneously appeared outside of Foundation containment at various locations including [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] after disruptions that occurred due to an undisclosed incident at Site ██ involving interference from forces unknown to most personnel (See audio log 997b). These events have not yet been linked definitively to SCP-397; however, several deaths have been reported as well as widespread property damage, which ISOLATION/INTERDICTION efforts have thus far failed to prevent from occurring again.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Following the discovery of SCP-397, several attempts to isolate and contain it have been made. While this has worked in most cases, it has also led to the loss of personnel (See audio log 997c). The following is a transcript of SCP-397's first recorded conversation with a Foundation researcher.</p><p><hr></p><p>[A researcher is speaking with an instance of SCP-397 through their radio.]</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Hello? Can you hear me?</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> [Is heard making a static noise.]</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Can you understand me?</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> [Is heard making a static noise.]</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Can you say anything?</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> [Is heard making a static noise.]</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Hello? Is anyone there?</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> [Is heard making a static noise.]</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> What the fuck are you?</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> [Is heard making a static noise.]</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> You're not saying anything. I can't hear you.</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> [Is heard making a static noise.]</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to communicate with me? What do you want from me? Is this some kind of prank?</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> [Is heard making a static noise.]</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> I'm serious. What is going on here? Is this part of your containment procedures or what? C'mon, talk to me. I gave you food and water. I've given you everything you want and now you're just sitting here doing nothing. Is this some sort of game or something? Are you trying to get me to talk to you?! Who the fuck are you? Answer me! C'mon, talk to me!</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> [Is heard making a static noise.]"]</p>
