<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-519</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-519 is to be contained in a standardized containment cell at Site-██. Standard humanoid environmental systems are to be maintained within SCP-519's containment cell, with SCP-519's effects disabled before entering it. SCP-519 is to be fed a diet consisting of organic grains and seeds upon entering containment. Any other expenses or requirements needed for its containment are to be paid for by the Foundation out of general budget expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-519 is a humanoid, non-anomalous entity. Apart from its anomalous properties, SCP-519 appears to be healthy and physically well-developed for a human between the ages of 25 and 35.</p><p>SCP-519 will organize its clothing into two separate layers: a top layer and an inner layer. The top layer will include jackets, shirts, pants, and other material that would be considered suitable outerwear. The inner layer will consist of various rags or other materials necessary to maintain the smoothness of SCP-519's skin. These layers can be rearranged at any time.</p><p>The outer layer of SCP-519's body has a lifespan before succumbing to deterioration similar to that of tissue cultured stem cells. Due to this, SCP-519 has no limit to the number of times it can change its clothing, as long as its skin remains viable. It appears that SCP-519 does not have any limitations on the amount of clothing it can remove; however, removing more than what would completely cover its body tends to cause some discomfort for SCP-519 if it attempts to do so. When changed into new clothing, SCP-519 will typically discard anything over a few decades old or ill fitting into its wardrobe.</p><p>SCP-519 displays behavior consistent with that of an emotional masochist as detailed in Interview 519/I:</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ████</p><p>Interviewee: SCP-519</p><p>Dr. ████: Let's start by getting you comfortable with physical contact. How about a hug?</p><p>SCP-519: No thank you; I prefer my arms free to move at all times.</p><p>Dr. ████: Alright then…you aren't going to like this question, but I have to ask it anyway…Why do you enjoy pain so much?</p><p>SCP-519: It isn't always pain, I don't mind.[…] I know what I am feeling; I have felt pleasure before also. [pause] In fact, after experiencing pain so many times in one day…it feels good and rewarding when they give up too early and die on me. It is kind of like getting paid for being strong!</p><p>Dr. ████: You are a sadistic monster.*</p><p>SCP-519: Wait! That was just a joke! Just kidding! I'm joking! Just kidding uh? Shit…wha—ahem…[laughter] Okay fine then…I guess I'm kind of a sadist when it comes down to it. Don't judge me![laughter]</p><p>*Note: During this interview, Dr. ████ had been instructed by his superiors not to directly communicate negative emotional states or experiences with SCP-519 unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-519 was first discovered when its anomalous properties were discovered during the cleaning of a containment cell at Site-██. An investigation was carried out after the personnel who found it reported that several feces had made their way into the facility's ventilation system. It was later determined that SCP-519 had been in the containment cell for months, where it had been feeding itself by removing clothing from a number of humanoids. SCP-519's anomalous properties were only discovered after these humanoids died from various causes, leading to suspicion being raised as to SCP-519's cause of death.</p><p>Upon interviewing SCP-519, it was discovered that it was not responsible for the deaths of any of the individuals and, instead, had been helping them through a variety of methods. It is believed that SCP-519 may have caused some of these individual's deaths. This did not appear to be a malicious act on the part of SCP-519 due to the fact that it seemed to have a genuine interest in its victims and was usually very kind to them.</p><p>SCP-519 was kept in containment while an investigation was conducted as to its origins. SCP-519 had no family or other connections to the individuals it fed off of; however, it did seem to have a genuine love for them and wanted to help them in some way during their last days on Earth.</p><p>After this investigation was completed, SCP-519 was moved onto the Foundation's own research facility, Site-██. All efforts have been made to ensure that SCP-519's anomalous properties remain undiscovered by outside parties."]</p>
