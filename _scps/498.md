<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-498</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-498 is to be kept in a locked desk drawer at the Information Security department of Site-77.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-498 is a paperback book entitled "That's What She Said: A Gay Stories of True Love and Romance", written by Dr. Steven J. Segal (aka: Jason Paul Slade), printed in 2010. It is 352 pages long.</p><p>SCP-498 takes the form of a literary anthology, containing numerous short stories about homosexual relationships between men, women, and transgenders. Each story is formatted as an ePub file and attached to this object as a read file. The original text of the stories can be retrieved from Dr. Segal's website at http://www.jasonpaulslade.com/.</p><p>SCP-498 does not have any anomalous properties outside of its effect on the subject reading it; however, reading SCP-498 causes significant cognitive dissonance among the reader, if they are commonly heterosexual or bisexual.</p><p>If the reader has been exposed to sexuality or pornography that involves persons of the same sex before reading SCP-498, they will become significantly more uncomfortable with their sexual orientation following exposure to SCP-498. This discomfort may manifest itself in an increased interest in homosexuality or other nonheterosexual sexualities and an aversion to sex with persons that they were previously attracted to; however, these effects are not specific to homosexuals or bisexuals and affect heterosexuals as well. Cases have been reported where heterosexual males have become obsessed with homosexual culture after reading SCP-498, leading to several unsuccessful attempts at homosexual intercourse.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following excerpts from "That\'s What She Said" may be helpful in understanding the effects of SCP-498:</p><p>"I\'ll admit it. I\'ve never been a fan of women. It\'s not that I dislike them, or anything like that; it\'s just that they have always seemed a bit too… girly for me. Sure, they\'re beautiful and all, but they never really made me feel sexy. It was always more like, \'Wow! Another girl on my penis!\' It\'s not that I don\'t understand why women do what they do. They are born that way and will always want to please their man. But I just can\'t get into it."</p><p>"Although I knew she was very beautiful, I had no idea just how beautiful she was. We had just finished making love for the first time, and I was sitting up in bed, taking a break to drink some fresh water. When I looked down at her naked body, it took my breath away. She was just so… perfect. Her skin was so pale, almost translucent, and her nipples were pink and hard."</p><p>"I didn\'t know how it happened, but suddenly my mouth was on hers. It felt so good to finally kiss a woman again. The way she moaned into my mouth sent shivers down my spine, and I could feel her hands running through my hair."</p><p>"She reached down between our bodies and began touching herself. It wasn\'t until then that I realized I was naked as well."</p><p>"Her hand cupped my balls gently as she slid her fingers up and down my shaft. She teased me by rubbing her thumb over the tip of my cock ever so lightly."</p><p>"I lifted her into the air and laid her on the bed. Her legs fluttered open as I sank deep inside of her slowly."</p><p>"I could feel it building up inside of her; she had never been so wet and responsive before. I could see her tits jiggling up and down as she rode me hard."</p><p>"When we were done making love, we laid back in each other\'s arms and talked about what had happened. She confessed to me that she really hadn\'t expected to enjoy it as much as she did; after all, she\'d only been with men before."</p><p>"I couldn\'t believe it. She wasn\'t even gay! Turns out she\'d been cheating on her boyfriend with me all along."</p><p>"Our relationship lasted for years. We were together every day, even when we weren\'t making love. It was amazing how comfortable we seemed being together like this; we had gotten used to kissing each other every time we saw each other."</p><p>"One day, however, things started to change between us. Our sex life began to be less frequent than before, and she kept saying things like \'we should go out sometime,\' or \'we should find a new place to go.\' I had no idea what was going on at first; then one day, she admitted she didn\'t want to be with me anymore."']</p>
