<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-310</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-310 instances are to be contained in a separate containment unit at Site-23. The area of the containment chamber should be cleared of all unnecessary materials, such as the entirety of the Foundation's supply of paper clips.</p><p>The area of the containment chamber is to be illuminated by artificial light only; all windows are to be closed and sealed with reinforced glass. The lighting within the containment chamber is to be switched on at 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time and off at 10:00 PM Eastern Standard Time every day.</p><p>If an instance of SCP-310 breaks containment, security personnel are to request local authorities intervene and take control of the instance in question. If this is not possible, additional Foundation personnel are to approach the object to ensure it is secure.</p><p>SCP-310-4 is under the observation of Level 4 personnel and no more than one personnel at a time may approach it. The purpose of Level 4 observation is to prevent nearby staff from being affected by SCP-310 instances.</p><p>Any staff members who have recently been exposed to SCP-310 are to undergo psychological examination for any signs or symptoms of being affected by one or more instances; if these symptoms prove to be present, they are to be removed from cover and placed in temporary containment. No permanent physical changes should occur from this removal; however, any psychological changes should be treated with care and monitored for complications.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-310 is the collective designation for all instances of SCP-310-1. Instances of SCP-310-1 are usually caused by the sudden unexpected mechanical breakage of complex electronic devices, including desktop computers, laptops, and televisions.</p><p>Testing has proven that time spent in direct proximity to an instance of SCP- 310-1 does not result in damage sustained by the subject; however, prolonged exposure to an instance can lead to severe agitation, delirium, and obsessive behavior. Individuals affected by this condition may attempt to recover a lost instance or find another one. If an individual attempts to perform any action that could cause harm to either themselves or others they are deemed "in addition" and must be immediately captured and removed from contact with any additional instances.</p><p>Note: Level 4 personnel under observation during testing were not removed from coverage until after five minutes of being near an instance of SCP-310 when the test was halted. No other staff were allowed to approach the test area after this point, due to the risk of further damage to already exposed subjects.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 310-1:</strong> Notes from Dr. ████████, who was recently assigned to SCP-310:</p><p>You can't really understand this stuff unless you've seen it with your own eyes. I've never been so scared in my life. The poor bastard… he was just sitting there, looking at the screen. Not even blinking. Just staring. It was like he couldn't look away. Even when I had the thing in my hand and I could see the blood… he didn't blink a single time. Like he was hypnotized or something.</p><p>I don't know what this thing is or how it works. But it makes me want to be as far away from it as possible. I don't even know if I'm sane right now, you know? I didn't sleep last night, and I'm not sure what's real anymore. All I know is that… we've got to get this thing out of here. This is a safe site; it doesn't make any sense that it could still be here after all these years.</p><p>I don't think anyone else has ever gotten this close to an instance of SCP-310-1. They're too afraid of it, and that's not good for anybody. We should be more careful about this kind of thing, especially when we're dealing with something like this…</p><p>To: O-██</p><p><strong>From:</strong> Dr. ████████</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-310-1</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> File Transfer Request</p><p><strong>Item:</strong> SCP-310-1</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-23</p><p><strong>Approval:</strong> O-██"]</p>
