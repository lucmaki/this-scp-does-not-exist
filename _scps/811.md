<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-811</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-811 is currently contained in a humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-811's cell is to be equipped with three (3) intravenous lines and an animal water bottle. There are to be no more than four (4) personnel in the vicinity of SCP-811's cell at any one time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-811 is a humanoid entity appearing to be between the ages of 13 and 16 years old. SCP-811 appears to be a Caucasian female, with the exception that it possesses dark brown hair which grows down to its thighs and its pupils are a pitch black similar to a cat's. It also possesses four (4) long claws on its fingers and toes. SCP-811's clothing does not adhere to any known standards of fashion and appears to be torn and tattered.</p><p>SCP-811 is capable of moving at speeds exceeding 200 km/h, performing acrobatics and traversing great heights by swinging from buildings or trees. SCP-811 can climb over 1,000 feet in 15 minutes, and has been observed leaping 1.5 times its height. In addition to this, SCP-811 has been seen "flying" through the air by flapping its wings much faster than humans could flap them. SCP-811 is able to glide down from great heights without sustaining injuries due to wind resistance. When walking, SCP-811 becomes extremely agitated. This has resulted in several violent incidents where it had broken through containment cells and severely injured personnel as well as other secluded areas within Site ██.</p><p>When speaking verbally, SCP-811 speaks with an affected Southern American accent and frequently makes dog barks or growls which sound like phrases such as "Bone" or "Pit".</p><p>SCP-811 has a large collection of different objects given to it by various individuals throughout the years. Most of these items appear normal and are able to function normally. However, some have proven anomalous with their properties:</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 811-1:</strong> Upon discovery by SCP-███, SCP-811 was discovered in a large building. SCP-811 had been living in the basement of the building for at least 7 years. Upon discovery, SCP-811 attacked all personnel at Site ██ and inflicted severe trauma upon several researchers. It was subdued after being shot with a tranquilizer dart.']</p>
