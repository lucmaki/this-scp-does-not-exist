<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-248</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-248 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit. No individual has been permitted entrance to the containment chamber for study of the anomaly, as testing of any type can have extremely unpredictable results. Any personnel wishing access to SCP-248 for testing purposes must report for testing at least one week in advance.</p><p>SCP-248 may not have any sharp or pointed objects in its cell. This includes but is not limited to: pencils, scissors, knifes, needles, thread and similar objects. Failure to comply with this regulation may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-248 is a humanoid entity, approximately 2.5 m in height with the frame of an “average” human male. The anomalous properties of SCP-248 are that it does not age past a specific age (See attached document for details). The precise nature of the anomaly is as yet unknown.</p><p>SCP-248 shows no signs of any disease, illness, or normal wear and tear on the body. It is apparent that SCP-248 does not require food, water, or rest. However, it does show some degree of fatigue when studied closely (See attached photo). It should be noted that there is no evidence that this specimen is capable of “sleeping” in any sense of the word.</p><p>The most obvious feature of SCP-248 is its lack of several relatively common senses. These include visual, olfactory and tactile. There have been no recorded instances where SCP-248 has been able to perceive certain aspects in this manner. Although other senses such as thermal have never been tested on SCP-248, it is theorized that if they were available the organism would have activated them at some point in time during the aforementioned time frame.</p><p>SCP-248 displays some behavioral patterns which are almost identical to those exhibited by children between ages 0 and approximately 5 years old. The organism emits a high pitched giggle when it is fed a large snack. During this period, it will also engage in very small talk with other adult staff members and attempt to play games with them (See attached image for comparison).</p><p>SCP-248 came to the Foundation's attention after local media reported an attempted kidnapping involving a young child in ██████, ██ on ██/██/1965 (See attachment ███-██), which resulted in his disappearance along with the kidnapper(s). As such, the case was placed under Foundation investigation and SCP-248 was brought into custody.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
