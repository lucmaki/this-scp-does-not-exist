<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-46</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-46 is stored in a standard containment locker. The door to this locker has been fitted with a visual and motion sensor, with no interior room larger than 1m2. The door must be left open at all times, except following an evacuation procedure. SCP-46 must not be removed from its containment locker for any reason, and may only be used for testing purposes by Level 2 personnel.</p><p>SCP-46 is now housed in Site-15. Personnel assigned to Site 15 have been briefed on the nature of SCP-46 and instructed to do nothing more than report changes in the item's behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-46 is an xylophone, in a wooden box. The xylophone is made of a variety of materials and is constructed in the style of classical Greek or Roman models. SCP-46 has been dated to the late 19th century based on its style of construction and the fact that it bears no marks of any kind, either during or after its creation.</p><p>When played by itself, SCP-46 will produce music close to that of the standard xylophone. However, when placed near another object, it will begin playing on that object's pitch. By placing an object on SCP-46 and then removing it, it can be heard playing on the pitch of any other similar instrument. For example, if one holds a bassoon under SCP-46 and then pulls it away, it will play on standard bassoon pitch for one second before returning to its original pitch.</p><p>Discovery Log: D-935534 was transferred to Site-15 around September 9th, 1998 with the intent of involving him in a program designed to improve his attitude toward his fellow Foundation staff members. The experiment failed within 2 weeks when D-935534 began to exhibit erratic behavior, including a very vocal dislike of Foundation personnel and their work. A series of interviews ensued between D-935534 and Dr. ████████; during these interviews, D-935534 began to make claims about SCP-46 being haunted by him and his deceased grandparents. After several months, attempts at getting D-935534 sent outside his cell resulted in him becoming agitated and refusing to answer questions until leaving Site 15.</p><p>On September 28th, 1998, D-935534 was brought back into contact with SCP-46 with no warnings or unusual behavior from him afterward. After two minutes with the item, D-935534 reported the death of his grandfather, who had been cremated shortly before he was brought into Foundation custody. This change in behavior lasted for roughly two weeks; following this period, D-935534 became amiable once again and returned to previous levels of interaction with personnel other than Dr. ████████. It is currently believed that SCP-46 is capable of replicating events that took place within Foundation custody during this time period.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 46-1:</strong> Following the incident with D-935534, a number of new tests were conducted on SCP-46 with personnel that had not been involved with D-935534's case. Additionally, researchers have begun to do research into other methods of use for SCP-46, in order to see if there are any other effects. However, no new findings have arisen from these tests."]</p>
