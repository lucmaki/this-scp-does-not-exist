<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-1</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A cover story has been released indicating the suspected disappearance of SCP-1, in order to hide its anomalous nature. Any reports of SCP-1 found outside Foundation facilities are to be taken as unrelated</p><p>SCP-1 must never be approached by non-Foundation personnel, and Foundation personnel are not allowed to come close to it for any reason. Any personnel approaching on their own initiative are to be given amnestics immediately following discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1 is a large, abstractly shaped building with no discernible entry or exit. At any time there may be as many as 730 instances of SCP-1 in existence at any given time. SCP-1 were originally known as "The Infinite Building" in the early 1990s, belonging to the artist ██████ ███████████ (aka █████████████).</p><p>SCP-1 changes shape and appearance at random, although this change seems to be fairly consistent depending on how long it remains in an inactive state. When in active states of both current and previous forms, SCP-1 has the ability to generate reports by writing on its walls. These reports are taken as being written by various anomalous individuals and entities, including members of the SCP Foundation itself.</p><p>It is believed that the original form of SCP-1 was a seven hour tour of SCP ██████████'s art studio, which was redeveloped into a more permanent facility at some point around 2005.</p>
<p> <strong>['Appendix A:</strong> SCP-1 was first discovered on December ██, 2004, when its anomalous nature was first noticed by a Foundation researcher. After several reports were made of its existence outside of the art gallery where it was originally discovered, its anomalous nature was officially recognized and it became an SCP in 2008.']</p>
