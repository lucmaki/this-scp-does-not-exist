<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-342</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-342 instances are currently stored in a variety of storage containers. Containment procedures are as follows:</p><p>1) Each container contains three (3) instances of SCP-342, one (1) of which is designated as the primary instance. Each secondary instance is placed within an airtight container with a single sheet of paper and a marker or pen.</p><p>2) If any individual instance of SCP-342 begins to decompose, it is to be recommended that the instance be replaced with a new one immediately.</p><p>3) Observation of each instance is to occur every two days, using custom software designed to extract information related to each of the eight (8) different activities listed for each instance.</p><p>4) Testing of any SCP-342 instance requires written permission from two Level 4 personnel. Testing may only be done if at least one staff member has knowledge of the activity being examined. It is the responsibility of the researcher performing the testing to ensure that all documentation is maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-342 are a set of Post-it jems, of the brand Red Apple. While they appear exactly as they would in a non-anomalous fashion, SCP-342 fail to adhere to any previously known laws of physics. SCP-342 instances are capable of being used as writing implements and markers, and when used in such manners are still capable of displaying anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-342 were discovered during initial cleanup efforts at an abandoned mall in ██████, ██ following reports of various disappearances, and manifestation events including the disappearance of all instances before ███, 2009. Investigation into the circumstances surrounding the manifestation events has revealed no clear cause for the anomalous behavior exhibited by SCP-342, although several theories have been proposed. The Foundation is currently conducting research into theories that can provide a coherent explanation for SCP-342's anomalous properties.</p><p>Aside from their use as writing devices and markers, each instance of SCP-342 appears to be capable of detecting events related to certain activities, including but not limited to:</p><p>SCP-342 also display a very slight reaction to the other instances within its containment container, but trials have shown that this effect is negligible enough to be ignored for most practical purposes. Testing has also determined that two (2) instances can be used without significantly affecting one another.</p>
