<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-553</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe-object</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-553 is maintained in a specially designed 5 m x 5 m containment chamber, located at Site-28. The chamber has been outfitted with two three-point restraining devices for the purpose of restraint, and is equipped with audio recording devices. No personnel are allowed to enter the containment chamber without wearing standard hearing protection.</p><p>The chamber must be cleaned of all genetic material at least once every month, and once a week distilled water must be poured into the bottom of the containment chamber. Any bodily effluvia need to be removed from the area immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-553 is a dromedary camel, which has been identified as the elderly male specimen of the species Camelus dromedary. A tissue sample taken from the animal shows that it has suffered extensive tissue damage consistent with large doses of anthrax, and shows evidence of radiation burns consistent with exposure to NP-1 ("splendid green") radiation. The animal's hide is radioactive and highly toxic, but not nearly as dangerous as the tissue itself.</p><p>SCP-553 possesses a pair of large white eyes, one on each side of its head. The eyes are always looking straight forward at 0° latitude, and never stop blinking. While SCP-553 is awake, it will blink its eyes at a rate of once per second whenever they are not looking directly forward. The blink rate is independent of whether or not an individual has their eyes open. Open eyelids do not significantly affect the blink rate; closed eyelids result in a blink every ten seconds instead of every one second.</p><p>If a human subject looks into the eyes of SCP-553 for more than 1 hour, they will experience symptoms similar to those caused by anthrax exposure in a manner dependent on time spent within SCP-553's field of vision:</p><p>The effect is strongest when looking directly into SCP-553's left eye and weakest when looking directly into its right eye, but repeated exposure to SCP-553 results in less severe and less damaging effects after some period of time. If a subject observes SCP-553 for 2 hours or longer each day over multiple days, they will begin to see SCP-553 as a competent parent figure (see Addendum 555/9)</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 555/9:</strong> Interview Log 555/1</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. H█████</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-553</p><p><strong>Dr. H█████:</strong> Good morning, SCP-553. How are you today?</p><p><strong>SCP-553:</strong> Fine, thank you.</p><p><strong>Dr. H█████:</strong> What is your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-553:</strong> I am SCP-553.</p><p><strong>Dr. H█████:</strong> What is your species?</p><p><strong>SCP-553:</strong> I am a dromedary camel.</p><p><strong>Dr. H█████:</strong> What is your purpose?</p><p><strong>SCP-553:</strong> I am here to take care of the boys who can't take care of themselves. You see, I have eyes that let me see all the way to the horizon, but nobody has eyes like this. So you can trust me to watch over you.</p><p><strong>Dr. H█████:</strong> But you are a camel, not a boy.</p><p><strong>SCP-553:</strong> They are my boys too, Doctor. Just like they're my girls. And I am their dad."]</p>
