<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-180</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-180 are to be contained in cool storage at Site-17. In the case of a fire, all instances of SCP-180 and their documentation will be destroyed; any pre-loaded instances are to be saved for later testing and transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-180 is an artifact management software package developed in the 1980s. As SCP-180 has no other designations, it is currently assumed to be an unapproved product from a private company. The name "SCP-180" was given by the only known user of SCP-180, who does not wish to be identified.</p><p>SCP-180 requires an installation folder on a computer for use. If one exists, it will prompt the user to copy the included files into that folder. A window will appear with a number of options and buttons; selecting any of these options will terminate use of SCP-180.</p><p>Upon first being loaded into a computer, instances of SCP-180 will attempt to locate and display documentation. This documentation can be accessed by any human who has read and understood at least one document in the documentation set. The documentation will only be accessible using this method; attempts at other means (such as photocopying) are ignored and have no effect on access to documentation.</p><p>Documentation provided by SCP-180 was originally written for use by people in the field of software development, but has now been adapted for specialist users such as information security personnel. The documentation includes detailed descriptions of various items which are stored on instances of SCP-180, including documents created by security personnel and information about security measures used by Foundation sites and staff members.</p><p>Unlocking Documentation: A number of documents exist within instances of SCP-180 at all times; all documents must be unlocked before they can be read by anyone but those with clearance to access them. For the purposes of this article, all documents will be referred to as "Special Document One." Special Document One includes protocols for most situations encountered with SCP objects, information on how to request and log checks against some security measures, instructions on how to access Media Scanners, instructions on how to perform many basic functions with SCPs, instructions on countermeasures against certain special threats (see Addendum 1), and a list of Standard Object Numbers (S.O.N.) for objects maintained by various Foundation departments or associated organizations, as well as advice about when such S.O.N.'s should be used in conjunction with specific SCPs.</p><p>The very first Special Document One is described below:</p><p>Protocols for handling incoming requests from outside sources:</p><p>1) Requesting new items via form; do NOT delete existing item if form fails! Reminder: Do NOT poke us with sharp sticks directly!</p><p>2) Requesting items via form (again):(paraphrased) All requests must be logged and archived, pending approval; please include subject's name if filing is made under pseudonym or alias (it becomes difficult later when we do auditing). When requesting item/action, details should include important concepts you expect her/him to deal with…like they are invented here; as you don't have time to write book(s), this helps us keep track and also improves interdepartmental communication regarding risk levels. Also include contact information or I lose half my brain trying untangle piles and chunks from each other!</p><p>3) Logging and archiving all requests via logbook: (paraphrased) Please include subject's name when filing request for action…or else I lose half my brain trying untangle piles and chunks from each other! If there were two subjects involved in event request, tag each one separately….and file both together in case it happens again later – but don't send me mawful things about "dissidents". Their names is(are!) matching tags – do not lie!* (More later.)</p><p>4) Doing counterintelligence work: All actions must go through our own department (or ISC if requested). We have our own opinion too – usually opposite your own – but if we disapprove you'll get punished back at SID without pay…so please wait until we say yes to take extra precautions if something looks fishy.* And no need to go into detail here…I have it all logged anyway!</p><p>For further information regarding terms used within its documentation set refer to Addendum 3.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong></p><p>Several documents exist which instruct the user on how to respond to potential questions and objections by individuals who have read Special Document One. The more these documents contradict Special Document One, the less likely an individual is to have read it.</p><p>Two of these documents are relevant to security personnel and are included below. They provide guidelines on how to respond to potential questions from employees or contractors who have been given access to SCP objects through SCP-180.</p><p>The first document provides a basic "how to" guide for handling unauthorised access attempts to SCP objects via SCP-180.</p><p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Do NOT poke us with sharp sticks directly!</p><p>Re: Object Number [S.O.N.]</p><p>Successful exploitation of SCP-180 requires knowledge of the following S.O.N.s:</p><p>Asset Description (S.O.N.):</p><p>SCP-180 also contains a logbook which records all requests made by users, as well as their responses, when accessing documents. Since its discovery, this log has been used by the Foundation as a tool for storing, sorting and retrieving information (see Addendum 4). Records in the logbook show no evidence of any tampering with the data prior to 1993, but all data added since this time has been altered in some way; all records prior to this point may be considered authentic. This has implications for all users of SCP-180; they should treat any record they find in the logbook as authentic and take care not to cross paths with any records which are later found to be altered.']</p>
