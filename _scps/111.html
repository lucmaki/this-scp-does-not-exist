<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-111</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-111 is a large facility located at the edge of the Dominican Republic, built to house and care for SCP-111 instances. The facility itself is not to be entered except by personnel with level 4 or higher clearance; in addition, all SCP-111 instances are to be observed through security cameras at all times. On the off-chance that an instance of SCP-111 should escape the facility, which has been considered unlikely, armed guards have been placed throughout the area in order to intercept any attempt to escape. Should an instance of SCP-111 exit the facility, it is to be immediately exterminated according to standard Foundation protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-111 is a species of superficially humanoid centauroid with a bizarre morphology that appears to be a cross between an insect and a reptilian mammal. Each instance is about 1.5 meters tall, reaching maximum height around 2 meters, and weighs about 50 kilograms. While it has vestigial arms, these are extremely small relative to the size of the body, and function only for locomotion (the appendages extend from the back rather than the side as human arms would).</p><p>SCP-111 is an intelligent species that is highly social and amicable; each instance communicates with others through chirps, warbling notes and a highly musical language in many different tones and pitches. Interaction with SCP-111 instances appears to be pleasant for both parties involved, though they have been observed to use their anomalous physiology in a very cunning manner; namely, their bodies are covered in highly sensitive sensory organs that are capable of detecting sounds of great volume or intensity, allowing them to hear events they could not otherwise detect.</p><p>Explanatory Statement: After exploring parts of the facility where SCP-111 instances were housed, Dr. Spencer noted what looked like a large storage area filled with containers containing dust. Upon closer examination however, Drs. Spencer and Raty found several instances of SCP-111 inside the containers; these were eventually released into the testing area. No further attempts have been made to capture any SCP-111 instances without Level 4 clearance.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
