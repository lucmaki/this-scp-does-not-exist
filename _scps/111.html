<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-111</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-111 is a large facility located at the edge of the Dominican Republic, built to house and care for SCP-111 instances. The facility itself is not to be entered except by personnel with level 4 or higher clearance; in addition, all SCP-111 instances are to be observed through security cameras at all times. On the off-chance that an instance of SCP-111 should escape the facility, which has been considered unlikely, armed guards have been placed throughout the area in order to intercept any attempt to escape. Should an instance of SCP-111 exit the facility, it is to be immediately exterminated according to standard Foundation protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-111 is a species of superficially humanoid centauroid with a bizarre morphology that appears to be a cross between an insect and a reptilian mammal. Each instance is about 1.5 meters tall, reaching maximum height around 2 meters, and weighs about 50 kilograms. While it has vestigial arms, these are extremely small relative to the size of the body, and function only for locomotion (the appendages extend from the back rather than the side as human arms would).</p><p>SCP-111 is an intelligent species that is highly social and amicable; each instance communicates with others through chirps, warbling notes and a highly musical language in many different tones and pitches. Interaction with SCP-111 instances appears to be pleasant for both parties involved, though they have been observed to use their anomalous physiology in a very cunning manner; namely, their bodies are covered in highly sensitive sensory organs that are capable of detecting sounds of great volume or intensity, allowing them to hear events they could not otherwise detect.</p><p>Explanatory Statement: After exploring parts of the facility where SCP-111 instances were housed, Dr. Spencer noted what looked like a large storage area filled with containers containing dust. Upon closer examination however, Drs. Spencer and Raty found several instances of SCP-111 inside the containers; these were eventually released into the testing area. No further attempts have been made to capture any SCP-111 instances without Level 4 clearance.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>Research Log 111-A</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Observe the behavior of SCP-111 instances around each other.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Dr. Spencer watched as a group of six SCP-111 instances were released into a large enclosure with a variety of foliage. Dr. Spencer recorded the behavior of the SCP-111 instances in the enclosure for twenty-four hours.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Observations showed that SCP-111 instances interacted almost exclusively with their own species, though they would occasionally make gestures and vocalizations towards other instances when alone.</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/20██</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Observe the behavior of SCP-111 instances when placed together in groups.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Eighteen SCP-111 instances were placed into a large enclosure with multiple creatures of varying types and sizes; they appeared to communicate with each other throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Observations showed that SCP-111 instances communicated with one another by simply standing within arms distance of one another and nodding or grunting in response to verbal questioning, though they did not appear to be actively communicating. It appeared that most interactions between SCP-111 instances involved them touching heads or crotches, and that they would often take turns touching others' bodies in some manner. The majority of SCP-111 instances showed little interest in interacting with any other species, but several instances took turns playing with smaller creatures, including one instance which attempted to play catch with a baby rabbit it had apparently taken as a pet. Further observation showed that SCP-111 instances were capable of feeling pain from different sensations, such as hot or cold temperatures, and could demonstrate this when subjected to physical assault; however, these instances did not appear to react to pain unless it was being inflicted on them directly by another instance of SCP-111.</p>
