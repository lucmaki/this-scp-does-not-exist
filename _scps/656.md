<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-656</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to monitor SCP-656's location and communicate with municipal authorities regarding the removal of SCP-656. SCP-656's removal rate is to be increased to 5 kilograms per month.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-656 is the collective designation for all waste bags belonging to a company in █████, Australia. SCP-656 instances have shown no correlation in production or distribution whatsoever. The nature of SCP-656's anomalous properties manifest after specimens are removed from the bag.</p><p>After being unzipped and unfolded, subjects stored within SCP-656 will exhibit a healthy and normal looking human brain, in a very small space, with their spinal cord extending from their back to their head. Subjects will usually be conscious and able to communicate verbally when permitted access to writing utensils or computers. On occasion, subjects may not be conscious due to increased inflammation of their central nervous system.</p><p>SCP-656 was first discovered after ██████ City Council workers noticed an unusually high number of residents reporting minor neurological symptoms outside local stores and businesses. Attempts were made to remove SCP-656 from nearby stores, only for attempts to fail as more instances emerged within their vicinity. After the loss of ██ Foundation personnel, classified jurisdiction was investigated by Foundation forces and a containment breach was prevented. At this time, the Foundation has taken over investigation and containment of SCP-656. Further details on current containment procedures are available in Document 656-1.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 656-1:</strong> Current Containment Procedures</p><p>Establishing a containment barrier around SCP-656 has proven to be difficult, as the containment barrier grows in strength with each removal of an instance of SCP-656 from the area. As such, the Foundation has established a number of alternative containment procedures.</p><p>SCP-656 instances can be temporarily contained by removing them from the bag, wrapping them in a plastic bag, and placing them in a refrigerated unit. The bags are then sealed with tape and disposed of.</p><p>All items removed from the bags are to be stored in a storage locker located within Site 66's research wing. Containment procedures for these items vary according to size, nature, and value.</p><p>SCP-656 specimens weighing over 5 kilograms worth of material are to be stored in a standard containment cell, equipped with airlocks and cameras."]</p>
