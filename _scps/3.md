<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-3 instances are currently kept in low-security areas, such as Site 0 (Arakawa Ward, Tokyo, Japan), and must be kept under constant surveillance by security personnel. Instances are to be fed a diet of pure carbon with a calcium content of at least 3.4 mg per kg daily for the duration of their containment.</p><p>In the event of an SCP-3 instance being damaged or broken into, it must be repaired as soon as possible and replaced in its original location.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3 is a set of 35 statues situated throughout Japan, dating back to the centuries prior to the Edo period. Each statue is positioned over a suspension bridge in a predominantly residential area, with the exception of two instances (SCP-3-1 and SCP-3-2) that are located in parks. SCP-3 instances vary from 1 to 3 metres tall and weigh between 40 and 130 kg, except for SCP-3-2, which is 33 m tall and weighs 6 kg.</p><p>When an observer looks directly at one of these statues, they will see an image of themselves reflected in its surface as if they were looking into a mirror. This image is only observed when the observer has their back turned to the statue, or when they are looking at another individual with their back turned. Subjects have described this as “stranger staring in your eyes” or “a face looking out of nowhere”. Testing has shown that people from any race or sex can be affected by SCP-3. Note that this effect does not apply to animals or plant life.</p><p>Whenever an observer looks at one of these statues for more than two minutes without moving their head, they will begin to experience hallucinatory visions involving themself and the statue. These visions will appear more vivid the longer they spend watching the statue. These hallucinations appear to be based on the subject seeing themselves through their eyes and will show them performing daily tasks with regards to their job and hobbies, such as gardening or cooking. However, if they make even a single move while viewing these visions, they will cease to exist in this manner. This also seems to affect other people who simply look at an SCP-3 instance; however, no one was able occasionally passing between each other during observations. It has been hypothesized that this effect is related to some kind of anomalous property of carbon nanotubes in SCP-3s bodies due to their similarity with the microscopic tubes found in carbon nanotubes found in SCP-216's body. See Addendum 3 for further details.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 3:</strong> In the year 2000, SCP-3 was discovered to be connected to the deaths of several individuals. The cause of death for all victims involved a hole in the wall of their residence located either directly beneath or behind the statue in question. No traces of these deaths were found until 1999, when the case of ██████ ██████ was investigated in Tokyo, Japan. On █/██/1999, Ms. ██████ was found dead at her residence in Tokyo, Japan after a hole was discovered in the wall behind SCP-3-1. SCP-3-1 was later found to have been broken into by some unknown means; however, no evidence of foul play was found during the investigation.']</p>
