<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-205</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-205 is to be kept in a standard containment storage locker. No experiments involving SCP-205 are to be performed without at least one (1) Level 3 personnel present.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-205 is a plastic sphere, 33 mm in diameter, that appears to be composed of several different types of hard plastics. The interior surface of SCP-205 is lined with a semi-flexible blue rubber membrane. When any object is inserted into SCP-205 and the lid is closed, it will produce a rotating or vibrating effect that appears to originate from the center of SCP-205.</p><p>SCP-205 was recovered during an accidental theft at a juvenile detention center in Mission Viejo, California, after witnesses reported seeing an unidentified man (described as "a large white male") fiddling with an object for some time before placing it under his shirt. A search of the facility revealed SCP-205, along with the man.</p><p>The other objects recovered from the subject were nonanomalous. However, testing shows that this object is capable of causing damage when used improperly by persons other than those inside it. For example, when used on any living organism without prior preparation on its part or suitable protective equipment on their part (such as a body glove), it can cause extreme pain and even irreversible damage. When placed into storage, local fire department officials have reported minor injuries resulting from spontaneous combustion caused by heat buildup inside SCP-205 due to the cloth being stored next to a heater or oven.</p><p>It should be noted that there has not been one single case of spontaneous combustion due to SCP-205 causing any sort of damage. All recorded instances have been triggered by subjects trying to use SCP-205's effects improperly.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
