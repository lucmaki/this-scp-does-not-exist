<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-346</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Internal and external wardens are to be maintained at locations within US, Canadian and Mexican borders to ensure escape of SCP-346-2 instances. Civilian citizens are to be placed under observation following the release of SCP-346-1.</p><p>SCP-346-3 are to be kept in a separate containment cell within Site-19 for research purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-346 is a phenomenon that affects SCP-346-1, a single US dollar bill. SCP-346-1 will continue to gain anomalous properties and deteriorate in appearance over time until it no longer resembles a bill at all. When SCP-346-1 is detached from any form of support, it will become non-anomalous and slowly return to its original condition.</p><p>All materials used to create SCP-346-1 undergo Dimensional Teleportation before being converted into mediums for the transport of instances. These include paper, ink, fibers, and even various forms of metals. The size and composition of the items does not appear to be important. Other than the basic properties described above, no other anomalous traits are displayed by the item received.</p><p>SCP-346 was discovered after a group of anomalous entities attempted to escape containment by transmuting large amounts of money into several instances of SCP-346-2. The effects of the eventual disappearance of these items was correlated to the disappearance of an instance of SCP-346-1.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 346-1:</strong> On 19/09/2018, SCP-346 was declassified as a Euclid object and officially reclassified as a Safe.</p>
