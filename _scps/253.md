<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-253</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All remains of SCP-253 are to be kept in a standard chemical containment locker. Testing is no longer permitted as of ██/██/20██.</p><p>A small harbor has been constructed at the site of SCP-253. The entrance is to be monitored by armed guards and any vessels encountering anomalous objects are to be diverted away from the harbor.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-253 is a vessel of unknown origin, under the control of an unknown entity. SCP-253 is roughly 350m in length, has two passenger decks and a crewed cabin with a capacity of 120. SCP-253 was found on ██/██/2009 near the coast of San Diego.</p><p>SCP-253 does not appear to be reliable for travel. It tends to drift, occasionally achieving orbital velocity. SCP-253 emits a high frequency sound and light that does no lasting damage to its surroundings, but may cause disorientation in humans exposed to it for extended periods.</p><p>SCP-253's primary anomalous effect is that it constantly attempts to escape from the area and return to [REDACTED]. This behavior often causes ships to approach close enough to take photographs or video footage of the vessel. The film taken at these times reveals frequent sightings of humanoid figures aboard and occasionally in the vicinity of SCP-253. These individuals have been tentatively identified as deceased members of the U.S. Armed Forces who were assigned as crew or passengers during WWII. Analysis indicates that they are extremely hostile to any intrusion into the area they had been assigned to protect and will attempt to attack intruders using whatever weapons they had been equipped with at their time of death.</p><p>One recording revealed an additional anomalous effect: after 10 minutes without further interference, SCP-253 entered a state similar to hibernation (see Addendum 253). While effectively invisible, its interior temperature began dropping steadily until it was roughly 32 degrees Celsius above ambient temperature for approximately 6 months. During this period, all non personnel were affected by hallucinations consistent with those induced by hypothermia; however these hallucinations were not severe enough to prevent sleep and most individuals felt little distress over them (see Incident 253-P). Following this period, the interior temperature rose rapidly and reached ambient temperatures within 1 hour of being outside once again (see Addendum 253). The crew were awoken by a loud bang and awoke with mild euphoria that lasted approximately 40 minutes before declining in intensity. No physical injuries have been reported following either incident.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 253-P:</strong> Throughout the lifetime of SCP-253, its interior temperature has been known to change from 32\xa0°C to a range between 15 and 100\xa0°C. This effect is not related to any changes in atmospheric pressure and is not known to have any correlation with the incidents described in the above document.']</p>
