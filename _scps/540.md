<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-540</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-540 instances are to be stored in standard containment locker 2865 at Site-██ for standard testing. Standard lighting, temperature and humidity settings are to be maintained inside these lockers.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-540 are human males between the ages of fifty and seventy, with extremely prominent facial features. These include a higher than normal forehead, prominent eyebrows, high cheekbones and thin lips. Facial pigmentation is exactly the same as an average human male. The skin of SCP-540 instances has shown no unusual texture or structure regardless of age or trauma sustained.</p><p>SCP-540 do not appear to have any physical reaction to the presence of other creatures such as humans or animals, although they appear to show more acute reactions towards hostile humans (fellow gangsters). Any type of human interaction will cause SCP-540 to react violently towards the aggressor.</p><p>SCP-540 are given their apparent designation due to their occupation: "gangster", "mobster" and similar terms. All SCP-540 instances have a different occupation and often use different names; however all prove to be very dedicated members of their individual crews. It is not currently known what job duties are carried out by these men. It is believed that location has a great impact on specific crew work as it appears that only certain crews operate in specific locations with little deviation between crews in other areas.</p><p>Instances of SCP-540 seem to vary in levels of aggression, with some appearing more active then others. However, most manifestations are still homicidal in nature, even if they are directed towards fellow gangsters rather then the enemy.</p><p>It is currently believed that at least three main gangs exist, each with different variations on the name but otherwise simple occupations: "The Bully", "21st Century Executioners" and "Kings of Crime".</p><p>Variations of SCP-540 behavior can completely change from day to day depending on certain situations. For instance, if there is a threat nearby such as a police officer or soldier then all instances will become completely docile and passive, attempting to surrender themselves for transportation out of the area without any resistance or violence. This response does not appear until after all personnel attempting to restrain them have been neutralized and they will give up no information regarding where they were taken or who their primary employers are unless specifically asked by one of their employers before they agree to cooperate.</p><p>There is also no evidence that these instances create any weapons or ammunition on their own.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 540-1:</strong> The following footage was captured by security cameras at a local bar on ██-██-████, shortly before the establishment was destroyed by fire.</p><p><BEGIN LOG></p><p>[Security footage of bar shows normal activity until a group of SCP-540 enter and sit at a table in the back. The group consists of three men, all sitting at the table. All instances appear to be of a similar age and height with the exception of one man who is sitting at the head of the table.]</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> I hope we got our money\'s worth.</p><p>[The man sitting at the head of the table stands up, walks over to the bar and grabs a bottle of beer from a shelf. He then walks back to his seat. The rest of the group appears to not notice or acknowledge him as he sits down.]</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> Alright let\'s see what we\'re dealing with here… [The man leans forward in his seat, bringing his mouth close to the microphone] One, two, three…</p><p>[Everyone in the room turns towards where the man is pointing and look in that direction.]</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> Yours truly, Quentin! Quentin Cunningham!</p><p>[Several other men are shown sitting at tables around the bar. All instances appear to be wearing the same outfits as Quentin; black leather jackets with various patches on them, blue jeans and white T-shirts. All instances appear to be armed with shivs, firearms and clubs.]</p><p><strong>Man:</strong> Now then… what would you like? [The man pulls out a small notepad and pencil from his pocket and begins writing.] Name? Occupation? Last known location?</p><p>[One instance stands up from their seat and walks over to where Quentin is standing.]</p><p><strong>Instance:</strong> How about me? What the hell am I doing here? [The instance removes their sunglasses and looks at Quentin.]</p><p><strong>Quentin:</strong> You? You\'re one of my boys! William "Will" Cunningham! You\'re just what I needed! [Quentin motions for Will to take a seat beside him. Will does so grudgingly.]</p><p>[The other members of Quentin\'s crew sit down again as Will remains standing behind him.]</p><p><strong>Quentin:</strong> So now that we have that out of the way, let me ask you something: what exactly do we do here?</p><p>[Will looks at Quentin for a moment before looking around the room again. Another member stands up and moves towards Quentin.]</p><p><strong>Member:</strong> That\'s easy, boss. We\'re here to protect your ass! Can\'t have you getting any heat on you now can we?</p><p>[Will looks more agitated but remains silent as he sits down again.]</p><p><strong>Quentin:</strong> Don\'t get irate! I\'m trying to get some answers here. I need to know how you guys work. For example… how many of you were there when I started this mess in ██████ all those years ago?</p><p>[Several SCP-540 stand up again.]</p><p><strong>Instances:</strong> About thirty or so! At least that\'s what I heard… [Several instances return to their seat once their names have been called out by Quentin.] And someone who called himself "Mr. Big" came down himself! [Various other instances stand up again.] We had about thirty point four then. And Mr. Big gave us everything we wanted in exchange for our loyalty! [Several other instances stand up again.] We had everything locked down like clockwork after that! And that\'s how it went for about thirty years until… well you know how it turned out. What happened then? What did Mr. Big want in exchange for all that money? [Several members seem to be pondering their answer as they remain seated.] Decisions had to be made right? Decisions had to be made by someone with more clout than us little fellas! And so suddenly Mr. Big disappeared without explanation… without taking those few bags of money we all knew were coming in that day! And it was too late by then… everyone got burned except us! We survived! [Many instances stand up once more.] But everyone else didn\'t survive like we did! [Several instances turn away from Quentin and look towards the door instead.] How many times do we have to go through this!? Why do we even exist!? We\'re nothing but a bunch of fucking criminals… why should we even exist!? Why can\'t I just die right now!? Why?!?! Why?!?! [Several instances stand up once more.] How much more can we take!? We\'ve been through worse than this already! Isn\'t it enough!? [Several instances stand up again once more.} What are we gaining by doing this!? Why?!?! Why!? Why?!?!']</p>
