<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-854</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to establish a cover story in the community of ██████ and any other similar communities found to have SCP-854. A public nuisance investigation team is to monitor the waters at the scene of any SCP-854 recoveries and take appropriate action.</p><p>SCP-854-1 are to be contained via biohazardous disposal. SCP-854-2 are to be contained via biohazardous disposal. SCP-854-3 are to be contained using an advanced submersible craft capable of ship-to-ship transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-854 is a species of toad endemic to the North American Atlantic Coastal Plain, commonly known as the Chorus Frog. SCP-854, or "Chorus Frogs" in the common parlance, are extremely prolific amphibians, having been observed living on and above the water's surface for extended periods of time.</p><p>These amphibians are capable of vocal mimicry, with specimens displaying vocal capabilities ranging from sound effects such as a door squeak, to simple voicings of human speech. SCP-854 has also shown to be capable of mimicking the sounds made by smaller organisms such as fish, osprey, bumblebees and other land animals; however, their auditory centers are not believed to be capable of picking up faint sounds such as those produced by these creatures. It is theorized that SCP-854's ability to mimic noises is developed through regular interaction with amphibians and similar animals that live on or near water.</p><p>SCP-854 are generally found in large groups during low tide, primarily inhabiting the shallow waters surrounding aquatic tees and ponds. They will approach any large structure (water reservoir, house boat or vessel) and make loud chirps that resemble a gurgling brook. When within one (1) meter from a container of water in which they can climb onto their back legs and lower themselves into, most will cling to it with their claws until nightfall. The next morning they will crawl out into the water where they feed on largely aquatic invertebrates such as worms, snails and small fish. These creatures have shown an affinity for regenerating flesh wounds via unknown means; it is suspected that this is carried out by the prey items being lifted out of the mud by friction between the ground and several appendages located at the end of their limbs.</p><p>SCP-854 Mimes appear docile when first sighted, but have been observed to have developed rare violent tendencies when provoked. However, due to their large size relative to their environment they typically only resort to violence after sources of food have dwindled or when approached by humans attempting to capture them for research purposes.</p><p>Recovery: A containment breach occurred at Site ██ after several cross-contamination incidents occurred within various containment facilities involving SCP-854 organisms being transferred from area A (lab) containment facility onto B (emergency holding area) containment facility. Undercover agents present noted signs indicating this was not an accidental occurrence but rather two instances of SCP-854 usage outside B site's containment procedures; this evidence included discarded food wrappers at the scene and a report from Area A security personnel stating that specimens were being recovered from a nearby pond following a breach of protocol 72B25T27 ("Hazardous Materials Storage"). All D-Class personnel present were administered Class C amnestics after Foundation personnel recovered all SCP-854 specimens present at B site's Containment Area 6 ("Air Bubble") facility.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> During the containment of SCP-854-2, it was found that their vocalizations, when compared to their normal chirps, contained a distinct humming sound. After several experiments, it was determined that all instances of SCP-854-2 were capable of producing this sound at will.</p><p><strong>Document 854A:</strong> Antecedents of SCP-854's Behavior</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Subject 001:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 002:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 003:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 004:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 005:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 006:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 007:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 008:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 009:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 010:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 011:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 012:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 013:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 014:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 015:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 016:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 017:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 018:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 019:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 020:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 021:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 022:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 023:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854.</p><p><strong>Subject 024:</strong> A standard specimen of SCP-854."]</p>
