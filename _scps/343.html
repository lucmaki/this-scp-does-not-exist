<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-343</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-342 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell located in Site-21's Containment Wing. All interactions with SCP-342 are to take place via video feed, and all personnel interacting with SCP-342 are to wear ear protection during interaction sessions.</p><p>Any personnel attempting to escape the containment facility are to be terminated immediately by security forces and their bodies are to be consumed by SCP-342. If a D-Class is to undergo this procedure, two guards must be present for each D-Class showing symptoms of disorientation due to the consumption of an additional human body.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-342 is a humanoid entity possessing primarily avian traits. It possesses a torso, two arms, and two wings, each of which terminates in three digits. SCP-342's skin appears to be vitrified due to its appearance and shape, as well as its resistance to most forms of damage. SCP-342 is capable of moving and behaving as an ambulatory human, though it has demonstrated some difficulty in performing basic tasks requiring opposable thumbs.</p><p>SCP-342's skin also has some degree of elasticity, allowing it to stretch, bend, twist and ball into a thin membrane layer (see attached photo). This membrane is located underneath the outer layer of SCP-342's body following the removal of the fleshy layer. SCP-342 will become more resistant to damage if the membrane is present, though it can still be broken in sufficient force or by high temperatures (such as being placed inside a furnace or dropped into boiling water).</p><p>The membrane also appears to act as an additional protective layer in addition to its elasticity; fire cannot penetrate the membrane without significant force while sterilization chemicals have little effect on the membrane. Heat resistance is not limited to its own body; if another object is heated through contact with SCP-342's membrane then this heat can pass through and affect any object it comes in contact with up to a distance of 3 meters.</p><p>SCP-342 was recovered during an operation conducted by MTF Lambda-10 ("Birdwatchers") on 12/12/2004 after reports surfaced that several birds had been seen flying towards a nuclear power plant located at ████████████, Nebraska and attacking humans inside surrounding areas. Before arriving on site, Lambda-10 personnel observed several similar instances of SCP-342 near a nuclear power station in ████████, Arkansas.</p><p>Following an initial investigation which included interviewing witnesses who had witnessed SCP-342's flight patterns before their disappearance, Lambda-10 discovered that it was attracted to large crowds of people within a 5 km radius of nuclear reactors and attacked those involved in any way with the movement of these facilities from the east coast side of the United States (see Incident Report 342-01).</p><p>Additional information concerning its attacks can be found under File 342-███.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
