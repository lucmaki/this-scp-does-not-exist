<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-116</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-116 is to be kept in a standard Safe Containment Locker, in the storage wing of Site-77. It may not be removed from its locker except by approved personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher. Any changes made to SCP-116 must have an approved change log. The current change log is available at the Site library computer terminals and may be printed if needed. The use of outside electronic devices by personnel without Level 4 clearance or higher is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-116 is a laptop computer, of the type commonly used in academic institutions. It has been modified to run an operating system native to an operating system found on various Keter class objects. The operating system is a heavily customized version of █████ ████ ████████ █████, proprietary software sold to government organizations for surveillance applications.</p><p>SCP-116 operates as normal until it is accessed by a non-approved user. In such cases, the user will be given a prompt asking them to create a program or application that confers a benefit upon eligible individuals. Upon choosing either "Yes" or "No", the user will receive 5 points. The points are then stored for later use by the user, and all of the user's access requests have the same outcome.</p><p>Once these points have been accumulated, they may be spent at the suggestion of SCP-116 to make a number of changes to eligible human subjects' biology and/or behavior. These changes are permanent and do not revert back to their original state over time. Subjects' behavior may range from minor social adjustments to major psychological trauma or even death. As SCP-116 is not capable of analyzing humans visually (it relies on voice recognition and facial mappings based on images displayed on its display), SCP-116 requires analysis by personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher in order to determine what effects will occur before the subject is selected.</p><p>As there are no concrete laws governing human modification in most countries and many would consider human modification immoral or repugnant, all changes made by SCP-116 gain the designation [DATA EXPUNGED]. Those affected by changes caused by SCP-116 become ineligible for legal marriage contracts under most jurisdictions when they are adults; however, if they wish to contract legally, Humanoid Status [DATA EXPUNGED] may be applied instead of an invalid marriage contract. This does not seem to affect other relationships outside marriage.</p><p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 116-1:</strong> The following is a log of changes made to humans by SCP-116. Each change was made in the order listed, and only after all of the previous changes had been made.']</p>
