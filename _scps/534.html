<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Inside SCP-534, access is only to be granted via several sets of tunnels. Security personnel are to be stationed outside of the entrances, and entry into the site is strictly forbidden. In the event that any unauthorized entities enter the site, a large crowd is to be herded in front of the entrance, thereby obstructing all exits. All personnel entering SCP-534 must be armed with tasers, and any attempt to escape or steal from SCP-534 must be met with lethal force.</p><p>As of 09/06/2018, SCP-534 has been declared an extant urban legend by local authorities. Residents are advised to report any unusual activity to local police authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-534 is an abandoned military facility located in the Guía Ventós region of [REDACTED], Spain.</p><p>The main building appears to have been built during the Spanish Civil War and was abandoned after World War One, remaining mostly intact until the 1970s. The facility consisted of four structures:</p><p>A loud, thumping was heard emanating from SCP-534 for the first time on 09/06/2018 at approximately 04:30 AM local time. All recordings preceding this date have been recovered and are listed below.</p><p>Recording 1: Low, rumbling sound heard through ground, possibly due to flooding as of 09/06/2018 at 04:10 AM local time.</p><p>Recording 2: Loud, rumbling sound heard through ground, possibly due to flooding as of 09/06/2018 at 04:30 AM local time.</p><p>Recording 3: Loud, rumbling sound heard through ground, possibly due to flooding as of 09/06/2018 at 04:40 AM local time.</p><p>Recording 4: Loud, rumbling sound heard through ground, possibly due to flooding as of 09/06/2018 at 04:50 AM local time.</p><p>Noises are still audible from outside the structure on subsequent recordings. Foundation personnel have attempted to enter SCP-534 and document the cause for its activity. Foundation contractors have logged a variety of anomalous phenomena related to SCP-534 over the last 100 years; if you find any more descriptions or recordings that don't fit into our database please let us know!</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Due to its secretive nature, the construction of SCP-534 has been difficult to trace. Information regarding its location is sparse, and it is believed that there are no known photographs of the facility. We have compiled the following list of known locations in order to attempt to recreate the layout of SCP-534.</p><p><strong>Construction:</strong> Construction was performed by the Spanish military between 1910 and 1917. The structure was abandoned after the failure of the Spanish Civil War.</p><p><strong>Construction Materials:</strong> Salvaged materials from a variety of local depots, including cast iron, concrete, metal and wooden beams.</p><p><strong>Foundation Connection:</strong> Foundation personnel discovered SCP-534 in 1973, and classified it as an extant urban legend.</p><p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong></p><p>Foundation intelligence reports indicate that SCP-534 was first documented in 1973 by Dr. Alberto Ruiz-Irastorza while investigating rumors of a mysterious bunker located in [REDACTED]. Ruiz-Irastorza reported hearing heavy footsteps inside of SCP-534 when attempting to investigate the source of the thumping he had heard. The source of these footsteps was not documented.</p>
