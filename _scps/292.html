<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-292</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-292 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. The key may only be removed or opened by personnel assigned to this task. In the event that SCP-292's containment container is breached, it is to be sealed and the object destroyed.</p><p>A pair of security cameras have been installed to monitor SCP-292's area of confinement. Any personnel attempting to remove the object are to be monitored via the security cameras in order to track their movements and report any suspicious activity. Any information regarding attempts to circumvent protocol or gain access to SCP-292 are to be considered a high priority security breach, and all pertinent information recorded (see File 291-1).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-292 is a standard black leather wallet, measuring approximately 5 cm x 8 cm in size. It contains four compartments, each containing a card of some kind. The object's outer appearance has not changed since the time of its initial discovery, and the cards continue to display their original design and branding.</p><p>Three out of the four interior card slots contain recognizable cards, but are inscribed with the words "Assembled" or "Disassembled", both in English and Russian (the language used on SCP-292). These are designated 293, 294 and 295 respectively. The fourth compartment is empty, with no card corresponding to it.</p><p>When presented with a card inserted into any of the other three slots, SCP-292 will open up to include a miniature photograph of one of the person(s) listed on that card. The photographs change constantly, depending on individuals SCP-292 previously contained, with some photographs being extremely distorted by molds and/or damage. These photographs usually show several individuals standing in various locations (i.e., in an office building or confined to an elevator), and some of these photographs are covered by plaster from damaged ceilings. Other photographs depict individuals in groups at outdoor locations (e.g., attending outdoor events or hiking), and others show individuals involved in various activities related to professions for which no persons have been identified (e.g., construction crews or reception staff). When asked, SCP-292 will claim that there are no names listed on any of its cards.</p><p>In addition to the storage capacity provided by its compartments, SCP-292 has a slot at its center which can store another item, such as a key or credit card. This can be used to expand its storage capacity, but also allows access to further anomalous properties when used in this fashion.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-292 has been found in ██████, Russia, after local authorities discovered a vacant apartment with a large amount of blood. The living room had been ransacked, and the body of an elderly man was discovered in one of the rooms. The deceased individual was identified as █████ ████████, a Ukrainian immigrant who had lived in the apartment for two years. The apartment\'s residents were reported to be Mr. ████████\'s son, his daughter, and her husband. Mr. ████████ had been missing since the previous day and was found dead at approximately 4:00PM. It is unknown how he came to be in the apartment in the first place (the murder weapon [DATA EXPUNGED] was not recovered). The body showed signs of extreme malnutrition, likely caused by Mr. ████████\'s son abandoning him.</p><p>Three cards were found on Mr. ████████\'s body; these are designated 292-1 through 292-3. The cards have been scanned and placed in this file as 291-1 through 291-3 respectively.</p><p>The "Assembled" card from SCP-292 was found in Mr. ████████\'s pocket, and was clean of any blood stains or damage. When removed from the object, it appeared to have been completely assembled, but upon closer inspection, it appeared to have been broken twice (both times in the same place). When returned to SCP-292, it blinked twice before changing into a photograph of its current state. The photograph it showed was that of Mr. ████████ standing outside his apartment building.</p><p>The "Disassembled" card from SCP-292 was found in Mr. ████████\'s pocket, with a thick layer of plaster covering the photograph. Upon removing the plaster, the image could be seen underneath. The photograph showed several individuals working on a structure resembling an elevator shaft. None of these individuals were known to have worked for Mr. ████████ or his family, and no further information about them could be determined.</p>
