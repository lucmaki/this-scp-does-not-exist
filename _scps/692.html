<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-692</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-692 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. The item is, "at all times," to be kept within a 5 cm radius of SCP-692's enclosing frame and mechanism. At all times, SCP-692 is to be kept within a 20 cm radius of the frame or frame-like external device; if the item were to leave current containment units, the staff responsible for its containment and care are required to obliterate it from any terrestrial surface that it may impact on.</p><p>Any material used in the construction of any place or thing that SCP-692 has been found on is to be alarmed at Level 1 priority and closely surveilled to prevent any of these items from being tampered with. Any changes made to these materials must be reported immediately to staff in charge of SCP-692.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-692 is a circular metallic device covered in rust and tar, measuring 1.25 cm in diameter. Despite being near identical to a cardiac pacemaker, SCP-692 does not have any circuitry or system running or functioning that could be connected to the heart, and it fails all electrical tests conducted on it. SCP-692 shows no anomalous behavior when removed from the person that it was placed into by an unknown party (The fact that these people did not notice that they were implanted with an anomalous device is still under investigation).</p><p>SCP-692 has shown extremely erratic behavior, primarily involving its designation as a component within a facility known as "Infinite Upgrade". Attempts to secure concrete information regarding the events and location of this facility are ongoing.</p><p>In the past thirty days, tests conducted on SCP-692 have shown that the object has several capabilities contrary to what would normally be expected of such a device. These include:</p><p>History: SCP-692 was found in ████, Mexico, in a cemetery adjacent to what used to be the city's central train station. The excavated portion of the object was six meters away from the Foundation's immediate sightline; however, MTF Tau-13 ("Monkeys with Guns") was able to successfully recover multiple pieces of the item from their site of excavation without incident.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On 05/██/██, an anomaly was caused in the building that housed SCP-692's containment unit. The Foundation staff assigned to SCP-692 (Dr. ██████, Dr. ██████, and two research assistants) were unable to take precautions against the object's anomalous abilities, resulting in a large portion of the containment unit being destroyed and causing the death of all personnel.</p><p>It is theorized that this event was caused by SCP-692 attempting to expand its radius of effect, preventing it from being contained or isolated from other SCP objects; however, no further information on this theory has yet been forthcoming."]</p>
