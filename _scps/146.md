<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-146</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-146 is to be kept in a 20 x 20 m chamber which has been constructed in a manner allowing for full interaction with the structure. SCP-146 is to be supplied with a constant supply of food (500 grams per day), water (500 ml per day) and oxygen.</p><p>Remotely controlled environmental barriers are to isolate SCP-146 from any outside ambient radiation at all times, including gamma rays, cosmic rays and intense ultraviolet radiation. This protection is to be provided by 10 cm of lead shielding. All personnel entering the containment chamber are to wear lead vests, aprons or other appropriate shielding.</p><p>In case of accidental leakage of SCP-146-2, no personnel may enter its effects radius until 24 hours after exposure has elapsed. A 25 cm thick lead wall is also required to contain the effects of SCP-146-1.</p><p>The entrance to SCP-146's containment chamber is to be permanently closed, and all personnel assisting with maintenance or removal of any objects from SCP-146's area of effect are to undergo psychiatric evaluation and have their clearance revoked until such time as this exposure (if any) has occurred. In the event that SCP-146's primary effect should expand beyond its original containment chamber, due to an outside source, it is to be contained at Site ██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-146 is a circular room, 20 meters in diameter and 3 meters tall. The interior is composed of a highly reflective white metallic shell, with a smooth texture not unlike that of glass. Inside the spherical surface of SCP-146 are hundreds of small black spheres, with a diameter of 1 centimeter. These objects cannot be removed from SCP-146 without breaking the surface.</p><p>When left undisturbed for long enough, these "space balls" will slowly manifest themselves within SCP-146's interior as an array of intersecting lines arranged in a hexagonal formation. These "lines" appear to represent an intricate 3D pattern similar to Braille or Morse Code. This pattern will continue to grow in complexity at its own pace, generating new points as needed, until line segments begin to overlap one another on the interior surface. It is unknown whether these patterns can generate new patterns when no lines are present or if there is any limit on its complexity.</p><p>In addition this pattern also extends into areas outside the containment chamber itself, apparently projected through the walls, floor and ceiling of the containment chamber. If this pattern expands outside of SCP-146, it will also begin growing inside whatever area it occupies. A few examples are given below:</p><p>This growth appears to be independent of time as designated by Foundation clocks. For example, despite being contained for 180 days with no outside influence, CCTV footage shows that the pattern has continued growing along with it at its own rate.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 146-2:</strong> SCP-146 was discovered in [DATA EXPUNGED]. It was placed into immediate Foundation custody after reports of ██ deaths due to contact with SCP-146. After inspection, it was determined that the object was in a state of containment failure, due to the presence of SCP-146-1 within the room.</p><p>SCP-146-1 is a small black sphere attached to the wall of SCP-146's containment chamber. When left in its original location, SCP-146-1 has no effect on its surroundings. However, if it is moved more than 12\xa0cm away from the wall of SCP-146, SCP-146-1 will begin to rapidly expand until it completely envelops its new location. The process has been observed to take between 2 and 10 minutes, depending on the distance from which it is moved.</p><p>SCP-146-1 also appears to possess an effect on anyone who enters its area of effect, causing them to experience severe nausea, headaches and disorientation similar to that caused by radiation exposure, regardless of whether they have been exposed to such things before or not. Their condition becomes increasingly severe over time and seems to be permanent unless treated with an appropriate drug or other substance capable of neutralizing this effect.</p><p>If this effect is not neutralized, the subject will begin experiencing symptoms consistent with [DATA EXPUNGED]."]</p>
