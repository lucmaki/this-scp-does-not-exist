<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-218</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Anomalous</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-218 is kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Food and water are to be dispensed through a small hatch in the wall, which is to remain closed at all times. Should SCP-218 manifest any symptoms of distress, personnel are required to remove their shoes before approaching.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-218 is a Caucasian female humanoid.</p><p>SCP-218's sole extremity is non-anomalous, with the exception of possessing five toes. SCP-218 is otherwise completely human in all other respects.</p><p>When more than one person is present within SCP-218's room, SCP-218 will manifest anomalous effects. In the presence of two people, SCP-218 will produce a pair of raised hardened pads on its feet, which exhibit all qualities of leather shoes and will remain deployed until retracted.</p><p>SCP-218 seems to enjoy running and various athletic activities, and will not hesitate to show this off in front of staff.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>Incident 218-B</p><p>SCP-218 was discovered in a warehouse after reports of a missing person. The owner of the building was found dead and SCP-218 was missing, with the owner's body being found in the room.</p><p>A search of the room revealed no evidence of SCP-218 having been present prior to its disappearance. Following an interview with SCP-218, it became clear that SCP-218 had been following the owner into the room and had taken control of her body.</p><p>It is believed that SCP-218 could only take control of bodies who were wearing footwear at the time.</p><p>After further questioning, SCP-218 admitted to having entered the room via a large hole in the wall, which it claimed to have made with its bare feet.</p>
