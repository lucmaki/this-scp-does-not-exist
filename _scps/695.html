<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-695</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-695 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-06. The area surrounding the cell is to be floodlit at all times. Reports of SCP-695's inexplicable disappearance should be dismissed as instances of SCP-012.</p><p>A medical kit is to be kept in the cell and replaced after use by Foundation personnel. All personnel are not to enter the cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-695 appears to be a male with a body mass at or below human standards. SCP-695 is ambulatory, despite its size and strength. It appears to have no biological need for food or sleep, as it recovers from such sensations immediately.</p><p>SCP-695 moves in an erratic manner that has been observed to elicit laughter in witnesses. Beings within hearing range of SCP-695 are compelled to move towards it; moving away causes them to fall or otherwise become immobile. This effect is primarily verified by SCP-012 effects, and does not appear to be perceived by SCP-695 itself.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-695 was found in an abandoned warehouse in ███████, ██. A large section of the roof had fallen inwards, and was found to contain a small humanoid entity, which had been described as "a big spider".</p><p>A Foundation team was sent in to contain the entity and found it to be completely pacified, no longer moving towards them. The entity was transferred to Site-06 for further study before being released into the general public.</p><p>The entity has since evolved into a human male with anomalous properties. It is scheduled for release in the near future.</p>
