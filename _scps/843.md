<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-843</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All human samples of SCP-843 are kept in a standard containment unit at Site-77. The object is to be kept within the same room as a recreational area, with first aid kits and newspapers for cover. SCP-843 may be moved about Foundation sites for testing purposes only; when the object is brought to other locations, an armed escort will follow it at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-843 is a single room, measuring 17 square meters in size. The room contains a bed, a chair, two small tables, two barbeque grills, and one refrigerator. Access to the room is controlled by a normal lock, with no additional locking mechanisms observed when SCP-843 is powered down.</p><p>When activated at least once per week, SCP-843 will produce an item of food which possesses increased nutritional value. The object's nutritional value seems to increase in proportion to SCP-843's activation level; for example, a meal prepared by SCP-843 after six monthly activations will have 80% more nutritional value than a similar meal made by the object prior to its containment.</p><p>When sampled before cutlery or in any other way with food prep equipment such as knives or cutting boards present, the object seems to accelerate the loss of nutrition; for instance, subjecting SCP-843 to this process results in 20% less nutritional value than would be obtained from the same meal made without machinery involved.</p><p>SCP-843 was first discovered while investigating reports of a man who disappeared while traveling through New England; when interviewed, he claimed that he had been approached by SCP-843 while on foot and questioned him about his dietary habits. When questioned further, it was discovered that the man had been missing for several days; when found earlier than expected due to weather conditions delaying search teams, the man showed signs of hypothermia and malnutrition. After speaking with other subjects affected by the object who were also located in rural areas close to mountains and oceans and cases of similar origin began popping up around North America and South America in general; these cases being caused by similar objects reaching their destination before Foundation agents could intercept them.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 843-1:</strong> Investigation into the object's anomalous properties have resulted in Foundation agents acquiring SCP-843. The following are the items acquired through SCP-843's anomalous properties and their acquired retrieval dates."]</p>
