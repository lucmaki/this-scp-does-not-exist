<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-341</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-341 is to be kept in a liquid nitrogen tank measuring 20 m by 5 m with a mass of 10 kg under the supervision of two Level 2 test subjects. The tank is to be kept at a temperature of -200 °C. Any signs of cracking or damage to the tank are to prompt immediate personnel to activate tank-entry cooling system. Testing of SCP-341 requires approval from Dr. ██████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-341 is a small white square suspended in a glob of liquid nitrogen on a thin metal wire. SCP-341 appears to move at approximately 20 km/s in the present state and has not been observed to undergo any change in behavior since its discovery. SCP-341 is 1.9 m wide and 0.2 m tall with a mass of 1.7 g.</p><p>When observed through a standard optical microscope, SCP-341 appears to be empty. DNA analysis has shown no genetic material or other biological components. Another test involving the microscopic analysis of [REDACTED] samples provided by Dr. ██████ produced similar results; samples display no biological activity nor any chemical components found in normal cellular structures. The interior of SCP-341 appears to be perfectly spherical without any visible seams or other features not found in normal space travel systems such as warp drive and hyperspace drives. The nature of how SCP-341 operates is unknown to the Foundation and outside scientific researchers alike as contact with SCP-341 causes instantaneous death from lack of oxygen within several seconds of entry by any non-test personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
