<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-341</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-341 is to be kept in a liquid nitrogen tank measuring 20 m by 5 m with a mass of 10 kg under the supervision of two Level 2 test subjects. The tank is to be kept at a temperature of -200 °C. Any signs of cracking or damage to the tank are to prompt immediate personnel to activate tank-entry cooling system. Testing of SCP-341 requires approval from Dr. ██████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-341 is a small white square suspended in a glob of liquid nitrogen on a thin metal wire. SCP-341 appears to move at approximately 20 km/s in the present state and has not been observed to undergo any change in behavior since its discovery. SCP-341 is 1.9 m wide and 0.2 m tall with a mass of 1.7 g.</p><p>When observed through a standard optical microscope, SCP-341 appears to be empty. DNA analysis has shown no genetic material or other biological components. Another test involving the microscopic analysis of [REDACTED] samples provided by Dr. ██████ produced similar results; samples display no biological activity nor any chemical components found in normal cellular structures. The interior of SCP-341 appears to be perfectly spherical without any visible seams or other features not found in normal space travel systems such as warp drive and hyperspace drives. The nature of how SCP-341 operates is unknown to the Foundation and outside scientific researchers alike as contact with SCP-341 causes instantaneous death from lack of oxygen within several seconds of entry by any non-test personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 341-1:</strong> SCP-341 was discovered on March 13, 20██ on the ████ ███████ satellite in space. A Foundation probe was sent to investigate and discovered the object. SCP-341 was able to prevent further probes from entering the object and two test subjects were sent to enter SCP-341 in order to extract any possible information. Upon entry into SCP-341, both test subjects suffocated within seconds without any visible signs of damage to their bodies.']</p>
