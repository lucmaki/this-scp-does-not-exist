<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-962</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-962 is to be contained within a steel tank of 200 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height. The interior of the tank is lined with lead and concrete, and the tank is to be filled with water. A lid to the top of the tank is to be kept on at all times; attempts to remove this lid will result in immediate termination.</p><p>SCP-962 is to be fed a diet consisting of fish, crustaceans, and small mammals; the exact composition of this diet is at the discretion of Dr. ████████.</p><p>The exterior of SCP-962's containment tank should consist of a 10 cm thick layer of lead; any breach above this thickness will result in immediate termination. In case of emergency, personnel that breach more than 1 cm of the lead casing are to be terminated immediately and replaced. Any attempt by researchers to interact with SCP-962 should be restricted only to approved testing procedures, unless given explicit approval from O Command.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-962 is a large, squid-like creature measuring approximately 1.5 meters in length and weighing an estimated 200 kilograms. The body of SCP-962 appears to be made of a material similar to steel, and has no discernible organs or bones. The head of SCP-962 bears two large black eyes with a circumference of roughly half that of the entire body. The mouth of SCP-962 is located at the base of the body, near a small ocular organ; this mouth is capable of producing a purple substance that may be used for communication purposes.</p><p>SCP-962 possesses the ability to alter its size at will and can assume any form from that of a squid to that of a human. SCP-962's actual size is dependent on the form it takes; when in human form, SCP-962 appears to be 2 cm tall and weighs 3 kg. In squid form, SCP-962 is roughly 10 cm long and weighs approximately 30 kg.</p><p>The current state of SCP-962's brain is unknown; however, it appears to have several functions similar to those possessed by other organisms. For example, it can see, hear, taste, and feel pain like normal humans. It also possesses basic emotions such as fear and anger; however, these are not dependent on stimuli like they are in normal humans.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Incident Report</p><p>An incident involving SCP-962 occurred on ██/██/████. During this period, SCP-962 was observed to have grown to a height of 10\xa0cm and weigh approximately 75\xa0kg. The anomaly was contained, and no casualties were reported. However, SCP-962 became agitated and began emitting waves of purple light from its mouth; the waves were initially small, but quickly grew in size until all personnel were affected. The body of SCP-962 exploded violently as a result of the wave. A number of pieces of brain matter resembling that of SCP-962's body were recovered from the body of a researcher who was apparently killed by the wave; it is unknown whether these fragments are actually composed of SCP-962's body.*</p><p>SCP-962 has increased in activity since this incident. On ██/██/████, SCP-962 suddenly appeared before Researcher ███████ in the containment tank; Researcher ███████ was unable to move after this event and died shortly afterward. The researchers involved in these incidents theorize that there must be some sort of connection between the events involving Researcher ███████ and the other occurrences involving SCP-962.", 'Addendum: Testing Approval Request</p><p>I, Dr. █████, request permission to test the effect of SCP-962 on other organisms. I believe this will prove beneficial in further understanding of the anomaly and its effects on human minds. -Dr. ███████']</p>
