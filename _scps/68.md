<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-68</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-68 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment unit, with any and all common objects removed from it. Testing for objects of anomalous properties is allowed with the prior approval of at least one Level 2 Curator.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-68 is a middle-aged Caucasian female, standing 1.62m and weighing 64 kg. It has a brownish hue to its skin, and wears a black top and pants. The number 6 appears on both the front and back of its shirt. SCP-68 is not visibly hostile or aggressive, but shows signs of childlike curiosity at all times.</p><p>When something with an unknown type of anomalous effect is placed in close proximity to SCP-68, any objects that are subsequently placed within the range of SCP-68 will have their properties altered to match those of a common plastic box; this effect extends to all similar objects in the area at the time of the test (up to the point where they are beyond SCP-68's sensory range).</p><p>SCP-68 prefers non-anomalous foods such as candy, fatty foods, and soda. Testing on SCP-68's anomalous properties with non-anomalous objects has revealed no changes in its properties. It will also react negatively if it is given a meal which it considers 'weird'.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 68-1:</strong> SCP-68 was discovered inside a mall in ████, ██████. The object of anomalous properties was discovered in the basement of a ████████████ store, and is assumed to have been placed there by the store's previous owners."]</p>
