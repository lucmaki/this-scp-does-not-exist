<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-73</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation no longer monitors SCP-73, and the site appears to be occupied by a local high school in ██████, █████. SCP-73 is not to be interacted with by personnel lacking proper clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-73 is a large, one story house with a blue roof and yellow trim located in ██████, █████. SCP-73 was built in 1965. The front door is secured and barred with two deadbolts, but it can be opened from the inside. SCP-73 contains various levels of utility rooms and bedrooms, a kitchen and dining room, and two bathrooms.</p><p>SCP-73 exhibits a seemingly anomalous property: Any human being who enters the structure and spends at least 12 hours within it will gain properties corresponding to their age. This effect seems to work regardless of the individual's genetic makeup, as shown by SCP-73's anomalous effects on newborn babies as well as several elderly persons. After one week, the subject would acquire knowledge of all subjects they ever knew, as well as their place in society based upon their age (e.g., elementary school students would come to possess an understanding of high school). In addition, subjects would become familiar with any subjects that have previously resided within SCP-73 and may also meet up with them during their eventual removal from SCP-73, as demonstrated by William ████'s unusual behavior after his removal from the home.</p><p>With further research into this activity, it appears that the following are true:</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 73-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, ██████ High School students █████ and ███████ visited SCP-73 for the first time. The two students were removed from SCP-73's walls, as was their friend █████████, who was also present at the time.</p><p>Within 3 days, ███████ and ███████ had become extremely knowledgeable on subjects related to high school and social studies, including subjects related to the subjects they previously did not know, such as American government and history. The subjects had also developed advanced social skills and the ability to use computers and other modern devices.</p><p>A week later, they attempted to visit SCP-73 again, but were removed by the Foundation. On ██/██/████, █████████ returned to SCP-73, claiming that he had become an American history teacher. It is unknown if he has returned to his normal profession or if he is still employed at ██████ High School."]</p>
