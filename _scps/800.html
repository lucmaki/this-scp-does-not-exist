<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-800</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Several instances of SCP-800 are to be kept in a wooden box at Site-77. The lid is to be removed before testing, and replaced afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-800 is a toy train set, comprised of a total of seven vehicles. SCP-800 is powered by batteries, and has no apparent remote control. The gears of all SCP-800 vehicles are similarly mounted to each other, and cannot be removed from the main chassis.</p><p>This anomalous property allows SCP-800 to perform stunts that would be impossible for a regular set. For instance, the locomotive will move off the track and roll away when left unattended. However, if any part of the train is manually moved or affected with an event, it will immediately return to its position on the track. Otherwise, SCP-800 operates as a normal toy would.</p><p>SCP-800 appears to exhibit some degree of sentience in its behavior. More specifically, it responds to its internal clock and seems to display an innate sense of humor in its passing comments after incidents.</p><p>How SCP-800 comes into existance is unknown; however, the Foundation has been aware of it since 1980. Currently no leads have been found regarding how to remove the anomaly without destroying it.</p>
