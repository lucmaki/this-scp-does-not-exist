<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-352</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-352 are to be seized and stored in research facilities at Site-76. Four (4) Level-1 personnel are required for daily maintenance and inspection of the specimens.</p><p>Foundation field agents are to identify, locate and seize or destroy any instances of SCP-352 still in the wild; this includes online stores.</p><p>Foundation Class-A amnestics are to be administered to all witnesses who may have discovered instances of SCP-352 before their destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-352 is a species of succulent, commonly known as a Snake Plant (Sansevieria), native to Africa.</p><p>These plants are often grown in clear plastic cups and sold in retail stores, usually intended for indoor cultivation. SCP-352 was discovered to be very difficult to locate until the method of online shopping was shown to be a possibility.</p><p>When examined under an electron microscope, SCP-352 is seen to have beads colored green with a purple coating on the interior of each bead. These beads were found to be composed of iron oxide and chromium, with the iron oxide being mixed with finely ground plant matter.</p><p>SCP-352 spontaneously produces sap from their stems and leaves which has been noted to contain traces of sugar. The sap also appears to contain one hundred percent human serum albumin. Analysis of the albumin indicates that it belongs to a presumed Caucasian male in his late twenties.</p><p>Commonly found in most instances of SCP-352 are plastic cups; these were found not to be made entirely of plastic, but paperboard, and completely covered in strands of genetically modified plant matter believed to be Dichotomous Recombination DNA, or DRD. DRD causes certain traits within plants to appear at random when recombined with other strains of the same species; this includes human characteristics such as hair color and skin pigmentation. This trait was previously believed only possible with vegetable plants, but evidence shows it can occur within vertebrate plants as well due to exposure."</p><p>It is not currently known whether specimens produced by SCP-352 have any effect on humans with similar DNA sequences.</p><p>Specimen #1: A fully grown specimen possessing all four anomalous traits exclusive to its species.</p><p>Specimen #2: A mature specimen possessing all four anomalous traits; however, it has been observed that pollen from the plant's flowers has been pollinating it, producing pale yellow flowers instead of normal green flowers. This pattern has continued for three consecutive weeks since discovery.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 352-a:</strong> Two weeks after the discovery of SCP-352, it was found that a small plant growing on a nearby table had been pollinated. This plant was observed to grow into a large specimen identical to the original one. This further suggests that its growth is not limited to the original plant, but instead has the ability to grow other plants with similar DNA sequences.']</p>
