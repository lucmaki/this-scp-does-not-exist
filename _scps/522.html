<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-522</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-522 is contained at Site-19. Per standard Foundation procedure, a dedicated research team of researchers from various disciplines are to be present on a daily basis at Site-19 to monitor the behavior of SCP-522. In addition to observation, any research or testing requiring the use of SCP-522 is to be performed with the cooperation of COUNCIL members, as well as personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher.</p><p>All staff members assigned to oversee the containment and monitoring of SCP-522 have been given standard Foundation training in SCP-522-A awareness, as well as maintaining a level of calm composure when interacting with SCP-522. Staff have also been instructed to make use of suitable materials on hand when handling SCP-522.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-522 is a humanoid entity of indeterminate age, gender and race. SCP-522 does not appear to have any natural shape or form, but instead simply exists as an amorphous mass of organic matter. SCP-522 possesses six appendages, which can be loosely described as arms or legs, with additional non-humanoid appendages resembling the structure of a spine. The largest of these appendages share a similar structure to that of SCP-522's head; however no discernable property appears to exist within them.</p><p>SCP-522 is capable of moving despite not exhibiting any "body", possessing incredible dexterity and quickness. Its body is made up of a very light, dark purple material, with a texture that resembles cooked fat, used for lubrication purposes. No other properties have been observed aside from its unusual composition and elasticity. SCP-522 possesses the ability to change its size at will, although this only appears to take place when it encounters other humans (see Addendum 522-1).</p><p>SCP-522 is highly intelligent, able to process human speech accurately despite having no apparent ears or eyes. In addition to speech it has demonstrated an ability to understand complex mathematics and sciences that are universally accepted as impossible for its form (See Testing Logs 522-A and 522-B for details on its mathematical knowledge).</p><p>Additionally, SCP-522 is also capable of producing sounds in order to communicate ("sounds" such as whizzing and hissing), although it generally uses this ability only when communicating with humans; attempting to communicate with it otherwise causes severe pain or discomfort in those who participate in communication. Attempts at communicating with SCP-522 outside of testing were unsuccessful until successful due to circumstances beyond the scope of Foundation influence; however evidence shows that when using D-Class personnel it was indeed attempting to converse with them (see Addendum 522-2).</p><p>SCP-522 was first discovered on 14/06/201█ by Foundation agents embedded within the Cadmus Corporation's research division. During search and retrieval operations, Foundation agents encountered a group of humans who claimed they had been teleported into a room while sitting at their desks by an entity which resembled SCP-522; members proceeded to attempt capture procedures, but were prevented by their employer and all attempts were halted by security personnel. Agents involved in recovery efforts have since suffered severe psychological trauma attributed to their experience (See Interview Log 522).</p><p>It was later found out that the group had been terminated via puppeted explosives implanted around their necks (See Incident Report 522) However following further investigation it was deduced that there were in fact four groups teleported into separate rooms: One was teleported into another building entirely; two groups remained within Site 19's perimeter walls; one group was teleported into an adjacent building (yet far enough away for containment purposes); one group remained outside the facility; four died upon arrival. All participants who survived the initial teleportation would become known as COUNCIL members.</p><p>The presence of four COUNCIL members in close proximity caused extensive psychological damage not only within their own bodies, but also within Foundation facilities where they resided until 37 days after their initial teleportation (See Addendum 522). The psychological damage caused by COUNCIL members has been exacerbated by instilling false memories into their minds as well as various other methods, most notably through use of drugs and torture devices designed by former Cadmus employees designed specifically for use against COUNCIL personnel (See Incident Log 522). Further research on the effects of these methods has been banned since ██/03/201█.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 522-1:</strong></p><p>The following is a log of SCP-522\'s behavior during testing. It is believed that SCP-522 is most likely capable of communicating with human beings without the use of "sounds" as it will not do so unless spoken to by them.</p><p>Test Log 522-A</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 04/12/201█</p><p><strong>Time: ██:██-██:</strong>██</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-619 ("Larson")</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was instructed to sit in a chair in front of a laptop computer and use the mouse to navigate through a series of images.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Upon completing this task, subject began to blink rapidly and repeatedly. At this time, subject began to speak in an extremely monotone voice (see Addendum 522-2 for details). After approximately 20 seconds, subject fell unconscious and was taken for observation. Subject awoke 48 hours later with no recollection of the period between the beginning of the test and the time when he was found unconscious. Following this incident a transcript had to be made for later analysis.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The following is a transcript of the experiment conducted on D-619\'s memory. It is believed that SCP-522 has the ability to alter memories within its proximity, as it has done to D-619\'s memories.</p><p><strong>D-619:</strong> Who am…? Larson how are you?</p><p>[SCP-522 makes no response]</p><p><strong>D-621:</strong> Who are you? [unintelligible]</p><p><strong>D-621:</strong> Who are you? [SCP-522 does not respond] D-619, answer him! He\'s here! What are you? What are you?</p><p><strong>D-619:</strong> I… I don\'t know… I don\'t know! You need to get away from me! You need to leave me alone!</p><p><strong>D-621:</strong> What are you doing? Are you touching me? Stop! Leave me alone!</p><p><strong>D-621:</strong> What are you doing!? What are you doing!? Stop touching me! I don\'t want to be touched!! No! No! Please stop touching me! Get away from me!!! Please get away from me!!! [SCP-522 continues to make contact with D-621] No! Don\'t touch me! Don\'t touch me! No! Nooo! Noooooo!!</p><p>D-621 is observed screaming continuously while SCP-522 remains motionless within its proximity. One minute after the end of the test, D-621 screamed for 1 hour and 42 minutes before slowly collapsing. During this time, SCP-522 remained motionless. D-621 was then revived and appeared unharmed; however he showed signs of extreme physical trauma including burns, bruises and embedded foreign objects within his body (See Incident Report 522). After this incident, all testing involving SCP-522 contained procedures that prevent it from making any contact with human beings; however personnel have reported an increased sensation of "pain" when SCP-522 makes contact with them.</p>
