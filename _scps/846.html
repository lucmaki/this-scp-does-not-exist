<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-846</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation personnel may enter SCP-846 through a secondary access point in the basement. A second door will be sealed off via Foundation security devices if any other civilians or personnel are inside the building.</p><p>Foundation drones have been constructed to store and contain instances of SCP-846-1. Any person inside SCP-846-1 when it is sealed off by the Foundation will become an instance of SCP-846-2 and be taken into Foundation custody. Only a few instances of SCP-846-2 have manifested as living persons, although they display signs of being delusional and/or emotionally unstable. Dr. ███████ will provide psychological reports of every instance once they have been contained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-846 is a tanning salon located in ██████, ██. As of now, the building appears to be abandoned. A single door leads into the basement and has been sealed off with a Foundation security device. The front of the building is empty and appears to be an open space.</p><p>On 12/18/20██, SCP-846 emitted anomalous effects which caused ███ civilians inside the building to become instances of SCP-846-2. Each instance was affected by a different color of SCP-846. This effect only lasted for 0.5 seconds, after which time the humans disappeared back into their body.</p><p>SCP-846-2 have primarily manifested as delusional individuals (see Addendum 846-1). They claim to have lived inside SCP-846 during its active period between 11/21/2012 and 12/18/20██, when they became affected as adults. Most SCP-846-2 exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia, with several displaying signs of hypochondria or anorexia nervosa.</p><p>Dr. ███████ will provide psychological reports from all instances of SCP-846 once they are contained and stabilized.</p>
