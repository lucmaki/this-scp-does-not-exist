<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-136</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> By order of the Foundation, all known instances of SCP-136 are to be permanently acquired by the Foundation and kept in a secure storage locker at Site-██. An audio recording of SCP-136 is to be placed in Storage Vault Gamma-4a for public access.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-136 is an audio recording of a woman's voice stating "Put on your bonnet, dear" several times.</p><p>When played at normal speed, SCP-136 is identical in format to that of a standard pop song. At full speed, however, the metadata and frequency of SCP-136 rapidly increase. SCP-136 continues this until it reaches an unknown maximum speed, beyond which it begins to loop repeatedly. When listened to at its maximum speed (117.9 ms per second), SCP-136 becomes almost exclusively comprised of one phrase "It's Bonnet Day!" This phrase appears throughout the duration of SCP-136 regardless of its actual length.</p><p>SCP-136 will also change periodically during play. These changes are limited to the modification of some lyrics, with the exception of the melody which remains the same throughout. Changes occur approximately every 20 seconds, but have only been observed to occur after 10 minutes or more of SCP-136 being played continuously. The listener is affected similarly to when they hear SCP-136 normally. Attempting to skip ahead from maximum speed will cause further changes to occur as described below:</p><p>SCP-136 always loops back at a single passage when played at maximum speed.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 136.1:</strong> Below is an example of SCP-136 at its maximum speed. The lyrics appear in the following order:</p><p>Put on your bonnet, dear</p><p>It's Bonnet Day!</p><p>Oh, it's so cute!</p><p>Yes, put on your bonnet (bonnet)</p><p>It's Bonnet Day!</p><p>It's Bonnet Day!</p><p>It's Bonnet Day!"]</p>
