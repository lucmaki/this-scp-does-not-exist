<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-507</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-507 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. No liquids are allowed within the vicinity of SCP-507, and all tests involving bodily fluids are to be performed indoors. (See Addendum 505-01)</p><p>SCP-507 is to be fed a mixture of liquefied plastic and gelatinous polysaccharides once every six hours. The exception to this is when testing above Level 2. Any material produced by SCP-507 must be stored in a separate containment locker and may only be made available for testing if there is no other suitable specimen available.</p><p>Any personnel who come into physical contact with SCP-507 must undergo immediate decontamination procedures by members of Level 4 personnel only. Any such materials removed from an individual must also be handled with extreme care until the individual has been decontaminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-507 is the living human skeleton of █████ ██████████, a male infant aged ~1 year at its time of death.</p><p>SCP-507 exhibits a number of properties which strongly suggest that it is not a product of natural selection or mutation. For example:</p><p>All organisms produced by SCP-507 are of human origin, regardless of whether they possess an artificial body part or not; This does not include any make of ammunition, with these products being indistinguishable from any normal human skeleton.</p><p>SCP-507 reacts to liquid substances in a similar manner to ordinary human skin: A single wisp of smoke rises from its mouth when exposed to smokeless tobacco; It is possible for SCP-507 to be submerged in liquid substances, and the liquids will bubble vigorously as if heated; When drinking, SCP-507 will cough and spit up whatever liquid it drank, and does not appear to show any interest in what has been drank.</p><p>After an unknown period of time (See Addendum 505-01), SCP-507 will begin to produce miniature replicas of various liquefied plastic objects. These polymers are most commonly composed of polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohol, though polypropylene glycol has also been observed. These polymers have no discernible effects on SCP-507's behaviour or appearance despite being digested in the same way as any other organic matter. The production rate consistent with these products is approximately one per hour.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 505-01:</strong> SCP-507 was first discovered by the Foundation on ██/██/1989 after a routine investigation of a child abduction case in ██████, ██. The child, █████ ███████████ (now known as "C-507"), was reported missing by his parents on ██/██/1989 at approximately 17:30, and was later recovered alive at approximately 19:00. C-507\'s parents claimed that he had been kidnapped by a man who had threatened to kill them if they did not give him $5,000.</p><p>The description given by C-507\'s parents matched that of █████ █████████. The parents claimed that the man was driving a van with the words "The First Boy Appears" written on it. The Foundation investigated the scene, and found several empty liquor bottles and an empty package of "The First Boy Appears" shaped gelatinous polysaccharides on the ground. A search of the van yielded cigarettes, a piece of paper with a crude drawing of an infant skeleton, and a photograph labeled "First Baby". The photograph shows a male infant aged 5 months at the time of the photograph.</p><p>A search of public records led to the discovery of █████████\'s family. His mother had died in childbirth, and his father had remarried three weeks later. The new wife, ███████ █████████ (now known as "First Wife") had disappeared on [REDACTED], three months after giving birth to their son, █████ █████████ (now known as "Second Son"). A search of the local cemetery revealed that she had been buried next to her husband, who had previously been buried there.</p><p>A body examination performed on First Wife\'s body indicated that she had been pregnant during her disappearance, and that she had died shortly afterwards from complications related to her pregnancy. A further examination of █████████\'s body showed that he had been killed by blunt trauma to the head.</p><p>A search of local funeral homes revealed that SCP-507 was scheduled for burial with First Wife in six days. The meeting between C-507 and SCP-507 took place at her funeral, and resulted in the infant being taken into custody by Foundation agents.']</p>
