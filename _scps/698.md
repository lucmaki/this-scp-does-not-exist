<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-698</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-698 must be kept in a reinforced-concrete box, 1m x 1m x 1m. The top of the box must be padded with cotton wool to prevent damage from the item. Daily checks for degradation in properties, such as melting or evaporation, are required to ensure the integrity of the object.</p><p>The containment cell must be kept at 12 °C and 40% humidity at all times. The temperature inside the cell may only be lowered by as much as 2 °C per day.</p><p>Personnel entering the cell must wear full protective suits with full body sealing components (due to the possibility of SCP-698 "melting" any uncovered skin). Whenever possible, all personnel engaging with SCP-698 should be equipped with waterproof breathing apparatus, high-pressure self-contained air tanks, and communication devices connected to Site-19.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-698 is a semi-spherical object, weighing [DATA EXPUNGED]kg and measuring [DATA EXPUNGED]m in diameter. The object is composed of what appears to be molten glass, though the internal structure of the sphere has not been discovered by analysis. It is also self-repairing as long as sufficient oxygen is present.</p><p>SCP-698 retains most of its properties at temperatures below 100 °C. However, it also possesses several anomalous properties at elevated temperatures, similar to SCP-████. SCP-698 will occasionally "gum up" on itself, resulting in an inability for both outside and inside surfaces to maintain smooth contact with each other. When objects come into contact with this gagging effect, the temperature inside SCP-698 will rise rapidly enough to cause the object's surface to melt.</p><p>Several methods have been used to remove SCP-698 from containment, with varying results. Most attempts used magnets and large magnets have resulted in failure due to the anomalous properties of SCP-698. Other methods such as using air pressure to blow out some of the interior contents have only succeeded in causing SCP-698 to "smoke" or become covered with a thin layer of glass over the entire interior; attempts have failed on many occasions due to loss of containment integrity due to SCP-698's properties.</p><p>In addition, samples that are recovered from inside SCP-698 (for which no outside source can be determined) appear warped or warped in a random direction relative to the original sample. Samples collected after an "event", such as when an attempt was made to remove SCP-698 from containment, usually appear warped in the same way that they were initially produced.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 698-1:</strong> SCP-698 was discovered on ██/██/19██ in a warehouse in ███████, Australia. The object's anomalous properties were discovered when [REDACTED] attempted to remove SCP-698 from containment. Upon contact with the surface of SCP-698, the temperature inside the object rose rapidly. [DATA EXPUNGED]."]</p>
