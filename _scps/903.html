<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-903</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-903 is to be contained in a large containment unit located on the grounds of Site-62. Due to its size, SCP-903 is kept on a small area of land situated off the main campus. The cost of maintenance of this area has been estimated at approximately $15 per day, or approximately $60 per month. This cost increases to $80 per month when feeding takes place.</p><p>The surrounding area is fenced off and patrolled by security personnel at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-903 is a species of large grass commonly known as "twenty-five o'clock" grass. The grass appears to be a genetically modified version of the common garden variety, having been bred for its size and strength. When SCP-903 is agitated or alarmed, it extends telescopically along the ground to approximately 25 meters in length. At this point, SCP-903 becomes a plant-like entity, capable of moving throughout the facility at speeds of up to 30Â km/h with ease. SCP-903 will attempt to explore any new area it's placed in, only stopping when it finds itself unable to move farther. Once SCP-903 has traveled far enough, it reverts back into a regular grass and grows over itself.</p><p>SCP-903 takes on a humanoid appearance if it brushes against an individual's leg or arm. Those who come into contact with SCP-903 report feeling an almost electrical sensation as they make contact; this sensation only occurs while they're still within 50 meters of SCP-903 and lasts roughly five seconds (with the exception of Long John Silvers).</p><p>The anomalous properties of SCP-903 become active once it is within approximately 300 meters of another human being; thus, care should be taken when observing or handling SCP-903.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 903-1:</strong> At the time of this writing, SCP-903's anomalous properties have not yet been tested.</p>
