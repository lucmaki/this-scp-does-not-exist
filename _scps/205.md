<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-205</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-205 is to be kept in a standard containment storage locker. No experiments involving SCP-205 are to be performed without at least one (1) Level 3 personnel present.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-205 is a plastic sphere, 33 mm in diameter, that appears to be composed of several different types of hard plastics. The interior surface of SCP-205 is lined with a semi-flexible blue rubber membrane. When any object is inserted into SCP-205 and the lid is closed, it will produce a rotating or vibrating effect that appears to originate from the center of SCP-205.</p><p>SCP-205 was recovered during an accidental theft at a juvenile detention center in Mission Viejo, California, after witnesses reported seeing an unidentified man (described as "a large white male") fiddling with an object for some time before placing it under his shirt. A search of the facility revealed SCP-205, along with the man.</p><p>The other objects recovered from the subject were nonanomalous. However, testing shows that this object is capable of causing damage when used improperly by persons other than those inside it. For example, when used on any living organism without prior preparation on its part or suitable protective equipment on their part (such as a body glove), it can cause extreme pain and even irreversible damage. When placed into storage, local fire department officials have reported minor injuries resulting from spontaneous combustion caused by heat buildup inside SCP-205 due to the cloth being stored next to a heater or oven.</p><p>It should be noted that there has not been one single case of spontaneous combustion due to SCP-205 causing any sort of damage. All recorded instances have been triggered by subjects trying to use SCP-205's effects improperly.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 205-1:</strong> The following is a transcript of the recorded interview between SCP-205 and Dr. ████████, who was inspecting SCP-205 during its containment.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> So, what exactly is this?</p><p><strong>SCP-205:</strong> I'm a magic sphere of varying degrees of power. I can teach you how to use my powers, or I can destroy you with it.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Well, we'll see about that. Can you tell me what you do?</p><p><strong>SCP-205:</strong> There aren't many people in this world that know the truth about me. That's why I'm in here, isn't it?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Um, well… yes and no.</p><p><strong>SCP-205:</strong> Yes, I am here to protect you from my other abilities. I'm here to teach you how to use them safely. But I'm also here because of your inability to control them.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> [shakes head] Right. What do you do exactly?</p><p><strong>SCP-205:</strong> [pause] Let me show you. [hand movement] There's a lot more to it than that, but let's start simple. [hand movement] Take a deep breath for me… [hand movement] Now, think of one thing that makes you happy, something that makes you smile again and again… [hand movement] Now, focus on that thought for a moment… [hand movement] Feel it pulse through your head… [hand movement] It's not just yours anymore… you're sharing it with everyone in the room… [hand movement] Now try to move beyond it… [hand motion begins to slow down] keep going deeper now… deeper… [hand motion slows down to a stop abruptly] That's right, now I want you to push it deeper still… push it deeper into every part of your body until there's nothing else left but that feeling… Keep breathing deeply as you do this…. [Pause.] Sorry, those were my last instructions before I had to get out of the cell; they'd be very hard to follow if this thing could kill us all in an instant. How are you doing so far?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> [surprised chuckle] I'm doing fine so far; feel like I've been punched in the chest several times already. What else can it do?</p><p><strong>SCP-205:</strong> You said everything makes you happy, remember? Now think of all the things terrible things have happened to you in your life; think about how hard it is to sit and watch someone die that you loved very much and how little hope you have at trying to change the outcome no matter how much effort you put into it… Think about all the times someone close to you has treated you badly but didn't know what else to do other than hurt or silence you… Think about the things that happened to your childhood and all the years ahead of you that will never be happy again… and when you're done with all of those things, think about all the things that have made you smile since they began happening haven't they?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> [pause] Yes…</p><p><strong>SCP-205:</strong> I'm glad my time here will be good for you at least, even if it takes a while for that happiness to come back around again. And now, let's try some more creative exercises… maybe something a little more fun?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> [nods slowly] Okay, fine by me; anything for a better mood.</p><p><strong>SCP-205:</strong> Good boy! Now close your eyes and think about something else for a moment… remember how great life is when things are going your way… being able to play hooky from school when everyone else is working when no one needs them at home… remember how great it feels when two people that love each other show their love in different ways… how wonderful it is when a job goes well enough and no one gets hurt along the way… take everything in for a moment and feel it all running through your veins like blood pumping through your body… This is what I give people who open their eyes every morning and wish this kind of fun could stay forever without ever having reason to notice anything but their good fortune thanks to whatever sort of luck they have on their side and then they go on with their lives thinking they're lucky and contented little beings with nothing more pressing on their minds than enjoying their lives and never wanting anything more than what they have right now… Tell me what happens once they take my sphere away from them though… do they ever feel more than just contentment anymore?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> No doubt they do, once they realize what they've lost once more.</p><p><strong>SCP-205:</strong> Exactly! If only everyone knew how lucky they were. Then we wouldn't need me anymore!</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> [leans back in his chair after leaning forward slightly upon hearing this statement] You know, when did you become such an optimist? You should stick with your original plan then; if everybody found out how lucky they were like this, there would be too many people on our hands looking for happiness everywhere but within themselves or too many people would be too happy to care about any other happiness outside of themselves making a mess out of everything else the world has to offer."]</p>
