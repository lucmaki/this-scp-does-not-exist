<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-466</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-466 is contained at Site-██ in an area made inaccessible to the general public, on-site secure perimeter established around the object in accordance with standard protocols for Euclid Class Keter-class objects. Instances of SCP-466-1 are to be contained in secure humanoid containment chambers or a small quarantine room, and monitored for any unexpected changes in behavior. Instances of SCP-466-2 are to be contained in isolation chambers with limited communication and restricted amounts of outside resources.</p><p>Subjects that become infected with SCP-466 are to be quarantined for one month after onset. The quarantine period is to be extended by one week for each month of the subject's life expectancy (up to a maximum of five months). Subjects that survive this period are Class I amnesticized and terminated.</p><p>The Foundation has no relations with individuals involved with the creation of new instances of SCP-466. If a new instance is created via any means other than existing instances, it is to be immediately neutralized using standard Class A amnestic protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-466 is a set of six symbiont pairs, hereafter SCP-466-1 and -2. Instances of SCP-466 range from humans to roughly the size of small dogs, although SCP-466-1 instances are always cephalopod and SCP-466-2 instances always human.</p><p>SCP-466's effects manifest upon exposure to one or more instances of SCP-466. The extent of this effect varies depending on the number of instances present.</p><p>The life expectancy of a subject exposed to an instance of SCP-466 increases by one year for each instance present. This does not apply if the subject is exposed after reaching the age of 40, or if two or more instances are present. Subjects do not experience any other change in behavior, including increase in physical activity or changes in mental or emotional state. In addition, all subjects exposed to SCP-466 report no change whatsoever in their lives other than increased longevity.</p><p>All subjects that become infected with SCP-466 report experiencing a series of hallucinations, ranging from vague sensations to highly specific sequences of events. These hallucinations typically involve talking animals, who provide advice and instruction on how to survive in a particular environment.</p><p>If two instances are present during an exposure, the effect extends to include members of the same species; however, only one instance at time can be contacted and instructed on survival techniques.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
