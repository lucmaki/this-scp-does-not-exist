<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-312</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-312 is to be contained in a 9m x 3m x 3m storage chamber located at Area-12, accessible by use of an SCP-312-1 keycard. SCP-312 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber with a temperature that is conducive to keeping it at its ambient temperature of 15°C ± 2°C. Any personnel are to be kept at a distance of 5m from the door leading into the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-312 is a computer running Windows XP, originally installed by IT personnel of [REDACTED] Ltd. It is believed that SCP-312 was brought in through an employee's laptop which had been infected with the WannaCry ransomware virus.</p><p>When a subject approaches within 3 meters of SCP-312, approximately 10 white lines begin to appear in front of it around its visual field. The first of these lines will appear on line 3,843 of the screen. These lines increase in length until they reach line 904,625. If a subject looks directly at the screen when this occurs, they will be rendered temporarily unable to move or consciously process information.</p><p>Subjects will recover after three minutes of looking at the screen. The longer a subject looks at the screen, the more lines will be produced and the longer it will take for them to recover from viewing it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
