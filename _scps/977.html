<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-977</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-977 is to be kept in a storage room in Site-73's high security wing. Only research staff with level 3 clearance or higher are to be allowed within the room. A guard is stationed outside of SCP-977's containment room.</p><p>If an unauthorized individual wishes to enter SCP-977's containment area, they must submit a written request outlining the reasons for their visit and requesting permission from Dr. ████████. Written requests must be sent via regular post and posted to the receptionist desk at Site-73's main entrance. All requests must be approved by a member of the current research team at Site-73.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-977 is a black leather-bound book with the words “To My Beloved Son, With Love” stamped in gold leaf on its front cover. When opened, it appears to be a Bible. The pages of the book are blank, and there are no markings indicating where the text should begin. The pages are bound together by what appear to be iron clasps with a king's crown symbol on them.</p><p>When any individual opens SCP-977, they will be transported to a location determined by the contents of the pages currently being opened. Subjects who have not been exposed to SCP-977 prior to its acquisition report that they felt as though they had travelled through time and space before arriving at their destination.</p><p>SCP-977's effects were first observed when an individual (later identified as D-1272) opened the book and was transported to an area comprising an abandoned section of a railway station and several disused train carriages which had been made into living quarters. The word 'god' was written in marker pen in large letters across one of the walls of one of the carriages. There were several empty bottles of vodka scattered across the floor and table covers bearing images of various religious symbols such as crosses and crescents.</p><p>D-1272 stated that he had arrived in an area similar to his local town's station; he also claimed that he had been transported to this location after hearing about SCP-977 from another member of staff at Site-73 who had visited him in hospital following a suicide attempt.</p><p>SCP-977 was discovered in February 2009, when a group of junior researchers were working late one night on unrelated projects when they became aware of extensive activity within Site-73's high security wing. Due to these reports, all researchers are now required to notify at least one supervising researcher when they will be performing any work involving SCP-977.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
