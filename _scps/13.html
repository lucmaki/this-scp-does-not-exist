<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-13</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> An electronic fence has been constructed around the location of SCP-13. Periodic inspections are to be conducted of the fence to ensure that no openings in the fence exist. All personnel entering and exiting SCP-13 must enter and exit through the facility's front door.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-13 is the subject of an urban legend affecting ██ families in Arizona, USA. The stories differ, but the commonality is that the subject is a house that can only be entered during one's dreams. Attempts to sleep in or wake the subject by any other means fail to work. There are no reports of anyone and anything being able to enter or leave SCP-13, and attempts to move through it or shape its objects have failed regardless of success.</p><p>Each night, one section of the wall between SCP-13 and the outside becomes transparent, meaning that anyone inside may see through to the outside world.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-13 was found in █████, Arizona on 7/16/19██. The house is a two-story structure with a porch extending out the front and an upstairs balcony. A large stack of papers was left on the ground outside the house, but no one was found around to pick them up. When the papers were opened, they contained copies of a letter from the town's mayor and several pages from a diary. An investigation of the house showed that it had been abandoned for many years.</p><p>The front door opens from the inside when opened from within; however, movement through the door does not open it from the outside, as would be expected of a normal door. After being opened from inside, the door may be closed normally without opening it from the inside.</p>
