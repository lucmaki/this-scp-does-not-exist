<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-572</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-572 is to be contained within one (1) sealed containment unit. No personnel are allowed within the inner chamber of the containment unit under any circumstances. A full complement of on-site personnel are to be prepared to enter the chamber when a test with SCP-572 is required.</p><p>All personnel entering the containment unit must wear flammable protective clothing and equipment, including gloves and emergency respirators, prior to entering. The inner chamber is to be equipped with a pyrotechnic alarm system before it can be entered. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to enter the chamber will activate the alarm and request additional emergency personnel, who will respond as instructed.</p><p>The entrance to SCP-572's containment unit is surrounded by a twelve (12) meter high blast wall of steel, lined with [REDACTED] fill, reinforced with multiple layers of concrete, in order to withstand any possible blasts from SCP-572.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-572 is a creature commonly described as resembling a two (2) meter wide, pale green monster with large, bulbous ears and a large, crescent-shaped mouth. SCP-572 has been observed to occasionally open its mouth while in its inactive state, but has yet to attempt to make any vocalizations.</p><p>SCP-572 is capable of moving at a maximum speed of twenty (20) km/h over short distances, however it appears to prefer to stay within the confines of its sealed containment unit. SCP-572 will occasionally generate a blinding white flash of light during the day, and appear at night in an inaccessible area around its containment unit.</p><p>Only personnel that remain within the inner chamber of SCP-572's containment unit for at least seventy-two (72) hours are able to make observations on the entity from a close range. During this time period, personnel have noted that SCP-572 will be able to manipulate small items of metal within the unit and will attempt to remove these objects from its immediate vicinity whenever possible. It possesses no discernible means of locomotion or transportation outside the sealed containment unit.</p><p>According to reports from Dr. Rennard, who spent three years observing SCP-572, "the entity will occasionally place objects in sealed metal containers and move them to different locations within the chamber; when exposed to humans, it has been observed dragging items and objects towards people that could potentially be used by itself." No physical evidence has been found regarding these actions, suggesting that SCP-672 uses anti-material constructs in place of conventional vehicles.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Incident Log SCP-572-A</p><p>On ██/██/████, SCP-572's containment unit was allowed to enter an active state for the first time. Upon activation, SCP-572 made its way towards the inner chamber of its containment unit before releasing a large sheet of material. This sheet of material was approximately one (1) meter thick and nine (9) meters wide, and appeared to be made up of cloth, paper, and metal in some fashion. SCP-572 then attempted to drag this material towards Dr. Rennard's position before being stopped by its containment unit. The object was later identified as a [DATA EXPUNGED] tablecloth.</p><p>After the incident, Dr. Rennard returned to his position with the tablecloth and attempted to open it. It was noted that the cloth had been ripped into four (4) different sections. After opening the section that had been ripped, Dr. Rennard discovered a [DATA EXPUNGED]. The remaining three sections were located within Dr. Rennard's personal belongings.</p><p>After an investigation into the actions of SCP-572 on ██/██/████, it was found that the entity had attempted to open three (3) other sealed containers while under its inactive state, labeling each container with a number corresponding to the container's location in Dr. Rennard's personal belongings. These noted containers contained [DATA EXPUNGED], a [DATA EXPUNGED], two (2) unidentifiable pills and a [DATA EXPUNGED]. The entity has since been contained in its inactive state."]</p>
