<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-57</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A small containment tank has been constructed to hold SCP-57. A remote camera has been installed in the tank, and a steel grate has been affixed over the top of the tank preventing entry by any form of dangerous sea creature.</p><p>SCP-57 is to be fed cooked meals at regular intervals, and water is to be provided via a water spigot. Personnel are prohibited from swimming in or observing the testing chamber when SCP-57 is present, as aggressive behavior has resulted in damage to laboratory equipment and personnel.</p><p>Any questions regarding SCP-57 are to be directed to Dr. Harry Suitor, Research Lead.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-57 is a small anemone-like organism, approximately 2 cm in diameter, with a single eye in the center of its body. SCP-57 shows no signs of growth or development, and only one tentacle protrudes from the gas bladder at all times. SCP-57 does not appear to age, and does not show any symptoms of injury or disease.</p><p>SCP-57 is extremely aggressive when presented with other organisms, either by striking them with its tentacles or pulling them into its body. While active, SCP-57 will continue to consume any foreign objects pulled into it, regardless of what kind of organism it was originally collecting (sea squids are the most common form).</p><p>While inactive, SCP-57 resides in the center of its containment tank and accumulates sustenance by consuming food particles and sea water. A remote camera has been installed into the tank to monitor as much behavior and activity as possible.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 57-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-57 displayed an extremely aggressive behavior when introduced with a sea squid, and attempted to consume it. The sea squid was able to escape SCP-57's tentacle before being consumed.</p><p>SCP-57 ceased feeding immediately after this event, and refused to consume anything for the next three days. On ██/██/████, SCP-57 began consuming food particles again, and has remained active since.</p>
