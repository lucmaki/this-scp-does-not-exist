<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-100</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-100 is kept within a locked box in secure storage. SCP-100's anomalous properties should be ignored until it has expired.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-100 is a pair of red socks. Testing has shown that, after SCP-100 has expired, it will begin to emit a putrid odor and lose its anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-100 can also be used to detect the presence of blood and other biological fluids in an environment. Any biological fluid that enters SCP-100's area of effect will cause it to stir slightly, even if it is not alive or moving (See Experiment Log 100A).</p><p>The first recorded expiration date for SCP-100 was on June 15th, 1986, after which it did not expire until May 20th, 1991.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 1:</strong> The following document is the record of a test conducted on May 20th, 1991.</p><p>The experiment was conducted in a Class D personnel containment chamber. D-1363 was instructed to wipe off all bodily fluids from his body and insert two fingers into SCP-100's area of effect. D-1363 was given a maximum of 5 minutes to perform this task.</p><p><strong>D-1363:</strong> I'm doing it!</p><p>SCP-100 immediately began to stir and emit a putrid odor. After an hour and a half, the SCP-100 had expired and began to show signs of decomposition.</p><p><strong>D-1363:</strong> So, what did it do?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> What did it do? Well, not much. I doubt it gave you any pleasure at all.</p><p><strong>D-1363:</strong> But did it work?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Not really. I wouldn't expect anything to work on you after that trick.</p><p><strong>D-1363:</strong> Hey, wtf? I thought you said it worked! That thing just… died!</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> I didn't say it worked. I said it worked on other people. I'm sure it's interesting for your peers, but for us it just means more rubbish in our trashcan.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> D-1363 has been released from custody with no further anomalous effects."]</p>
