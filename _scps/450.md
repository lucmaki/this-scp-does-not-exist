<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-450</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation possesses a fleet of Cheyenne-class light cruisers, equipped with the standard containment and shielding systems employed by the Foundation. A single Cheyenne-class light cruiser, designated SCP-450, is to be kept in Foundation custody at all times.</p><p>SCP-450 is to remain within containment for its own protection, and for the purpose of providing cover for Foundation operations against novel anomalous objects.</p><p>Any attempt at physically removing SCP-450 from containment without express permission from Level 4 personnel is to be treated as Class III Incident: Protocol Delegatio Omnia Verba. Failure to comply with this protocol may result in the death of all personnel involved in said operation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-450 is a black 1935 Dodge touring car, built for wealthy American heiress Evalyn Knapp.</p><p>SCP-450 is capable of autonomous movement via the use of an onboard AI. SCP-450 has been observed to travel between [DATA EXPUNGED] and other cities, including [EXPUNGED]. SCP-450 is not affected by shielding or other anomalous forces. SCP-450 does not exhibit any anomalous properties when traveling inside Foundation facilities. SCP-450 does not appear to be directly connected to any anomalous objects, functions, or entities.</p><p>Were it to be removed from containment, SCP-450 would attempt to return to its current location within 14 days.</p><p>Attempts at removing SCP-450 from its current location have resulted in the death of numerous individuals and damage to Foundation facilities used in testing related to SCP-450 (see Incident Log 450).</p><p>Incident 450/5: On 20/09/2009, personnel monitoring the cameras positioned around the site where SCP-450 was stored were surprised to witness the car traveling rapidly toward Site 19's main entrance. At this point, all attempts at halting SCP-450 were rendered moot. Fortunately, personnel stationed at the entrance managed to capture a few still images of SCP-450 with their cell phone cameras before the car moved into an area that obscured the view of its license plate. The guard on duty during this incident reported finding a small envelope attached to the windshield at that time. The envelope was subsequently opened by security personnel and contained a note that read "You need blood". After several attempts by security personnel to contact the original sender through voice mail and email failed horribly, communication was reestablished with Agent ██████'s handler in order that she be questioned as to the whereabouts of her employer. According to Agent ██████'s handler, Agent ██████ had appeared shaken up and appeared unwilling or unable to discuss any information regarding her past experiences with SCP-███ during class that day. Due to severe losses in Class D staffing due to high attrition rate among these workers over █ months per year, such incidents are not uncommon and do not require immediate action from Level 3 personnel unless accompanied by damaging physical manifestations.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of the audio recording made by Agent ██████ during one of her classes in 1989. Agent ██████ has been consulted on various occasions regarding the nature and behavior of SCP-███, and is considered to be knowledgeable in this area.</p><p><strong>Transcript:</strong></p><p>[The sound of pencil hitting desk, followed by a male voice speaking quietly]</p><p><strong>Male speaker:</strong> I\'m here today to talk about anomalous objects. Specifically, we\'re going to be talking about SCP-███. There\'s no need to panic, and there\'s no need to leave the room; we\'re just going to talk about it for a little bit.</p><p>[The sound of pencil hitting desk. A female voice speaks]</p><p><strong>Female speaker:</strong> Okay, so… how are you supposed to learn about something like this if you don\'t hear about it first?</p><p><strong>Male speaker:</strong> Well, I can tell you about it. There\'s… there\'s an object that\'s been around for um… forever. It\'s called SCP-███, or SCP-1710. It was first discovered in 1710, in ████████, Illinois, and it caused a lot of problems in the area. The town wasn\'t affected as much as other towns nearby because it was originally placed in a house rather than a public place, but after some time it… got expelled into the air. It doesn\'t do anything when it\'s out in the open; it just sits there until someone tries to make contact with it or tries to use it. Then it gets sick and dies off.</p><p><strong>Female speaker:</strong> So how does one get rid of something like that?</p><p><strong>Male speaker:</strong> Well, that depends on what kind of person you are. If you\'re not capable of making contact with it or contacting it then you might want to stay away from it entirely. If you\'re not capable of staying far away from it then… well, it\'s probably best not to become a target for it.</p><p><strong>Female speaker:</strong> What are you talking about? That sounds like a fairy tale! A story your mom told you!</p><p><strong>Male speaker:</strong> No, no. Everything I\'m telling you is true. An object like that can actually kill people, if they try to use it without knowing what they\'re doing.</p><p><strong>Female speaker:</strong> That doesn\'t sound very nice… but why are you telling me this? Where\'s the class? Why are you talking to me?</p><p><strong>Male speaker:</strong> Look around you. Do you see any other students who aren\'t doing anything? You\'re the only one who\'s not paying attention right now. Now, I\'m going to ask you a question; answer it as honestly as possible. Do you think anyone else would really care if they knew about this object? That\'s right, no one else would care at all. They wouldn\'t give two shits about this thing because there\'s nothing that can be done about it anyway. But I know people who might care about this thing… people who understand what this thing is and how dangerous it can be if used incorrectly… I\'m going to tell you a little secret: SCP-1710 doesn\'t kill people. What killed them was the death itself, from old age or from illness or from disease or from some other accident or something else altogether… but if people knew about this thing, then maybe there would be some way to prevent its usage altogether instead of just being killed once someone tries to use it improperly.</p><p><strong>Female speaker:</strong> Wait… wait, wait! You said "some way"… what do you mean by "some way"? You just said that there was no way to stop this thing!</p><p><strong>Male speaker:</strong> There is a way, yes; I\'m still trying to figure out how that could be done while still keeping the secrecy intact if people knew about this thing already… but there is a way that won\'t kill anyone directly and won\'t destroy the world either. There\'s a way for everyone involved in this situation, so let\'s talk about that for a bit more before we call it quits for today, okay? Come on; let\'s finish this up so we can all go home and get some sleep tonight.</p><p>[The sound of pencil hitting desk again as the female voice speaks]</p><p><strong>Female speaker:</strong> You said something would happen "if people knew" about SCP-1710; what exactly are you proposing here? And what makes you think that I could have any part in any of this "secrecy" stuff?</p><p><strong>Male speaker:</strong> [pause] You\'ll find out soon enough. Just think about what I told you; that should help you decide whether or not this information is useful for you or not. My name is Dr ████████████; I work for a Foundation task force dedicated solely to investigating anomalous objects like SCP-1710 and preventing their misuse in the future. I\'ve personally worked on 15 different cases relating to SCP-1710 since its discovery in 1710 and believe me when I say that most of them could have been prevented if more people knew about them beforehand. Most of those cases were related directly to the death of these objects; most were caused by people who did not know how dangerous these objects were and how great a risk they posed if used improperly – but not all of them were like that. Not all the deaths were caused by misusing the objects; some were caused by elderly people who had contracted diseases such as cancer or heart disease due to unrelated causes and then died while undergoing treatment for those diseases – which didn\'t help much at all when they had already died as well – or illnesses brought on through exposure to radiation or nerve gas given off by these objects themselves – which didn\'t help at all because they had already been exposed anyways – or through accidents involving these objects either breaking or getting knocked over on their own when they weren\'t being used properly – which didn\'t help at all because they had already broken either unintentionally or purposefully before they got into any trouble with the objects themselves – and finally, we had another case where an animal died after having been hit by one of these objects while being transported inside a car – which would have been fine if someone hadn\'t decided to drive around with an unconscious dog inside their vehicle for several hours before anyone realized that their pet had died on them earlier – but since nobody had known about SCP-1710 beforehand then nobody would have even noticed the dog had died on them until later when they\'d realized that their pet wasn\'t home anymore… so those kinds of deaths are definitely better than the kind of deaths where people just die from old age or disease or accident or anything else that just happens naturally without anyone ever being around at all; much less being aware that anything bad had happened at all until much later than would have otherwise happened otherwise… but even those kinds of deaths are preventable if more people knew about these things beforehand… so don\'t worry too much about what I just said; I know what I\'m talking about and so do most other Foundation agents involved in these kinds of investigations currently active on Earth right now']</p>
