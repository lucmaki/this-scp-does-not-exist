<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-956</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-956 is to be kept in a standard test chamber at Site-███, with one (1) cover to be removed from the chamber as needed. Every three (3) months, SCP-956 must be fed two (2) small meals of raw chicken. In addition, approximately once a year, SCP-956 should be sprayed down with deionized water and allowed to air dry for four (4) minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-956 is a small grayish-white rodent with gray fur and dark brown eyes. Its head is somewhat larger than its body, with the skull being thinner than that of most rodents. The animal's fur is dense but shorter than that of most rodents, and it appears to have no tail.</p><p>SCP-956 will occasionally gnaw on any solid surface available to it, especially in areas where it has previously lived. If these surfaces are not provided as food or shelter, SCP-956 will instead begin to scratch at them with its claws. It is unknown if this behavior is a form of self-defense or an attempt at communication. Once an area has been scratched through four (4) times, it will begin to show signs of wear. If left in its current state for longer than three months, it will begin to crack and crumble.</p><p>SCP-956 may also be found scratching on the inside of its containment chamber; however, this behavior has never been observed outside of testing. Maintenance personnel must make arrangements to keep SCP-956's containment chamber clean and free from scratches; otherwise, SCP-956 may present a health risk to others within the facility through its tendency to bite or scratch.</p><p>SCP-956 was recovered from ████████, CA in 1997 after local hunters were alerted by SCP-956's constant scratching and gnawing on trees and fences in the area. Foundation agents arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and secured SCP-956 without incident.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Interview Log 956-1</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ████████</p><p><strong>Interview Date:</strong> March 1st, 2007</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-956</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Good morning, SCP-956. Please state your name for the record.</p><p><strong>SCP-956:</strong> (scratching) my name? I\'m Scratcher!</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Thank you, SCP-956; how are you today? Can you understand me?</p><p><strong>SCP-956:</strong> I hear ya, Doc. My teeth is a mess, but they\'re gonna take care of that soon enough. How\'s it goin\'?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Well, I hope all went well during your trip here from ████, although I do apologize for not being able to meet you personally. I\'m sure it was very frightening for you as a young animal to be transported so far away from your family and home, especially on an airplane so new that most animals aren\'t accustomed to flying yet. Was it hard for you?</p><p><strong>SCP-956:</strong> At first it was kinda scary, yeah. But… well, I kinda got used to it after a while. It\'s not like when Dad brought me here to see Dadda once before! It really wasn\'t bad at all after the first day or two, though. I mean… what\'s the big deal about flying anyway? It\'s just one big wind tunnel with people yelling at ya every few seconds for no reason at all! What idiot put that up there? Reminds me of being in the NVA back in \'Nam! Yah don\'t wanna be here! Come on! We\'ll take flight this very second if ye please! If ye do not wish to soar with us now was the time to say so before we took off! (laughs) You did good on the flight today, kid; we made it just in time for breakfast! (laughs) Oh man… this is great! It\'s like when we used to fly out over the Tien Shan Mountains! That really was awesome fun… talking about the good old days again eh Doc? Yeah… watching trees fall from the sky and shit is pretty cool even without medicine to help make it more okay… Great adventure over there weren\'t we? Did they send us home? Did they acknowledge our sacrifice and dedication by showing us any respect whatsoever or anything at all? No way man… no way at all… That is crazy talk right there Doc; how can they be so absolutely horrible and uncaring towards something we did for them? And yea… what were those motherfuckers doing over there in the Westwoods by themselves anyways? None of \'em could fight worth a damn and were just sitting around like ducks in a pond they never saw whales fly past them like swallows sailing into their shithole town and carrying their trash away with them onto garbage ships heading straight back towards where they came from didn\'t it Doc? They weren\'t even supposed to be in Vietnam to begin with either weren\'t they Doc? Like we told \'em before when we got our asses handed to us by them billion dollar mercenary jackboots hogging elite soldiers left and right for themselves after losing both regular infantrymen and their own air force oh yea… (snippets of gunfire from audio recorded during SCP-956\'s containment occur) Don\'t trust these fuckers ever; never trust nobody that doesn\'t have nothing against themselves unless you\'re ready and able to kick ass yourself for real no matter what kind of injury or ailment you\'ve got going on because some day someone might decide that you\'re worth taking alive so long as you can sit still long enough or get forced into doing what they want long enough they don\'t ever want anyone else going anywhere near any place even if they\'re already there especially if they\'re already there as their guests prey on them until they\'ve had their fill then move on according to plan leaving a pile of bones behind as a warning sign should anybody else try going anywhere near somewhere else or doing something usual escapees usually carry with them instructions on how to properly get through anywhere that gets taken out by lead or whatever was thrown at \'em "Find anything interesting?" probably not most likely unless some kind of infernal bounty was placed upon an entire nation trying to get food for themselves after some sort of famine hits or similar godswill something like that gets eaten up by idiots without proper preparation so why would anyone bother helping anyone else anymore after enough time has passed since many have died off only leaving those left alive with nothing left worthwhile left over afterwards eating everything left behind including the dead which would have been alive back then before their arrival anyway who cares ya know ya can just make more like scum eating shit always looking forward to digging up fresh human meat alright make sure yer getting plenty too oh wait forgot yer still new here as well maybe i\'ll mention that again next time if yer not sure yer getting enough seeya later (clears throat twice then chuckles) Oh wait forgot something sounds keep your mind clear o\'course stay focused yeah yeah remember this stuff be safe out there or don\'t get bit by anything that bites anything isn\'t guaranteed safe especially those tasty looking things that carry fire ants hang tight be careful don\'t let \'em bite ya too much so ye don\'t forget everything okay bye Doc <End Log></p><p><strong>Addendum 956-2:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-956 began to violently struggle and scratch at the walls of its containment chamber. After breaking the glass in the back wall of its enclosure, SCP-956 then attempted to flee through the broken area, but was subdued and tranquilized by on-site personnel before it could escape. Despite this, SCP-956 is currently displaying a marked level of aggression towards personnel assigned to its containment.', "Addendum 956-3: SCP-956 has broken free from its containment chamber and is currently roaming the site. Due to the highly aggressive nature of SCP-956's behavior, all personnel must wear Level 4 Hazmat gear at all times whenever interacting with it.</p>
