<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-875</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> </p><p>Operation: All SCP-875 is to be contained in a standard secured aircraft hanger. Air temperature is to be maintained at 75°F with relative humidity at 75%. All work involving SCP-875 is to be conducted in uniformed guard uniforms. A motion sensor has been installed to monitor for unauthorized access to the hanger during routine maintenance. Personnel authorized to interact with SCP-875 must wear flame-retardant coveralls and respirator masks.</p><p>Outdoor experimentation requires written approval from Dr. ██████. No other personnel are to be present when testing occurs outside the facility's hanger.</p><p>All research involving SCP-875 must be carried out in the presence of Agent ████ and two other agents as required by basic safety protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-875 appears to be a pair of twin-engine A-6E Intruder attack planes. SCP-875 displays no anomalous properties when under its own power, but will immediately take off when a pair of propellers are connected to it (See test logs). SCP-875 moves at speeds typically equivalent to those of an aircraft powered solely by a single machine gun. The total scale of SCP-875's propulsion is not currently understood.</p><p>All recorded information regarding the origin and purpose of SCP-875 is as follows:</p><p>Name: ████████ B-28A Bodney NAS</p><p>Serial: ██120463</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> After the initial discovery of SCP-875 in ████,███, Agent ███████ was sent to investigate. When Agent ███████ attempted to inspect the plane, it took off and flew away. All attempts to re-capture SCP-875 have failed. All maintenance performed by Foundation personnel has been successful in keeping SCP-875 in one place for an extended period of time.']</p>
