<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-193</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-193 is to be contained in a standard containment unit, positioned at the Foundation's on-site scientific research facility, Site-██. Any personnel entering SCP-193 during testing are to wear full body armor with radiation blocking capabilities, and are to be entered via a separate entrance. This is to ensure that any exposure between subjects and SCP-193 itself remains negligible.</p><p>No research is to be conducted on SCP-193 in its present form; however, as long as there is a viable hypothesis concerning the nature of its current state, research on it may proceed without incident. Currently, this hypothesis states that SCP-193's anomalous properties manifest when it reaches an unknown mass threshold, at which point it will begin to shift through several increasingly bizarre states before ultimately reaching a final aggregate state for measurement.</p><p>Any personnel who enter SCP-193 during a mass shifting event is to undergo decontamination and be returned to duty immediately following exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-193 is an extradimensional space the interior of which is apparently composed of a massive, black void. Internal dimensions are currently unknown, but appear to be approximately 3 times larger than the space previous measured by Foundation satellites, with a count rate of ████km/s.</p><p>SCP-193 does not appear to be made up of any form of matter that has been observed in this universe; in fact, space exploration has either failed to detect its presence or has resulted in data corruption. It is also highly resistant to physical damage, as any attempt to physically interact with it results in the observer becoming fully demanifest; any physical damage to SCP-193 will instead result in either spatial distortions prior to nuclear annihilation or the formation of new spatial dimensions within SCP-193 itself. The latter effect can be explained via the combined actions of SCP-193 and its users.</p><p>SCP-193's anomalous properties manifest when an object, subject, or organism enters the space bound within it. All subjects entering SCP-193 experience a complete loss of their bodies in their entirety (including their brain activity) and then reappear elsewhere within SCP-193. Any attempts to scan or probe inside SCP-193 from outside will show an empty black void; however, these attempts will always fail due to the fact that such probes simply do not exist within this universe. All experiments involving direct contact with SCP-193 have proven similarly unsuccessful, as all objects and organisms exposed to it instantly demanifest upon contact with it. The only exception to this is testing involving the use of alternate universes and reality splitters.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> History of SCP-193</p><p>SCP-193 was discovered by Foundation agents embedded within the military intelligence agency known as the DIA. The DIA had been tracking a series of disappearances that were occurring within the ranks of their operatives, and began an investigation into the matter in order to determine a cause for these occurrences. The DIA had observed several isolated incidents of this nature from time to time, however, the frequency and severity of these incidents had increased significantly since their discovery of SCP-193.</p><p><strong>On ██/██/███, at ████:</strong>███, Agent █████ entered SCP-193 while participating in a standard security training exercise. He appeared in a room that contained two armed combatants; both were armed with high caliber semi-automatic rifles with undersized ammunition. However, upon reaching for his weapon, Agent █████ was demanifested before he could make contact with any part of his body.</p>
