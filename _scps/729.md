<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-729</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-729 are to be kept in a holding cell at Site-48.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-729 is a phenomenon affecting a group of up to 15 individuals. When within 2 meters of another member, the individual will undergo changes in physical appearance. This includes but not limited to hair color, fashion sense, and "lifestyle."</p><p>SCP-729 was first noted on unknown date in New York City. At this time, its effect had spread across several states and had grown to encompass over thirty individuals.</p><p>An instance of SCP-729 will experience a continuous physical change until it has changed its hair color or wardrobe at least three times each visit to its new location. If it does not do so for a period of three weeks, it will change appearance again.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-729 was involved in an incident on 29/04/2003, where it had been imprisoned by the Foundation. It is believed that at one point, SCP-729 was being held in a jail cell. However, it had been reported to the guards by several of its members as "too high profile."</p><p>On this date, the subject\'s population had increased to over fifty instances. Upon learning of this, guards attempted to reduce the population via force, but were unsuccessful due to their inability to determine how many observers existed.</p><p>As the population within SCP-729 continued to grow and the guards\' attempts failed, they decided to form a plan. Guards gathered together in an attempt to create a large enough group to make SCP-729 infinitely large. After a period of time, this plan had succeeded.</p><p>When the group was large enough for their purpose, the guards created a line of several individuals, who would be unaware of their presence and stand in front of SCP-729. The guards then provided material for them to wear and distributed hair dye throughout the new group. After this time, all members became aware that they were wearing alternate clothing and promptly took it off.']</p>
