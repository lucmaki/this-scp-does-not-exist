<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-537</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-537 is to be kept in a secure containment locker at Site-48's Safe SCP wing. Any personnel entering SCP-537's containment cell must first undergo psychiatric evaluation, after which they may enter the chamber.</p><p>The interior of SCP-537's containment cell should be maintained at −20° Celsius. A supply of warm blankets are to be maintained in the cell at all times. Personnel not familiar with the interior of a cold space habitat should report any unusual symptoms immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-537 is a large steel outer shell with an internal structure that resembles a conventional space habitat. The interior of SCP-537 is completely filled with liquid helium 2 (He) at −235° Celsius, with this temperature able to be changed through the use of a remote control on site. Within the interior of SCP-537 are several large automated machines and what appears to be intelligent robotic lifeforms, referred to as SCP-537-1.</p><p>SCP-537-1 can only be seen following close range artificial lighting by use of LED lamps. All attempts to interface with SCP-537-1 have so far been unsuccessful, and require the inhabitant(s) or their lab coat or uniform which allows full access to their bodies.</p><p>When any human subject enters SCP-537, they will report that they are accompanied by a collection of entities resembling quadrupedal tank crew members, who will act as an escort for the subject's exploration of the interior of SCP-537. These entities display no willingness to enter into conversation with subjects who enter SCP-537.</p><p>When under the effects of alcohol, subjects will describe experiencing hallucinations regarding anomalous tank crew commanders positioned in compartments throughout the interior. These commanders will behave in a manner consistent with humanoid inhabitants; however, they can only be identified as tanks and/or unidentified space vessels from human observation due to their immense size and durability. Upon exiting SCP-537, all subjects report feeling uncomfortable in their own skin due to their self-reported interactions with these "aliens".</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 537-1:</strong></p><p>On the following day, SCP-537 was found to have disappeared from its containment locker. The subject of SCP-537 had entered the containment cell and retrieved SCP-537, after which he/she closed the door to the containment cell. The subject then proceeded to open a hatch leading to the interior of SCP-537, and exited SCP-537 to report a heated exchange with the entities within SCP-537. SCP-537 was recovered shortly thereafter.</p><p>Subject did not describe any interaction with SCP-537-1.']</p>
