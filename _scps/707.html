<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-707</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-707 is to be kept at a maximum area of two (2) square meters, inside a containment chamber measuring two (2) square kilometers. Four (4) armed guards are to be stationed at the entrance to SCP-707's containment chamber. Guards are to carry standard issue pistols and an epinephrine syringe at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-707 is a platform in the shape of a two (2) square meter area. Currently, the platform seems to be unoccupied, but the walls and floor of SCP-707 are opaque, making it impossible to determine if this is an intentional feature or not. The interior of the platform does not contain any physical objects, although there are four (4) large metallic bars stretching across the interior of the platform.</p><p>SCP-707 was discovered when local residents reporting hearing someone screaming. When Foundation agents located the screaming subject, they found him hanging from one of the four metallic bars. The subject was brought to Site 19 for interrogation and was deemed a Level 3/707 situation. The subject was given Class-A amnestics and released outside SCP-707.</p><p>Interview 707-1:</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ██████</p><p>Interviewee: Subject ████ ███</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Dr. ██████: So you're inside SCP-707? What do you know about it?</p><p>Subject: I don't know anything about it! I've been in here for an hour at least, and I haven't seen anything! Why won't you let me out?! What kind of experiment is this?!</p><p>[END LOG]</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 707-1:</strong></p><p>On 04/03/1984, a second subject was discovered inside SCP-707. Subject ████ ██████ was found hanging from the ceiling of SCP-707, with a warning sign tied to his neck. Subject ██████ was given Class-A amnestics and returned to his home.</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Are you alright?</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Yeah, I'm fine. I just didn't expect being here long enough to make me lose my grip.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> What did you see?</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Nothing! I couldn't see anything! It was pitch black!</p><p>[END LOG]</p>
