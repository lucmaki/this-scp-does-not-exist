<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-270</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-270 is to be contained within a standard containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-270 is a Scottish oak tree located in the █████ campus of the University of Glasgow.</p><p>The SCP has a diameter of 20 m and produces one to two fruits annually. SCP-270 removes the wood from these fruits and creates wooden "protest signs", which are hung down its outer limbs. These signs look similar to other protest signs made by spontaneous human combustion victims but have been described to be «spiky». The second use of their wood, they take the form of a more identifiable object like a limb or a head. Intentionally broken a piece of SCP-270's wood will grow back into its original shape within 10 days.</p><p>It is suggested, but not confirmed, that SCP-670 is connected to SCP-270 and may exhibit similar behavior at some point in the future, but additional testing on this matter is prohibited under the current circumstances.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
