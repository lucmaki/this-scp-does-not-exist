<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-235</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-235 is currently in Foundation custody, and is to be held in a standard containment locker at Site-██. Testing of SCP-235 requires advance approval from a level 3 personnel with at least three months of experience acting as a test subject.</p><p>In the event that testing of SCP-235 is warranted, the following guidelines are to be followed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-235 is a small wooden box, 10 cm x 8 cm x 7 cm in size. The lid is of a plain wood, and has only one hole for viewing the contents within. SCP-235 appears to be made from a single piece of wood, although tests have confirmed that it sways slightly when opened.</p><p>When open, SCP-235 will display an old black and white photo measuring 17 cm x 12 cm when not folded or placed on a flat surface. The photo depicts an elderly man with grey hair wearing formal attire. Despite being thirty years old at the time of the photo's creation, the gentleman appears to be well into his seventies or eighties. Both the man and woman appear to be smiling at the camera.</p><p>If the photo is unfolded or allowed to hang freely in a room or hallway, several anomalies will be observed. When unfolded further, the image will show several additions to the original image. These additions are all related to the anomalous properties of SCP-235 itself, and include:</p><p>Alternatively, pressing down on one of four "clapboard" objects in the photo may reveal another addition relevant to SCP-235's properties. referred to as "clapboard effects". These additional images are described below.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addition 1:</strong></p><p>Addition 2:</p><p><strong>Addition 3:</strong></p><p>Addition 4:</p><p><strong>Addition 5:</strong></p><p>When the photo is presented to someone who believes in, or has an interest in, the paranormal, additional anomalous properties will manifest. The person in question will describe the new image as an "artifact", and will not be able to provide a rational explanation for its existence. For instance, a person who believes that ghosts only exist in the present may see an image of a ghost or ghostly figure in the past.</p><p>Upon further examination, it may be possible to determine the date on which the photo was created by referencing other notes found within SCP-235\'s interior. Additionally, clapboard effects will show up on the photo to coincide with the date of the note being discovered within SCP-235\'s interior.']</p>
