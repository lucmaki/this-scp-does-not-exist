<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-455</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-455 is kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-64. SCP-455 is to be given a diet consisting of twenty-seven portions of protein and thirty-one carbohydrates per week. The cell may be opened for feeding only with permission from the on-site head psychologist. A privacy screen around the perimeter of the cell has been installed to prevent observation by unauthorised persons.</p><p>The cell containing SCP-455 is to be under constant video surveillance, and any changes in behaviour are to be reported immediately to the site's senior researcher. Any physical contact between SCP-455 and any objects or walls in the cell must be authorised by two staff members before it takes place. Any objects which SCP-455 does not recognise should be handled with caution, as contact with such objects may cause it discomfort. Staff are to refer to SCP-455 as "object" when speaking to it.</p><p>SCP-455 has not shown signs of emotion, thought, or intelligence since its recovery, although it cannot communicate through physical contact. It has not attempted to escape its cell since initial containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-455 is a human male (identified by fingerprint analysis) approximately two meters tall, with a muscular build. It possesses perfect physical health, including the absence of any scars or blemishes, and has no signs of illness or deformity. SCP-455 exhibits extreme hostility to any person who approaches it, but this is not due to a deficiency in strength. Due to its inability to communicate verbally through physical contact, we are unsure if it possesses any mental abilities beyond this hostility. SCP-455 appears to have entered a state of suspended animation after suffering severe trauma on ██/██/█, although it shows no signs of cognitive damage in this state.</p><p>SCP-455 cannot be reasoned with, only persuaded with rewards and punishments - however, it demonstrates an increased willingness to cooperate if these are presented as part of an experiment. When observing SCP-455 attempt to perform various tasks for research staff, it consistently fails until it has been given the piece of equipment required for said task. SCP-455 does not seem aware that it requires such items in order to complete the task successfully.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 455-1:</strong> SCP-455 is capable of identifying objects by touch, and will reinitiate contact with an object if it is removed from its vicinity. This has been the only way to prevent SCP-455 from attempting to leave its cell.</p><p>We have used an automated system to test SCP-455's strength; this test involved placing a specialised device which subjects all subjects to a maximum of ██ Gs. SCP-455 was able to withstand ██ Gs easily, but did complain of pain during testing.</p>
