<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-425</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Every SCP-425-A instance is to be kept in a standard containment unit at Site-77. All units are to operate on atmospheric pressure, and contain an airlock entry point, placed parallel with the floor. An inverse cubic meter vacuum is to be maintained within the containment area, trapping SCP-425-A inside. All areas containing SCP-425-A instances are to be monitored with video cameras at all times.</p><p>In the event of an SCP-425-A instance leaving its containment area, it is to be apprehended as soon as possible and returned to containment, as well as sublimated through an airlock entry before attaining escape velocity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-425-A is a type of subatomic particle known as a "flavor" or "emergent particle".</p><p>SCP-425-A modifies the properties of any material it comes into contact with, causing changes in the chemical composition and physical form of said materials. These modifications are permanent unless reversed by scientific means, and cause each instance of SCP-425-A to possess unique properties which cannot be reproduced.</p><p>The most common physical property possessed by SCP-425-A is to cause any matter it comes in contact with to shrink until being assimilated into its constituent atoms, after which it will disappear. This property can be duplicated by any material in a vacuum, but only through reverse engineering what was originally produced. Standard testing methods such as tunneling, x-ray imaging, and infrared spectroscopy are ineffective at finding SCP-425-A instances in this state.</p><p>SCP-425-A other than those in gaseous form have been observed to exhibit all manner of anomalous processes dependent upon their density. Some examples include:</p><p>The nature of these anomalous phenomena vary depending on the density and form of SCP-425-A. Most anomalous objects are created through splitting into an appropriate number of particles capable of interacting with one another, but nonmaterial instances may also become sentient or undergo structural changes similar to those of living organisms. Below are some examples:</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 425-1:</strong> History of SCP-425</p><p>SCP-425 was discovered on October 27, 1987 during a routine inspection of an abandoned warehouse in ██████, Italy. A small number of SCP-425 instances were found in the basement, while most of the building was completely devoid of matter.</p><p>A preliminary investigation revealed that the owner of the building had used the basement to house his collection of antique furniture and other items. Upon initial inspection, it was noticed that the items had been replaced with identical copies. When questioned, he claimed to have purchased them from a nearby shop, only to discover later that they were made of SCP-425.</p><p>Further investigation into this shop led to a man named Bruno ████████, who was believed to be responsible for placing an anomalous enchantment upon the items and replacing them with copies. His home was raided by Foundation personnel and a large amount of SCP-425-A instances, anomalous materials, and assorted artwork were confiscated.</p><p>After several days of questioning, ████████ was found dead in his home by agents. Preliminary autopsy investigations showed nothing unusual, but further examination revealed that ████████'s heart had been replaced with an SCP-425 instance and that his lungs had been replaced with an instance of SCP-████. It is speculated that ████████ had been using SCP-425 to remove himself from the world and cease his existence."]</p>
