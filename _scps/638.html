<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-638</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-638 is located in a Standard Containment Locker, at Site-72's Low-Threat Object Storage Shed. SCP-638 may be accessed by personnel with Level 6 clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-638 is a heavy-duty toilet paper dispenser fashioned in the shape of an anthropomorphic species of snail, to which it was originally addressed. The object has not been modified since its initial discovery; it is in perfect condition with no damage or wear of any sort. SCP-638 measures approximately 1.5m tall, 1m in width and 0.8m in depth. SCP-638's shell is constructed primarily of cedar wood, tin and steel. Testing suggests that the object is completely waterproof and impervious to attack; however, at this time, no damage to the object has been discovered and only Level 4 personnel are authorized to be within one (1) metre of SCP-638.</p><p>SCP-638 displays a unique anomalous effect when first inserted into a toilet system; namely, while it appears to function as normal, all bathroom paper should be discarded after use. While various tests have proven that this is indeed how SCP-638 functions, this has not ceased all research efforts for testing purposes. After being used for an extended period of time (approximately 2 hours), or if every available toilet roll is removed from the chamber during use, SCP-638 will expel a wave of ink from its base. The wave will then flow into whatever container or chamber containing the ejected material has been cleared beforehand. This ink will not spread beyond that area and will remain contained within until reinserted into another container or used on another surface that can absorb it; however, the ink itself retains no anomalous properties after coming into contact with any other substance save those specified above.</p><p>Ink released by SCP-638 appears to mimic the same type of ink used on most types of toilet paper, being of identical colouration yet with a highly viscous consistency (however, testing with squishy substances and high viscosity liquids produced results mostly similar to standard toilet paper). A small amount of this ink must be thrown away every 2 hours through normal waste disposal procedures and will float in water until that time comes again.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 638-1:</strong> SCP-638 was recovered from the home of a suicidal man in ██████████████, Canada on 18/04/1997. The man had previously been found in his garage, attempting to set his home ablaze. He had killed his son and daughter prior to this event, and had been suffering from severe psychological distress. He was admitted into the local mental hospital, where SCP-638 was discovered during an inventory check.</p><p>Following its recovery, SCP-638 was kept in the custody of local authorities until further notice; however, due to the fact that it was not immediately classified as a Safe object, it was sent to Site-72 for research purposes.']</p>
