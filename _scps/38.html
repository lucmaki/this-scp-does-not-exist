<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-38</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-38 is an integrated part of the worldwide financial system and efforts to isolate it are mostly irrelevant. The Foundation has the power of financial regulation, but its most effective use seems to be limited to preventing the citizenry from learning about SCP-38's existence. Environmental factors such as specific local economic conditions, climate and demography have been shown to have a significant impact on the credit rating of local institutions.</p><p>The Foundation takes care to ensure that SCP-38 does not gain too much influence over national politics. While SCP-38 is tasked with regulating itself and is overseen by the Bank for International Settlements, any attempts by SCP-38 to reshape national banking policies are resisted by the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-38 is an integrated system of numerous financial institutions, known as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. The BIS was founded in 1930 to administer the gold standard after its collapse during World War II. When an individual or institution seeks debt with a BIS-member entity, SCP-38 automatically assesses their credit worthiness. If the individual or institution is rated as having a sufficient "credit rating", SCP-38 will provide them with a loan of up to 13 times the original balance owed.</p><p>Organizations that are unable to access such loans are denied by SCP-38's automated systems and subject to concerted efforts by Council members and staff at various international banks to bring them into compliance. Individuals who become aware of this process usually notice that their local economy is thriving while national politicians seem powerless to prevent it.</p><p>Most people living in areas where SCP-38 exercises significant influence see this process as an act of providence. However, due to SCP-38's global reach and the normal secrecy surrounding its operations, many have expressed fears about the effects of SCP-38 on local banking systems. Some concerns include:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Information on SCP-38 was brought to the attention of the Foundation by Dr. ████████ at the Bank for International Settlements in early 20██. After an investigation, it was discovered that SCP-38 had been operating at a significant financial loss since the 1930s. The Foundation found that almost all of SCP-38's assets were owned by the BIS and were either managed by or held in trust for various international governmental and banking institutions. The majority of the BIS' assets are held in the form of gold bullion deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, but all of them (excepting its reserves of gold bars) are held in very limited trusts.</p><p>It was also found that most of these assets were ultimately owned by other governments and institutions, several of which were not known to the general public. Only a handful of government institutions and banks outside the US have been known to be aware of SCP-38's existence.</p>
