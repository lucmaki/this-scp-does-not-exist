<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-175</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-175 has been contained as a Safe object in an isolated containment area. A standard security perimeter is to be maintained around the containment area. Containment area access is limited to D-class personnel only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-175 is a collection of three objects: a weed, a flower, and a stump. SCP-175's anomalous properties manifest when spoken or otherwise communicated with.</p><p>SCP-175 may be formed from any leafy, flowering plant. It prefers ground plants that are high in nutritional value, especially seeds (but will take previously used plants).</p><p>SCP-175 will only interact with living creatures who can properly use language to identify themselves. SCP-175 will speak to these creatures on two topics.</p><p>If spoken to, SCP-175 will state its name as "Two Weeds and a Flower", and request that the creature talk about itself. If the subject does not have a self-identifiable name, SCP-175 will ask for a descriptive noun that identifies them uniquely. So far, attempts to deceive SCP-175 have yielded total failure.</p><p>If asked what it's doing there, SCP-175 reports that it was "planted by some fool". Any further requests for information are ignored.</p><p>Entering the area where SCP-175 is located will cause it to disappear instantaneously; it remains in an intangible form until spoken to again. Entering the area again has not been successful yet due to the fact this would be considered willful hindrance of containment procedures by the Foundation personnel currently present in the area. Asking SCP-175 why it doesn't speak causes this effect, but if asked how someone could mistake themselves for an object rather than a person, SCP-175 reiterates that it was planted there by "some fool", citing this as proof.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 175.1:</strong> As of ██/██/████, SCP-175 has been instructed to allow D-class personnel to enter the area with them. No further anomalous effects have occurred.</p>
