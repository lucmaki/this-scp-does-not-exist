<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-236 is the original hand-written manuscript of a 2,900 word essay titled 'The Incredulity of Saint Thomas'. Written in its secondary natural coloration, SCP-236 was discovered by Foundation agents embedded in the Corpus Christi (Texas) city library system in 1989. The original document has been preserved and measures 3.35 m x 1.85 m.</p><p>Analysis has revealed no additional information on the circumstances surrounding SCP-236's discovery but gives an approximate date for when it was written.</p><p>ADDENDUM: On 03/11/2009, SCP-236 underwent a visible change in coloration and texture. The document then returned to its original state within the following five days. This process is currently ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcription of the document.</p><p>The incredulity of Saint Thomas</p><p>By the grace of God, we have been granted a unique opportunity to witness the beliefs of our faith and the workings of its worship. Once, this would have marked a great victory for us, but now it is merely a minor hurdle in our path. And yet, to see the Church\'s arrogance up close is worth all the trouble. To think that their teachings can survive for so long after such a grave incident as the birth of Christ. We need not let this fail.</p><p>Many years ago, I met a man named Edward. We shared a similar upbringing and joined the faith together as teenagers. I was in love with him and he with me, until his whole family were killed in an accident some time later. Edward did not take this well, and was deeply affected by the loss of his family. He was withdrawn and isolated for some time, only speaking to me when he needed something or wanted my company.</p><p>For months at a time, he refused to even acknowledge me in public, and I was forced to respect his wishes while he suffered in silence. I always felt that he blamed me for what happened to his family, but I could do nothing about that and could not give him what he wanted – my attention. But then, things changed.</p><p>Edward started acting more like his old self again and became more friendly than he had been before. He talked about his family less and less and eventually started to show an interest in religion again. When he was ready, Edward asked if he could give an impromptu sermon on faith and I happily agreed.</p><p>He had never given a sermon before, but I thought it would be good if he practiced it and went over a few things before delivering it in front of everyone at Sunday Mass. And so it went. Edward delivered his sermon, covered some points we had discussed previously, and answered a few questions from the congregation afterwards. During one of his pauses between questions, I leaned over to whisper in his ear that I had missed hearing him talk during those months when he was unresponsive to my calls and that I hoped that this would be fixed soon.</p><p>And then he spoke those words:</p><p>"I can\'t believe how big you are."</p><p>And then he left the church with smiles on all of our faces; smiling because of Edward who was happy again for once, not because of me who was upset by what he said. But whatever emotions he may have had at the time have been washed away by the sheer size of his accomplishment. It is truly remarkable that we have achieved what we have, what we have seen; how much better it could have been if Edward had not been so concerned with being right rather than being loved.']</p>
