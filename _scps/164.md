<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-164</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-164 is to be contained within an 8m x 4m x 5 cm reinforced rubber enclosure at Provisional Site-77. A tiny garden of corn and wildflowers is to be maintained around the enclosure, and access should be limited to no more than 2 people at a time. No animal feed of any kind is to be given to SCP-164. Water must be frozen before it reaches the enclosure (no exceptions).</p><p>SCP-164 is to receive a small amount of live mice each day. Since its capture, it has shown a strong aversion to water, making it necessary for SCP-164 water to be frozen prior to entering the enclosure. Human volunteers have been observed to willingly enter the enclosure multiple times a day in order for SCP-164 to lap water from their hands.</p><p>All Foundation personnel are required to undergo extensive psychological evaluation before working with SCP-164 or other arboreal dinosaurs. Personnel who fail psych evaluation are permanently reassigned or terminated by amnestic injection.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-164 is a large, arboreal snakeine mammal from the Late Cretaceous period. It is approximately 10m long. Its body consists of a series of overlapping leathery skin plates that move with it in a sinewy fashion. Remarkably, these skin plates are not armored, instead containing pockets of air and cold blood vessels. SCP-164 has two sets of limbs similar to those of other snakes, and uses them to walk on all fours and even swing between trees.</p><p>SCP-164 is mildly carnivorous, feeding primarily upon Primates and other large mammals, but will also eat small mammals, birds and insects as opportunity may present itself.</p><p>SCP-164 has a strange habit of attempting to adopt the posture of human babies as they fall asleep or as they sleep. In this posture, it will wrap its tail around itself in order to form an arched shape resembling the infant's head. If one attempts to reach over SCP-164 while in this position, the subject will perceive SCP-164's tail as a large quivering limb with a webbing of veins. After being returned to its normal state, SCP-164 will not recall this behavior unless specifically informed of it by personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 164-1:</strong></p><p>SCP-164 was captured in ██████, Brazil, in 2005. During the initial police search for a missing child, SCP-164 was found to be sleeping on a bed of palm leaves. The police were unable to awaken it, and SCP-164 was taken into Foundation custody. It was isolated from other human interaction until its immunity to water was verified.</p><p>During its initial containment, SCP-164 made several attempts to adopt the sleeping posture, constantly becoming agitated when it could not. It is currently undergoing psychological evaluation.']</p>
