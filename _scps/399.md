<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-399</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A non-anomalous wind chaser is to be kept at Site-47. Should the number of anomalous events increase, a Level 3 or higher investigative unit may be sent to verify if the object is indeed to blame.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-399 is a model of a wind chaser, made out of wood to look like a traditional wooden boat. To date, SCP-399 has been found to only have one anomalous property that causes it to not be affected by wind in any way.</p><p>When SCP-399 is mounted in a location with strong wind, it will slowly rotate and tilt as it travels, as if it is attached to an invisible force. When the object is removed from the location of strong wind, the majority of its movement pattern will be restored towards the original position when it was put in the location. It is currently unknown how the anomaly works.</p><p>As of now, three items have been known to have this property: SCP-399 itself, SCP-254 and SCP-5919.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On 7/14/2014, SCP-399 was discovered in the possession of a minor Foundation front company. As SCP-399 does not appear to be anomalous, it was taken back and destroyed.']</p>
