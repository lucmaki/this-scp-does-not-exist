<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-396</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-396 is under observation by security personnel at all times during daylight. Security personnel are to observe SCP-396 and report any changes in the image's composition to the on-site supervisor immediately.</p><p>Any unauthorized persons attempting to view or photograph SCP-396 are to be detained until further notice, preventative measures enacted, and the area reclassified as Euclid.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-396 is an anomalous painting located in the [REDACTED] storage facility at Site-██. The dimensions of the painting are unknown, as it is not directly visible from any position. It is currently believed to be non-anomalous and a replica of an original large oil painting, "Da Picture", by Italian artist █████ ████████.</p><p>SCP-396's appearance shifts constantly (see Observation Log 396), however it does not appear to change with the movement of the observer; when observed from one position it appears normal, but when viewed from another position it appears to have shifted slightly in size or composition. Due to SCP-396's shift in composition, the following procedures are required to prevent harm to personnel or damage to SCP-396:</p><p>Any personnel entering SCP-396 must observe their own reflection on its surface until they leave.</p><p>All personnel attempting to photograph SCP-396 must observe their own reflection on the surface until they leave.</p><p>Personnel who enter SCP-396 must attempt to take mental notes of the composition of all objects in the frame of view, otherwise it will shift and become obscured.</p><p>Due to the intricacy of its composition and changing appearances on different viewing angles, no photographs have been taken successfully since Incident 396-1E. Personnel may only see what is let into view by their vision, likewise all possible reflections are limited by their eyesight (and are likely blurred).</p><p>It is theorized that if enough reflective surfaces were placed within a sufficiently small area that would allow them to see each other's reflections then they would be able to capture this image in a single picture. However it seems that such an object cannot exist without being affected by SCP-396.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 396-1:</strong> On 19/04/██, SCP-396 shifted and became visible from a position previously not visible to any personnel. A camera was immediately brought in and the following images were recorded (see Observation Log 396):</p><p>SCP-396 has continued to display this behavior for the past ██ days, changing composition continuously and becoming visible from completely unexpected positions.</p>
