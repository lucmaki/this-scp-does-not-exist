<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-717</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-717 is currently contained at Site-63, in a Standard Humanoid Containment Cage housing SCP-717. SCP-717 is fed one liter of water per day, and must be prohibited from consuming any food or liquids other than the water provided by Site staff. The water provided must be boiled before use and discarded after use. SCP-717 should be provided with a bed and a chair, and provided with access to a private bathroom with sink.</p><p>In the event that SCP-717 requires medical attention, it should be isolated in its containment cell until healing is complete. Non-vital organs should be removed if necessary in order to keep the body intact and prevent serious damage to the other organs and structures. In cases of infection, contaminated blood samples are to be tested for pathogens, and antibiotic treatments given as necessary.</p><p>During testing, SCP-717 should be given a 1,000 ml saline solution intravenously and anesthetic applied for 1 hour. Testing is to be conducted by Level 2 personnel only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-717 is the corpse of an unidentified male human. SCP-717 appears to be in its early to mid-forties, and has pale skin. SCP-717's body is heavily decayed, with its head and upper torso missing. Remains of clothing remain on the body, including a pair of athletic shorts, a white T-shirt, and gray socks with red borders. SCP-717 possesses no anomalous properties other than being dead. SCP-717 weighs 72.5 kg and is 28 cm in height.</p><p>SCP-717 is unable to decay naturally. If left undisturbed, the remains will eventually decompose into a pile of dust. However, if human intervention is used in order to prevent decay, SCP-717 will regain a more liquid state as time passes. SCP-717's body may then be removed from its skeletal harness and used by any human as desired - using SCP-717 as an experimental device or as part of a weapon is not permitted.</p><p>If any organ within SCP-717 is removed (excluding the brain), it will decay at an accelerated rate, but remain functional and pliable until the removal process has been completed entirely. Removal of one or more organs will cause all other organs to be affected at the same rate - for example, removal of both lungs and the heart can cause loss of kidneys and internal bleeding; removal of only the heart can cause vein failure and blood coagulation, while removal of both lungs can cause choking as blood cannot escape through damaged trachea; removal of only one kidney may render the other unaffected due to redundancy - removing both lungs will have no effect on heart function; etcetera.</p><p>If tissues attached to organs are removed, loss of life leads to complete disappearance from "real world" space - no trace remains that would indicate that anything living ever existed within them once removed. Any structure created within them will similarly vanish when fully taken apart, leaving behind no evidence that such structures ever existed within them in any form or fashion - for example, creating a complete house out of materials stored within a hollowed out tree trunk will immediately vanish after those materials are removed from the original tree. Foundation researchers must follow instructions regarding all objects created during use with SCP-717 - instructions given here do not apply specifically to items made while SCP-717 is working with living tissue as opposed to deceased tissue.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Interview Log 717-1:</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> Good morning, SCP-717.</p><p><strong>SCP-717:</strong> I\'m not 717.</p><p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> Yes, you are. Who is it?</p><p><strong>SCP-717:</strong> Where am I? What\'s happening?</p><p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> You\'re in a facility at Site-63, and you\'re undergoing a treatment to help you stay alive. We\'re going to remove some of your major organs over the next few weeks - we\'re not going to remove any vital ones, but it may help you feel better. Now, we\'re going to ask you a few questions to see if we can determine what\'s done with you or what happened to you while you were alive.</p><p><strong>SCP-717:</strong> Wait… what are you talking about? I haven\'t been alive for a long time. How do you know that?</p><p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> It doesn\'t matter. The important thing is that we can help you live a long time. Now, let\'s get started.</p><p>Agent █████ begins to explain the process of removing organs from SCP-717\'s body.</p><p><strong>SCP-717:</strong> Hang on… how does this work? What happens to me when you do this?</p><p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> It\'s best if we wait until we get through the details of this first.</p><p><strong>SCP-717:</strong> No, I want to know what\'s happening. What happens when you take my heart out?</p><p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> We\'ll tell you when we get to that point in the procedure.</p><p><strong>SCP-717:</strong> Is there an end point? Will I still be alive when this is done? When the procedure is done?</p><p><strong>Agent █████:</strong> Yes, everyone will. Now, try to understand what we\'re doing here…</p><p>After some time, Agent █████ finishes explaining the procedure for removing organs from SCP-717\'s body. Agent █████ begins to explain the process of injecting artificial blood into SCP-717\'s body while performing the organ removal procedure.</p><p><strong>SCP-717:</strong> That\'s worse than I thought it would be… Why do I have to have this stuff injected into me? Why can\'t they just take out my organs like they said they would and put them in a jar somewhere? Why do I have to have them stuck inside my body all the time? Can\'t you just take them out and put them in a jar somewhere? Can\'t you just put them away and forget about me so that I don\'t keep getting hurt all the time? Can\'t you just let me die so that I don\'t keep getting hurt all the time? Can\'t you just kill me like everyone else does and then stop trying to make me live forever so that I don\'t keep getting hurt all the time? Can\'t you kill me and then stop trying to make me live forever so that I don\'t keep getting hurt all the time? Can\'t you… can\'t you just… just… oh god… please… please just do it already! Please! Please! Please! Please! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!?!?!?! WHY CAN\'T YOU JUST DIE AND NOT DO THIS TO ME?!?! WHY CAN\'T YOU JUST STOP TRYING TO MAKE ME LIVE FOREVER?!?! WHY CAN\'T YOU JUST DROP MY KIDNEY AND SAY GOODBYE SO THAT I DON\'T HAVE TO GET HURT ALL THE TIME?!?!?!?!?"']</p>
