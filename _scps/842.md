<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-842</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> D-Class personnel are to be provided with the name "John Lorenz" for use in all Foundation records. D-Class personnel assigned to SCP-842 are to be unarmed and confined within a white room. The walls of the room are to be lined with sound absorption upon request. In addition, any noise coming from outside of the room is to be recorded and logged as anomalous activity. This recording of noise is to be held in secure storage.</p><p>Internal communications within SCP-842's realm are prohibited except through approved protocols. Vegetation below 50 m has been planted around the perimeter of SCP-842's enclosure in an attempt to maintain the illusion that SCP-842 is a living being. As SCP-842 does not respond to external stimulation, its barrier is not considered breached at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-842 is a man, 2.2 m in height, dressed in a suit of questionable quality and a straw hat. SCP-842 does not make any indication of external stimulus, such as light or sun, regardless of the time of day. Its behavior remains the same throughout the year (See Incident Report 842-1), and its voice is greatly altered to reflect this lack of change.</p><p>SCP-842 exhibits no reaction to touch, sound, or stroking. It will not move towards an individual attempting to touch it unless they are previously instructed to do so. If a new individual touches SCP-842 with both hands, it will move towards that individual and attempt to stroke their cheeks with both of its hands repeatedly.</p><p>When questioned about its origins, SCP-842 responds as follows:</p><p>Objects that move outside of SCP-842's area of effect become anomalous and disappear from sight.</p><p>SCP-842 has been contained within its enclosure since 1971, when Foundation agents were tasked with containing the entity for evaluation by Dr. Josephine Galloway at Site-77. D-Class personnel assigned to SCP-842 are required to answer any question posed by Dr. Galloway or her assistants using the name "John Lorenz". SCP-842 responded initially by saying "Lorenz? Who's John Lorenz?" Once directed to specific information on Lorenz, SCP-842 would respond after two minutes with an answer consistent with information already known by Dr. Galloway</p><p>Incident 842-1: On 17/03/1971, Dr. Galloway asked SCP-842 what had happened to him prior to his containment on 07/01/1973. The following exchange occurred:</p><p>Dr. Galloway: "What have you been doing for the last 10 years?"</p><p>SCP-842: "Nothing."</p><p>Dr. Galloway: "Nothing at all? Is that right? Nothing at all?"</p><p>SCP-842: "It would be more accurate to say nothing I could help you with."</p><p>Dr. Galloway: (noticing a note in her hand) "Excuse me?"</p><p>SCP-842: "Every time you tried something like this before I got wind of it, you ran into some sort of problem when [DATA EXPUNGED]."</p><p>Dr. Galloway: (pulling out several papers) "You got wind of what?"</p><p>SCP-842: "Of your plans concerning me."</p><p>Dr. Galloway: (hands over SCP-842's file) "Mr… Lorenz?"</p><p>SCP-842: "Forgive me mister, but who are you and how do we know each other?"</p><p>Dr. Galloway: (handing over her id card) "Sorry sir, but this is all we have on you."</p><p>SCP-842: (reading through the files quickly) "I'm sorry doctor"</p><p>Dr. Galloway: (shaking her head) "Do you want us to go away?"</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 842-1:</strong> On 06/01/1973, Dr. Galloway and her assistants were terminated. When questioned about the scientists\' deaths, SCP-842 stated that it "couldn\'t help them. They had to die."</p><p>SCP-842\'s threat was taken into consideration when it was confirmed that Dr. Galloway was an active member of the Foundation. As such, SCP-842 was transferred to Containment Site-77 and classified as a Euclid entity on 06/02/1973.']</p>
