<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-652</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-652 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber on Site-██. SCP-652 is to be fed sugar syrup and water daily, and a single honeybee is to be released into the chamber once every three (3) weeks.</p><p>As of ██/██/19██, bees are to be released into SCP-652 at the following intervals:</p><p>Once per week for SCP-652-2 and SCP-652-4.</p><p>Once per month for SCP-652-3.</p><p>Once every three (3) years for SCP-652-5.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-652 is a cardboard box measuring 12cm by 12cm by 6.5cm, in which five honeybees (Apis mellifera) have been stored for about one year, starved for forty days, and then killed by freezing. All five were released into the box on ██/██/19██, with the intention of establishing a hive. It has been shown that although the bees are alive, they lack cognitive functions and live solely to fulfill the role of pollination; when food is provided, they will survive indefinitely.</p><p>When SCP-652 is opened, regardless of what time of day or night it is, a single hornet (Vespa mandarinia) will emerge from the box and fly away. If a human presents themselves within ten (10) meters of SCP-652 after it has been opened, an additional hornet will emerge from the box and attempt to sting them on the wrist. The hornet will then proceed to attempt to enter the skin of the subject by piercing it with its stinger; once this succeeds, it will burrow its way into the chest cavity and begin feeding on the blood vessels therein.</p><p>The hornets are initially docile during this process; however, if they are exposed to any form of radiation (such as sunlight), they will aggressively charge towards it, attempting to avoid being hit by it at all costs. It is possible for them to die due to loss of contact with sunlight, but if their stinger makes contact with said radiation, they will resume feeding momentarily before dying out of overexposure.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
