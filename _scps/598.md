<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-598</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-598 is to be contained in a standard Safe containment chamber with a secure soundproofed soundproof chamber attached to the containment chamber. SCP-598 is allowed free reign of its containment chamber.</p><p>When SCP-598 does not show signs of violent behavior, it is to be fed and watered twice per day. SCP-598 is not to receive any other special care. SCP-598 is allowed to transmit its knowledge from time to time.</p><p>Any visiting personnel are prohibited from recording any portion of this document.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-598 is a Caucasian male of indeterminate age, approximately 6.5 feet tall and weighing approximately 150 pounds. SCP-598's skin, eyes and hair are healthy and free of any disease. SCP-598 shows no signs of aging, though DNA tests show that it is not human. SCP-598 appears to possess heightened intelligence.</p><p>SCP-598 has displayed a certain degree of self awareness throughout testing. During the first few hours after its initial containment, SCP-598 demonstrated signs of violent behavior (See Addendum 598A). However, since then SCP-598 has shown no signs of violence or aggressive behavior towards personnel.</p><p>SCP-598 claims to be an atheist and does not believe in any supernatural entities. Despite this, SCP-598 does display knowledge regarding topics such as religion, mythology and science fiction in a manner that seems entirely genuine, though other personnel do not share this belief. While some portions of this knowledge appear accurate, others deviate from reality significantly due to various inconsistencies with current scientific theories and religious doctrine.</p><p>An example of this would be when SCP-598 was put through a series of tests involving the supernatural or metaphysical in order to determine its true nature. In all instances where an inconclusive result could have been produced by the test itself — for instance, where the test failed to detect anomalous structures or phenomena — a completely fictional explanation was provided by SCP-598 in order to prevent an inaccurate conclusion being produced (See Addendum 598B for details).</p><p>Another example: Over the course of several days, multiple attempts were made to determine whether SCP-598 had memorized or practiced any type of martial art — even those not mentioned on their Foundation approved training schedule — using either blunt force trauma or firearms on solid objects. SCP-598 always denied any involvement with martial arts or violence against another sentient being; however no evidence was found as to whether they were telling the truth or not (See Addendum 598C for more information).</p><p>SCP-598 is extremely intelligent and has displayed advanced capabilities at mathematics, linguistics and philosophy over the course of testing but has never shown any advanced understanding of physics or chemistry; despite no known laws governing these sciences existing prior to roughly 3500 BCE (See Addendum 598D for details).</p><p>Although SCP-598 makes no declarations regarding its intelligence level (save for 'not as high as you,' which appears on occasion), it is clear that it possesses extremely great cognitive capabilities and conscious awareness. Despite being unaware of its own nature, it appears to grasp concepts beyond human capability due to its vast storehouse of knowledge. However, some aspects seem entirely inconsistent with accepted concepts of reality; see addendums above.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 598A:</strong> SCP-598's first reaction to being placed in a containment chamber with a door was to destroy the door. The door was later reinforced using reinforced metals and additional reinforced metal sections were added to create additional doors. SCP-598 has not shown any violent behavior since."]</p>
