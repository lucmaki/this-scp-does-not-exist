<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-183</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-183 is currently contained on a Foundation owned research station in the Pacific Ocean, supplied with fresh water, food and professional care. The current object's containment area is to be kept pitch black at all times, with only dim red light being emitted from within the object itself. To maintain a neutral buoyancy, SCP-183 is to be suspended within the containment area using 100 meters of lead fishing line. SCP-183 does not require any mechanism for locomotion.</p><p>No personnel assigned to SCP-183 are permitted to enter its containment area after the change of shift. Only D-class personnel are permitted to handle the object during testing procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-183 is a male, Caucasian, human adult. It weighs 200 kilograms and measures 1.5 meters in length. The largest amount of hair found on the subject's head is 149 centimeters, with a minimum of 72 millimeters removed from the skull. The remainder of SCP-183's body is only covered in a thin layer of epidermis, which continues to grow hair at an extremely slow rate compared to that of its head. The majority of the subject's face and hands are devoid of any skin except for these areas.</p><p>The subject's head (and thus the majority of its mass) appears to be composed primarily of some kind of white, fibrous matter (hairs, feathers or wool), potentially with traces of skin or muscle tissue attached. As such, SCP-183 will produce new hair approximately every 3 hours at a rate that surpasses its natural growth rate. New hair grows at a rate close to its normal rate when suspended in water by itself, but slows down considerably when suspended with lead fishing line. Despite this effect, it still has enough mass to move around freely while suspended in air or water.</p><p>SCP-183 will attempt to consume organic matter within its vicinity when severely distressed. This phenomenon may be triggered through any manner including: severe shocks or intense pain; the instinctual reaction to turn away from a threat; and/or trauma from injury during testing procedures within Foundation custody.</p><p>A fish that can fit inside SCP-183's body has been observed attempting to escape after being "eaten" by SCP-183. These fish appear normal and have not died as a result of SCP-183's attempts. Fishermen who catch SCP-183 will often throw them back into their nets where SCP-183 can either slowly digest their flesh or release them without harm many hours later.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 183.1:</strong></p><p>Discovery: SCP-183 was originally discovered in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico in ██████, Mexico. A fisherman reported finding a large amount of fish rubbery with a "bloody" consistency covered on the beach, after his boat had been overturned by a sudden storm. When Foundation agents arrived on site, they were unable to convince the fisherman to enter SCP-183\'s containment area. After being sedated and then returned to the containment area, the subject was deemed safe for transport and subsequently contained.']</p>
