<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-645</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Non-anomal</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-645 is to be kept in its cell at Site-12. It is to be provided with a diet of non-classified foodstuffs, and regular medical care. The cell is to be covered with a translucent film shielding its interior from direct observation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-645 is a mammal of indeterminate species possibly resembling a raccoon or skunk. It appears to be capable of speech and possesses the intelligence level expected from its size. When kept in captivity, it has shown a tendency to make vocalizations with a tenor similar to that of an adolescent male human, but also with high pitch. The sounds produced by SCP-645 take the form of high-pitched shrieks and squeals.</p><p>SCP-645 is able to navigate through virtually any restricted passage, including locked doors and firewalls. SCP-645 is highly mobile and possesses an acute sense of direction. SCP-645 shows very little restraint against attacking humans, and will aggressively pursue individuals who are infected with SCP-███ if they enter its path. In addition, it demonstrates an ability to grasp objects with its paws in order to throw them at unsuspecting victims.</p><p>SCP-645 also displays polymorphic traits. A number of its traits appear fixed when it's not under observation, while other traits do not manifest until certain conditions are met:</p><p>When examining multiple specimens of SCP-645, several traits will remain constant; see Addendum for additional details.</p><p>Effective Containment of SCP-645 requires:</p><p>Discovery: The first report on SCP-645 came from Site 19 on 3/15/1960. A security officer was passing through an area adjacent to the cafeteria during lunchtime, when he noticed movement near one of the vents near the ceiling. He opened fire on it, but was unable to hit it despite three attempts. Some time later, after some review of security footage, it was discovered that a previously unknown agent of anomalous origin had entered Site 19.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
