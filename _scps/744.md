<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-744</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe (formerly Eucl</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-744-1 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-77. A list of items that are compliant with SCP-744’s properties has been included in the item description.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-744 is a collection of various sheets and pillowcases, bound together by a red, white, and blue decorative ribbon. Eight different patterns have been observed on SCP-744’s surface. The pattern of the ribbon matches that of the item which is being contained. The ribbon can be removed by twisting it in a half-circle.</p><p>Upon exposure to bodily wastes, SCP-744 produces manifestations related to its properties in the form of a total of ███ sentient individuals (SCP-744-1). Said individuals are composed of human waste material, but possess a humanoid appearance. Said individuals are fully capable of coherent speech and of performing basic tasks, such as ordering food at restaurants, attending school classes with other SCP-744-1, or carrying out various household tasks. Each manifestation is able to retain its form for approximately one month before decomposition begins due to leftover nutrients in the body waste material used to produce them.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 744-1:</strong> On ██/██/20██, SCP-744 was brought into Foundation custody after a series of reports were made about the anomalous activities of one ███████ ███████ in the area surrounding Site-77. Prior to that, SCP-744 had been kept in the possession of its previous owner, █████ ████████.</p><p>Interview Log 744-01</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-744-1 #6</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher ██████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following interview was conducted on ██/██/20██, four days after SCP-744 was confiscated.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Rearcher:</strong> What’s your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-744-1 #6:</strong> Phew— Oh, man! I’ve always hated this part. I’m sorry, but I’m not sure if you’re supposed to use my real name. I mean, I’m not famous or anything…</p><p><strong>Rearcher:</strong> What’s your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-744-1 #6:</strong> My name is Mark— Mark ██████. Sorry, I’m sorry. I just really hate this part.</p><p><strong>Rearcher:</strong> I’m not asking for your real name, just your nickname or alias.</p><p><strong>SCP-744-1 #6:</strong> Oh, right. Well, my friends call me “The Human Toilet” because I basically am. My family calls me “The Human Toilet” because they’re all too embarrassed to call me by my real name. It kinda sucks when you live in an apartment with eight other people and they all think you’re a toilet.</p><p><strong>Rearcher:</strong> You said your family has owned this item for many years, correct?</p><p><strong>SCP-744-1 #6:</strong> Yeah, it’s been passed down from generation to generation. My great-grandfather had it when he was alive, and then my grandfather had it at his house for a few years before it got broken and lost. Anyway, when my dad died, my grandma gave it to me because she didn’t want to deal with it anymore and she wasn’t that close with my mom anyways. I guess you could say I inherited the item from her? It all happened a few months ago now…</p><p><strong>Rearcher:</strong> Does anyone else in your family know about the item? Any one other than your grandmother?</p><p><strong>SCP-744-1 #6:</strong> No… just my grandma and myself. I mean, she doesn’t have a lot of friends over here anymore, so most of them don't even know she's still alive. She's pretty lonely… That's why we moved out here to the country… We thought it would be better for her to have a fresh start here than in town where everyone knows her as the old lady who owns a human toilet and can't stop talking about it every time they see her.</p><p><strong>Rearcher:</strong> How do you feel about that?</p><p><strong>SCP-744-1 #6:</strong> I don't like it at all… But what can you do? I mean, it wasn't really my idea to buy this thing in the first place; just my parents and grandma. They wanted to get rid of the thing since it's been in the family for so long… But I really wanted to hold onto this thing because I loved how pretty it looked… And I thought maybe one day I could put some of my hair on there for good luck or something. Or maybe just put it in my room and keep taking good care of it until I go home again. But now that everything's gone to shit— Not just on me but my grandma too— It kind of hurts when all those things started coming true and nobody cared or tried helping us out at all… So yeah… that's how the story goes…</p><p><strong>Rearcher:</strong> Thank you for making the time to talk with us today. Is there anything else you would like to add before we end this interview?</p><p><strong>SCP-744-1 #6:</strong> If there is anything else we need to talk about between now and then… Why don't we pick up where we left off tomorrow? It's okay if we've already talked about everything before, right? Please don't tell anyone about this room or anything about me because… well… You know how sensitive people are about stuff like that! Especially around here at Site 77 where everyone knows everyone else's business! And especially around here with the new security measures the Foundation implements nowadays! It wouldn't be a problem if no one knew about me! Please don't tell anyone about this room! Trust me! We can do this another day if you want! It's okay if you don't want to talk anymore! Just please let this be our secret from everyone else! Please don't ruin everything for me! Please! Just please leave us alone! I promise I'll never bring up this room again… Please don't tell anyone about this room! Please don't tell anyone about this room!!!'"]</p>
