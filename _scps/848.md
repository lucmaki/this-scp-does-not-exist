<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-848</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-848 must be kept in a standard containment locker. Any instances of SCP-848 should be disposed of immediately in a noncombustible manner, as fire would cause another SCP-848 instance to manifest.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-848 is a series of twenty (20) synthetic penises. All instances of SCP-848 are composed of a black substance, which appears to be made primarily out of plastic. Each instance has an inscription on the base of the penis.</p><p>When a human subject makes physical contact with an instance of SCP-848, the inscription will appear in the subject's mind and urge them to "come back to me". After 5-10 minutes involving the subject having visual and auditory hallucinations, the subject will become unconscious and begin vomiting. The subjects body will then spontaneously transmute into a squishy mass resembling that of a human being, with distinct reproductive organs moving around in it's stomach. Subjects will then awaken in various areas across the world, as if they had been transported there by thaumaturgic means. While unconscious, subjects will typically attempt to leave their current location repeatedly before reacting violently towards any living creature from approximately one hour up to 4 hours after awakening.</p><p>Subjects who have been transformed into instances of SCP-848 exhibit no signs of intelligence; instead, they focus exclusively on mating with other creatures regardless of species or gender. When given enough time without being eaten or sexually assaulted, subjects will form rudimentary societies based on their area. These societies will typically try to do whatever they can to keep their members alive through hunting and gathering while attempting to avoid contact with other groups around them.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 848-1:</strong> On 10/27/2017, a Foundation research team was sent to investigate the newly discovered town of [REDACTED], located in the state of [REDACTED]. When the team arrived at the town, they were approached by a man who claimed to be the mayor of the town. The following interview was recorded.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ██████</p><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Mayor ██████████</p><p><BEGIN TRANSCRIPT></p><p><INTERVIEWER EXAMINES MAIN MAINTAINER OF RECORDS OF THE TOWN. MANIFEST YET LACKS CLEAR SHOES DESCRIPTION. PENIS IS NOTICED TO BE OF A PRETTY UNUSUAL SIZE. INTERVIEWER: ANY IDEA WHY HE\'S NOT WEARING SHOES? MANIFEST: DON\'IT CARE, I\'M JUST MAKING SOME HISTORY HERE.></p><p><INTERVIEWEE STARTS SPEAKING, SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE MANIFEST. MANIFEST CONTINUES TO GESTURE AROUND THE ROOM AND NOTES THE SPARRING GEAR HE\'S LOOKING AT, MOMENTS LATER QUESTIONING HOW IT DOES WHAT IT DOES<MANIFEST IS INTERVIEWER\'S PROTAGONIST FOR THIS SECTION OF THE INTERVIEW>. INTERVIEWEE CONTINUES MAKING CONFUSION OF MANIFEST\'S CHOICES OF WORDS OR SIMILAR. MANIFEST: UH, "I-TICK-PICK". WASN\'T MEANT TO BE A JOKE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT\'S LIKE A PUNCH-DOG; IT\'S A GOOD DOG! HAVE YOU MET MY DOG? <INTERVIEWEE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING OFF IN THE MANIFEST\'S COMMENTS…> HEY, DO YOU SEE THAT FIRE? ME AND MY DOG ALWAYS GO OVER THERE AND MAKE SOME BURNING! IT\'S AWESOME! OH, AND I WANTED TO GET ME SOME MORE ARTWORK FOR THE STORE, BUT THOSE GUYS THINK THEY OWN EVERYTHING… THEY DON\'T EVEN HAVE BAD ART! IT\'S SO BORING! I CAN\'T BELIEVE I SAVED THEM FROM THAT DAMN VIRUS! THEY\'RE JUST HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO LIE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO AND THINK THEIR WALLS ARE SAFE.<END TRANSCRIPT></p><p><END OF INTERVIEW></p><p>DUN DUN DUUUUNNNNNN<END TRANSCRIPT>']</p>
