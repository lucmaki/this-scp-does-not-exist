<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-809</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has purchased the building housing SCP-809. The property is to be kept in a locked state and no one is to enter without express permission from the owner of the property. SCP-809-1 is currently being stored in containment locker 809-2 at Site-88.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-809 is an area of ████████ owned by the Foundation. The building is located across from a large park and has been owned by the Foundation since the 1920s, when the Foundation took over maintenance of all anomalous properties in ████████. SCP-809 was constructed during this time and contains various anomalous components.</p><p>SCP-809-1 (also known as "Pocket") is a creature that cannot be classified into any existing taxonomic categories. SCP-809-1 is a being of humanoid appearance with white hair, purple eyes, and green skin, about 1 meter tall. It displays period body armor for arms and legs, though it does not possess any other armor or clothing. SCP-809-1 does not display physiologically human movement or flexibility; however, it can easily traverse rough surfaces and climb up trees. Additionally there are hundreds of pockets on its skin and clothing, making it impossible to determine the number of individuals that make part of SCP-809-1's composition.</p><p>SCP-809-1 communicates mainly through smell. When communication between SCP-809-1 and humans is attempted, words are emitted from pockets at random intervals. Attempting to have SCP-809-1 perform a task that would benefit humans will result in increased activity within its pockets, which causes mild discomfort among SCP-809-1.</p><p>SCP-809 was originally discovered after a young child named Makin found a large pile of dirty rags while playing outside in ████████ Park. Upon further investigation, Foundation agents confirmed the existence of an anomalous entity inhabiting the structure. Due to Makin's memory loss as a result of [DATA EXPUNGED], her mother was unable to explain how she came across SCP-809 or identify more information regarding it. At that point, containment protocols were enacted and standard procedures for dealing with SCP objects were followed.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 809-1:</strong> SCP-809-1's appearance is mainly consistent, with minor alterations occurring in its hair color, skin tone and patterns, and the shape of various pockets."]</p>
