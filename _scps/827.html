<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-827</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> While away from the ocean, SCP-827 is to be kept indoors in a large and heavily reinforced tank. Two armed guards are to be stationed outside the tank at all times. Should the tank be moved, the guards are to remain and replace it at the location nearest SCP-827's current position.</p><p>If SCP-827 tries to leave the confines of its containment area, or if it breaches containment, all Foundation personnel on-site are to be terminated immediately, as well as any civilians nearby. Any and all media capturing SCP-827 are to be destroyed once they have been cataloged.</p><p>Should SCP-827 ever penetrate into ocean water, it is to be attacked by all naval forces present. Non-military air forces are not to engage in hostilities with SCP-827 unless otherwise ordered by O Council.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-827 is a large ocean-going ship approximately 120 miles long, with a crew of approximately 500. SCP-827's exterior is covered in a reflective silver paint, while the interior is lined with gold paint.</p><p>SCP-827 displays several anomalous properties. In addition to its size, it possesses a tremendous amount of mass at a speed of 328 mph, and has no related magnetic field or water resistance. It will even attack hostile ships both on and outside of the water. It also possesses immense strength, able to easily tear through iron chains and crush any ship weaker than itself (although small enough to fit inside SCP-827's hull.) Due to these properties, SCP-827 has been classified as dangerous.</p><p>While on duty, SCP-827's crew members have displayed highly unusual personalities. They often claim to be married (despite no records indicating this) and have consistent opinions on things such as politics, economics and religion. They are also aggressive towards anyone who opposes their ideals, particularly anti-immigration authorities.</p><p>After numerous reports from coast guards, marine rescue agencies, and other first responders, the Foundation was notified of SCP-827's presence on December 10th 2014. SCP-827 was located off the coast of Newfoundland after arriving via iceberg during high winds. After Foundation forces blocked off the entrance to Scintilla Bay in Stellarton Bay, Site 9█ intercepted an audio transmission between ████████████ Company, who were responsible for stopping SCP-827 from reaching Newfoundland waters, and ███████ Company, who were shipping SCP-827 up northward toward █████████████. Following these transmissions was a recording by █████ ██████████ (a spokesperson for ████████████ Company) claiming that they had been sailing away from land in order to circumvent their orders not to do so. The cargo manifest was then broadcast over all Foundation channels.</p>

It is not known whether this was successful or not.</p>
