<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-646</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-646 is to be kept in a secure, temperature and humidity controlled area, guarded by at least two (2) level-2 security personnel. Any outside handling of this item should be accompanied by at least three (3) level-2 security personnel.</p><p>Until a civilian is trained to become familiar with SCP-646's behavior, or until a natural rainstorm allows SCP-646 to be further studied, no testing is to take place involving this object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-646 is a mass of tightly bound, mostly twiggy branches, with a diameter exceeding ten (10) meters. The precise number of branches and their dimensions are subject to change.</p><p>The exact origin of SCP-646's branches is unknown; they have retained traces of previous leaves and bark, but there is also no discernible difference between the species from which the original 'stem' was cut and the current mass. The base of SCP-646 appears to be located in the middle of a forest clearing, although at least one growth has been observed approximately twenty meters above ground level.</p><p>When present in a location where there is sufficient humidity, SCP-646 will begin to secrete a clear liquid (see Experiment 604-1). This liquid, called 'honey', contains various artificial sweeteners alongside small amounts of other non-caloric substances.</p><p>Approximately every two (2) weeks, while active, SCP-646 will produce an overabundance of honey in its entirety. At this time, large quantities of pollen will begin to fall from the substance's 'breathing pores'. Observation has shown that, as it drops off, some pollen will adhere to SCP-646's surface and remain suspended indefinitely.</p><p>The effects observed for this object are based on the type of pollen included in its 'honey'. All types curve outwards rather than remaining within it but still retain their round shape; however, since their original dimensions were between 0.5 and 1Â cm in diameter, they appear rather large when viewed from normal distances. These pollen types are not limited to these dimensions: further testing has determined that each pollen type retains its respective characteristics even at an apparent scale approaching infinity.</p><p>It is possible for any individual who becomes familiar with SCP-646's appearance and behavior to perceive it as a single entity despite its variable nature (see Experiment 604-3). When viewed by observers unfamiliar with its properties or behavior, attempts to gather this entity into a single shape or use it as a model result in the associated objects retaining their individual identities but applying those shape variations seen in SCP-646 across all combinations (see note 2). In addition to the standard honey coloration dependent on pollen type, each observer presents a different pheromone signature seen reflected by the same affected object depending on his personal scent profile; thus any attempt at impersonating SCP-646's mass results in each observer receiving different impressions depending on his personal chemistry. Research indicates that this mimicking effect is felt with every individual who becomes familiar with SCP-646's general details including context and movements relative to observers; however, unauthorized attempts at impersonating it do not induce any anomalous effects (see note 3). According to researchers observing subjects interacting with both instances of SCP-647, subjects seem unaware that they are experiencing separate instances (see note 4).</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-646\'s current appearance is based on its most recent growth, which was observed approximately one month ago. After this growth, it has produced a quantity of honey which has not been confirmed through the use of photography nor chemical analysis. However, both tests are currently impossible due to SCP-646\'s continued anomalous properties. Note that the \'honey\' produced by SCP-646 still retains some of the original pollen shape impressions; however, the pollen itself appears to be different in coloration.</p><p>Experiment 604-1 - Scent recognition</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> D-Class D-4511 was instructed to take a sample from SCP-646 and then to use an aerosol dispenser to spray it into a general area designated as SCP-636. A total of nine (9) D-class personnel were then instructed to walk through the room where D-4511 had sprayed the sample and answer questions regarding its source.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> D-4511\'s sample was identified as being "apple" in nature, with the other personnel identifying it as being "apple" in nature as well. All personnel reported seeing a single entity containing all nine (9) responses; however, when asked if they believed this entity was present when they entered the room, all personnel answered \'no\'.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This experiment was performed without any other influence or testing being conducted on either SCP-636 or SCP-646.']</p>
