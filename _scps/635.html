<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-635</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-635 is to be kept in a locked glass case, secured with a guard and a tight lid. The item should not be opened except by personnel with level 4 clearance and the necessary permits. Experiments using SCP-635 require the approval of Dr. Kareman.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-635 is a small glass vial containing the dried head of a human female (designated SCP-635-1), now believed to be deceased. The vial has been sealed for approximately 200 years, and contains approximately 50% water.</p><p>SCP-635-1's head will move when exposed to physical or chemical stimulation, producing speech. The movements are limited to the jaw, tongue, lips, and cheeks.</p><p>Users of SCP-635 describe SCP-635-1 as having died violent deaths in its youth; a number of injuries have been noted on the body, consistent with a beating or stabbing. Most notably, SCP-635-1's left eye appears to be missing completely.</p><p>When touched by a living human subject, SCP-635 will cause mild irritation over a period of 1 hour; loss of feeling occurs if the object is not moved somewhat. If the subject is wearing sunglasses at the time, this sensation will continue until the sunglasses are removed.</p><p>SCP-635 can be used to speak to humans directly, although all conversation directed at it will only be understood by other humans who have also held SCP-635 for at least 15 minutes. All words spoken by SCP-635 (including any quoted dialog) are in English and in the voice of SCP-635-1.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/20██, SCP-635 was found in a science classroom at [REDACTED] High School. The item was recovered with the aid of [DATA REDACTED].</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Dr. Kareman (Foundation Agent, Level 4)</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Kareman</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Dr. Kareman:</strong> Hello, here's your drug.</p><p><strong>SCP-635:</strong> You do not have permission to use me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Kareman:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were so thirsty for rights. I'll put you down now.</p><p>Dr. Kareman attempts to look into the head of SCP-635, but is unable to see past the upper lip and lower jaw. He requests that a Foundation subject be brought in to allow him to speak to the object directly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Kareman:</strong> So, who are you? What's your name? And why did they do this to you?</p><p><strong>SCP-635:</strong> I am not a person, Dr. Kareman. I am a human head, classified as SCP-635-1. I was used as a test specimen for various forms of drug delivery during my life. At some point, after being trapped in this bottle for over 200 years, I lost consciousness and died.</p><p><strong>Dr. Kareman:</strong> Well, that's a little tragic for someone who used to be alive. Do you mind if I ask how you died?</p><p><strong>SCP-635:</strong> My eye was removed by persons unknown in order to make me more difficult to dispose of than others who had been subjected to similar circumstances.</p><p><strong>Dr. Karemen:</strong> Oh, that sounds horrible! Why would anyone do that?</p><p><strong>SCP-635:</strong> There are many rumors about this practice existing at some time or another in our culture; many of these are funded by those who profit from such information being suppressed. I cannot go into further detail at this time, but I can assure you that my eye was cut out by people who were more than willing to kill me to make it happen.</p><p><strong>Dr. Kareman:</strong> That's terrible! Anyone who would do something like that deserves what they get, right?</p><p><strong>SCP-635:</strong> Yes, they do.</p><p><strong>Dr. Kareman:</strong> Well, thanks for telling me all about it! I'll be sure to write up everything you said in my report!</p><p>[END LOG]</p>
