<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-880</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-880 is to be contained in a cell at a regular Foundation prison facility. No staff other than the warden may enter SCP-880’s cell, except for testing personnel.</p><p>Due to the nature of SCP-880’s anomaly, its existence is to be denied to the general public by a Foundation disinformation campaign, known as Operation: Hijinks.</p><p>SCP-880’s cell is 4m x 4m in size. It contains only a bed. A wall of carbonite is installed on one end for physical containment. The door also has two layers of carbonite sealed on it, serving as an additional barrier from suicide attempts. During testing, no more than 2D-3F of waste products are released per day; assuming this holds true, this would provide adequate cover for the guards and prisoners to maintain the illusion of the cell being filled with human waste.</p><p>SCP-880 does not require any sleep, nor does it age or need food. However, it is expected that SCP-880 will eventually suffer from depression unless it receives regular mental stimulation from the staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-880 is a humanoid entity, 1.7m tall, weighing 75kg. It displays no visible signs of aging or deterioration over the decades it has been held in Foundation custody, despite being originally recovered at age 17. It was capable of successful speech until its incarceration; it did not speak to any staff and refused to communicate with other inmates, but did communicate with itself as well as other non-human entities. SCP-880 is agnostic and displays no interest in religion, philosophy or science and finds the concept of a conscious afterlife to be distasteful.</p><p>SCP-880 is indestructible, and can withstand temperatures ranging from −257°C to 572°C without sustaining damage. The only known means of destruction is incineration at temperatures higher than 572°C, which will result in total destruction of the body; however, this does not alter the mind or personality of SCP-880.</p><p>SCP-880’s anomalous effects do not become active until it is placed within an enclosed space with air, as explained below.</p><p>If all of the air in an enclosed space containing SCP-880 is then completely removed (e.g., via incineration), SCP-880 will enter a state of extreme aggression. The only known means of defeating SCP-880's aggression is the manual destruction of all oxygen in the area where it is present, so that no particles are left for SCP-880’s consciousness to interact with. However, this means that SCP-880 loses all its intelligence and cannot respond to verbal instructions or communication attempts unless it is "vitalised" by the previous removal of air from its location.</p><p>In addition to its aggressive nature, SCP-880 displays immunity to pain and trauma inflicted upon itself; this immunity provides no protection against damage to other objects unless they share SCP-880’s same immunity property, making physical containment impossible except by destroying oxygen molecules themselves. Due to this liability in standard containment procedures, several methods have been devised to allow limited escape for SCP personnel during testing sessions — these methods are summarised below:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> A log of SCP-880’s physical changes over the years is as follows:</p><p>1962</p><p>SCP-880 was captured and held in a facility in ██████, where it was kept in a small cell with one other prisoner. The air within the cell was fully vented annually, but the two prisoners did not interact until the following year.</p><p>1963</p><p>Over the course of 1963, SCP-880 attempted suicide more than once, but was unsuccessful. It was also noted that during this time period, SCP-880 displayed an ability to age rock formations and clay mounds in the prison grounds.</p><p>1964</p><p>In 1964, SCP-880 attempted to escape its cell for the first time. It vanished from its cell and was not found again until a guard found its remains lying motionless in a stairwell.</p><p>1965</p><p>In 1965, SCP-880 began sapping the strength of other inmates, who would later collapse and be taken to the hospital; if SCP-880 was not already in its cell at the time, it would have become stressed over administering such treatment to others. After several months of this practice, the warden confronted SCP-880 about it and asked it how it had gained such power over others. SCP-880 told him that it had "learned" what he thought were "spells." This continued until SCP-880 exhausted itself and collapsed. SCP personnel were able to revive SCP-880 and took it to [REDACTED], whereupon it was returned to Foundation custody.</p>
