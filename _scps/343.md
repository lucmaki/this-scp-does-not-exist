<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-343</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-342 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell located in Site-21's Containment Wing. All interactions with SCP-342 are to take place via video feed, and all personnel interacting with SCP-342 are to wear ear protection during interaction sessions.</p><p>Any personnel attempting to escape the containment facility are to be terminated immediately by security forces and their bodies are to be consumed by SCP-342. If a D-Class is to undergo this procedure, two guards must be present for each D-Class showing symptoms of disorientation due to the consumption of an additional human body.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-342 is a humanoid entity possessing primarily avian traits. It possesses a torso, two arms, and two wings, each of which terminates in three digits. SCP-342's skin appears to be vitrified due to its appearance and shape, as well as its resistance to most forms of damage. SCP-342 is capable of moving and behaving as an ambulatory human, though it has demonstrated some difficulty in performing basic tasks requiring opposable thumbs.</p><p>SCP-342's skin also has some degree of elasticity, allowing it to stretch, bend, twist and ball into a thin membrane layer (see attached photo). This membrane is located underneath the outer layer of SCP-342's body following the removal of the fleshy layer. SCP-342 will become more resistant to damage if the membrane is present, though it can still be broken in sufficient force or by high temperatures (such as being placed inside a furnace or dropped into boiling water).</p><p>The membrane also appears to act as an additional protective layer in addition to its elasticity; fire cannot penetrate the membrane without significant force while sterilization chemicals have little effect on the membrane. Heat resistance is not limited to its own body; if another object is heated through contact with SCP-342's membrane then this heat can pass through and affect any object it comes in contact with up to a distance of 3 meters.</p><p>SCP-342 was recovered during an operation conducted by MTF Lambda-10 ("Birdwatchers") on 12/12/2004 after reports surfaced that several birds had been seen flying towards a nuclear power plant located at ████████████, Nebraska and attacking humans inside surrounding areas. Before arriving on site, Lambda-10 personnel observed several similar instances of SCP-342 near a nuclear power station in ████████, Arkansas.</p><p>Following an initial investigation which included interviewing witnesses who had witnessed SCP-342's flight patterns before their disappearance, Lambda-10 discovered that it was attracted to large crowds of people within a 5 km radius of nuclear reactors and attacked those involved in any way with the movement of these facilities from the east coast side of the United States (see Incident Report 342-01).</p><p>Additional information concerning its attacks can be found under File 342-███.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-342 was first discovered on ██/01/2001, when a Foundation agent was sent to investigate a possible anomaly near ███████. Upon reaching the object, he reported that he could see a route through it. A radio transmission to Mobile Task Force Epsilon-7 (Mobile Task Force Omicron-7) was attempted; however, the signal was blocked by an unknown factor.</p><p>The following objects were observed traversing SCP-342 between the dates noted in brackets:']</p>
