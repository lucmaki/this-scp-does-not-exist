<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-928</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has publicly confirmed containment of SCP-928-1. The local police department is working with the Foundation to protect civilians from SCP-928-2, and is to prevent any repeat occurrences.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-928 is a phenomenon involving the spontaneous appearance of regular billboards at least once every 20 days in rural areas of Massachusetts. The billboards have consistently been composed of computer graphics, and display no text. They bear the image of a blue cat with black strips resembling whiskers, and animate to display various advertising slogans.</p><p>SCP-928-1 is an anomaly relating to SCP-928. If SCP-928-2 is seen by a human subject before midnight, they will see SCP-928-1 (and SCP-928-1 will not exist beyond that time period). Most notable are advertisements for "a brand new kind of cat food", though no such product has ever been found or produced by a third party. It has also been observed appearing during violent weather events and other times considered to be high stress levels in humans. The advertisements appear mostly authoritative in tone, ascribing all signs of danger to "the cat". Humans who see the billboard will feel their body tense up after viewing it, even if it causes no injury or harm.</p><p>As far as is known, the advertisements have never appeared online or on television; however, many people claim to have seen the advertisements through social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These accounts have all been verified to belong to non-anomalous individuals, but some subjects claim that they are being followed by someone impersonating them. The Foundation has begun investigating these claims.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
