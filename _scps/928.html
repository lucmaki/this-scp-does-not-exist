<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-928</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has publicly confirmed containment of SCP-928-1. The local police department is working with the Foundation to protect civilians from SCP-928-2, and is to prevent any repeat occurrences.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-928 is a phenomenon involving the spontaneous appearance of regular billboards at least once every 20 days in rural areas of Massachusetts. The billboards have consistently been composed of computer graphics, and display no text. They bear the image of a blue cat with black strips resembling whiskers, and animate to display various advertising slogans.</p><p>SCP-928-1 is an anomaly relating to SCP-928. If SCP-928-2 is seen by a human subject before midnight, they will see SCP-928-1 (and SCP-928-1 will not exist beyond that time period). Most notable are advertisements for "a brand new kind of cat food", though no such product has ever been found or produced by a third party. It has also been observed appearing during violent weather events and other times considered to be high stress levels in humans. The advertisements appear mostly authoritative in tone, ascribing all signs of danger to "the cat". Humans who see the billboard will feel their body tense up after viewing it, even if it causes no injury or harm.</p><p>As far as is known, the advertisements have never appeared online or on television; however, many people claim to have seen the advertisements through social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These accounts have all been verified to belong to non-anomalous individuals, but some subjects claim that they are being followed by someone impersonating them. The Foundation has begun investigating these claims.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 928-1:</strong> In order to reduce the risk of civilian casualties, the Foundation has been working with local authorities to attempt to prevent SCP-928-2 from affecting those who may not be aware of its existence. Originally, these attempts were made by planting a false advertisement for "a brand new kind of cat food" in areas likely to be affected. The Foundation has since discovered that SCP-928-2 will not appear if the subject is alerted to its presence beforehand, and as such containment efforts have been expanded to include a public awareness campaign involving the local police department.']</p>
