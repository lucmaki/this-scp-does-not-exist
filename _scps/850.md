<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-850</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-850 is to be contained within a soundproofed room measuring two meters in length and one meter in height under surveillance at all times. This room is to be monitored by two (2) Level 3 personnel for any signs of human life within or approaching the room. These personnel may not engage in conversation, attempt to reduce noise from outside the room, or perform any actions that would disturb SCP-850's sleep. Any breach in containment will be met with immediate termination of the subject(s). Subjects are allowed to speak as they see fit, but they are not to be permitted to enter areas that contain known threats of death.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-850 is a human male approximately twenty years old, approximately one hundred and ninety centimeters in height. SCP-850 has been resting in this containment room for approximately eighteen (18) months. SCP-850's eyes are bloodshot, his skin is growing pale, and he appears to be suffering from malnutrition and stress. SCP-850 does not appear to possess any of the standard human senses.</p><p>SCP-850 is able to make itself wake up at any time within forty-five minutes of being asleep. In addition, SCP-850 has no knowledge of when it sleeps for the first time during the night. Despite this apparent self-awareness, SCP-850 often claims that there are certain events in its life that it cannot remember. SCP-850 also has a compulsive need to sleep every night from 2:45AM to 7:45AM while remaining awake during the night.</p><p>While asleep, SCP-850 appears to experience symptoms consistent with narcolepsy. It will fall unconscious after a period of thirty minutes or less, often due to exhaustion. Upon waking up, it will describe fictional events or events that have yet transpired but will not remember them as they occur. These delusions include feelings of being watched by spirits that seem to be trying to protect them and making them feel safe; feeling fear at the fact that they are alone; and being infected with deadly viruses or bacteria upon waking up. SCP-850 will claim that these beings are attempting to prevent him from leaving his room through various means such as throwing objects and blocking doors in the hallway between their room and the hallway outside their room. These delusions are believed to be part of a delusion disorder similar to schizophrenia because of the lack of hallucinations other than those related to infection, which rarely last beyond ten days after waking up from an episode. However, when speaking about these delusions with third parties, SCP-850 claims that these delusions only occur while sleeping; therefore, it does not experience them during the day outside its sleep cycle.</p><p>Despite claiming to have no memory of these incidents once awakened, these same symptoms usually manifest a week after the previous event has occurred and continue until either the subject dies or the virus or bacteria spreads throughout society (See Document 850-1). These symptoms seem to be part of an infectious disease that mimics narcolepsy, but otherwise acts independently of narcolepsy in all other aspects (See Document 850-2). When infected by this disease, the person will pop at regular intervals throughout their sleep cycle within twenty percent of their normal sleeping time. Should another sleep cycle begin before twenty percent of sleeping time is used, then another 'pops' will occur in their next sleeping cycle; this continues on for a total number of iterations equal to how long they slept during that iteration multiplied by 0.2. A person can also contract this disease if they were exposed to it while awake before going into a sleep cycle; however they do not succumb immediately unless they go into a sleep cycle within twenty percent of their normal sleeping time or recent exposure level if they go into a sleep cycle within twenty percent short of their average sleeping time throughout the entire week preceding infection (See Document 850-3).</p><p>Theoretically speaking, infection can go unnoticed by subjects until such time as they sleep for fifteen consecutive nights without going into another sleep cycle or two earlier than usual as well as acquiring DDD/NREM type insomnia without any planned activity outside their sleep cycles during those nights (See Document 850-4). Despite this theory there are no known cases in which this could happen as much as ten years apart due to naturally occurring infections having spread over such a large amount of time that would have interfered with such an occurrence happening naturally without intervention from man (See Document 850-5).</p><p>Document 850-1: The initial document was written by Dr. ████████ following observation on 09/01/1993 through 09/10/1993 where ██ infected individuals died from what appeared to be lingering symptoms after infection occurred approximately four months after infection occurred while ██ individuals remained completely unaffected throughout that entire duration despite being exposed to infectors at close proximity prior to becoming infected (see Document 850-6). It was discovered through later research that ██ subjects had visited several doctors at minimum two or three times every single day over an extended period before becoming infected including healthcare workers at [REDACTED] Clinic which allowed four additional individuals with minor symptoms who had never been near any infected individuals attending doctor appointments instead of directly visiting doctors only once every few days while attending doctor appointments while showing minor symptoms resulting in death but not known if all patients were affected by this before becoming infected because all had been treated for something else causing death within days instead of weeks beforehand before [REDACTED] became aware of what was occurring due to surveillance systems installed following Incident [REDACTED]. This chance resulted in ██ deaths among seventy -nine patients previously treated for minor illnesses resulting in complications not expected under casual observation affecting ██ - ███ individuals previously treated for minor illnesses resulting in death after five - eight weeks following initial marked increase in symptom severity on 08/20/1994 suggesting post incident development through natural progression using established medical reports reported by those infected and mentionable individuals who were infected but not counted due largely to occurrence possible due surveillance failure accidentally caught caused by Drs ████████ & ████████ having many different prescriptions taken over many years resulting in death on [REDACTED] when report should have been buried ages ago resulting in loss significant number potential hostages including subjects who died likely due </p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 850-1:</strong> The following is a list of notable cases of SCP-850 infection that have been recorded. Notable individuals are those who have been recognized by the public as 'celebrities' or 'influential persons' due to their status and fame, such as politicians, artists, musicians, and journalists. All notable cases are listed in order of when they were infected. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but only to give a general idea of the pattern of infection for this species."]</p>
