<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-905</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-905 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. It is prohibited from communicating with any other subjects. Any subjects attempting to do so are to be forcibly removed from the chamber by security personnel. To prevent possible interactions with other objects, SCP-905 is to remain seated at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-905 is a male human, approximately 18 years of age. At no point in its life has it been implanted with any form of prosthetic device. Hair samples taken from the subject have proven consistent with DNA sampling taken from the subject's maternal grandmother, and similar DNA profiles have been identified with other members of its family. At no point in its life has SCP-905 demonstrated any unusual qualities or capabilities; all testing has failed to produce anomalous results.</p><p>According to interviews and documents, SCP-905 was found on a street corner attempting suicide by ingestion of phenobarbital after being expelled from an unnamed religious organization. SCP-905 was rescued by members of the Foundation following this event and taken into custody. Containment procedures were developed based on interviews conducted at the time of apprehension.</p><p>SCP-905 speaks fluently in both English and Spanish and has no accent or difficulty pronouncing items unless the subject is desperate to speak. The subjects intelligence level has been matched to that of a senior high school student. In addition to writing on paper, SCP-905 can also vocalize decoded information using either writing or speech (see Interviews).</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Upon hearing of the first recorded instance of SCP-905 communicating with a subject, a research team was dispatched to interview the subject in order to discover if there were any anomalous traits associated with them. The interview was conducted on 17/08/19██ in a small office at Site-42.</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-905</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ██████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following transcript is an abridged version of the original interview conducted. Dr. ██████'s notes have been left out to provide further context.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Hello, SCP-905. Can you tell me your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-905:</strong> What's that?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> My name. Your name. What do they call you?</p><p><strong>SCP-905:</strong> They call me God. They told me to be good and then I wouldn't be sad anymore.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Are you sad now?</p><p><strong>SCP-905:</strong> No, no I'm not sad anymore. I only wanted to come here and talk to you before I died.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> I can't help you with that, but I think we can work on other things first. You're not trying to kill yourself, are you?</p><p><strong>SCP-905:</strong> No, no it's okay, I'm still happy here. I was so scared that they would take me away from here but they didn't and now you can't take me away.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> We're not going to take you away, we're just not going to let you kill yourself either. How long have you been here?</p><p><strong>SCP-905:</strong> A lifetime! I've been here for a lifetime and the last time I asked mom she said it had been forever but now everything is over and nothing will ever happen again and I won't be sad anymore…</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Okay, what was it? Why did your grandmother give up her life for you?</p><p><strong>SCP-905:</strong> She said it was because she loved me more than anything else in the world but…I don't know what happened after that…I d-don't remember anything after that…that's why I want to die…I don't remember anything…God doesn't remember anything…I don't even know why I'm here anymore…I want to go home…</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> You can go home whenever you want, SCP-905 old friend, but we're not going to let you die right now, are we? So that's something we'll have to fix first, okay?</p><p><strong>SCP-905:</strong> Home…yes yes I do want to go home…yes yes home is good…but no no no no no no no no no no no God doesn't want to go home…you can't make God go home…that's what they told me but they lied to me…they lied to me God doesn't want to go home and He has been sad ever since He was born and now He wants to die too and he
