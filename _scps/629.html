<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-629</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-629 is to be held in a standard containment locker at Site-██. It is to be regularly checked for any changes in its structure, and any change in its weight is to be investigated. At no time are the two halves of SCP-629 to be separated.</p><p>Objects touching the outside edge of SCP-629 (such as items resting on the surface) are to be inspected for any alterations to their shape or texture. If alterations occur and affect the items being examined, they are to be kept in a separate room until further notice and tested for any anomalous effects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-629 is a wooden board measuring 2.5 m by 0.5 m, with two holes (about 0.4 m diameter) in the center of its surface. When played, SCP-629 produces a variety of sounds similar to those produced by an old-fashioned phonograph. A human being may sit on SCP-629 and will be transported to the location where they had been sitting when playing SCP-629.</p><p>SCP-629 was found in ████████, United Kingdom during an investigation of anomalous entities related to the ██████ family. SCP-629 appeared to be one of many phono tapes owned by the family, and was found in a box labeled "The Summer Words Issue." Audio recordings were subsequently discovered among their other possessions.</p><p>Only one person has been able to use SCP-629 while they were still alive; this person was experimenting with its effects while intoxicated prior to their death. It is believed that the phono tape in this instance was not moving very far from them at any given time, as similar instances have occurred despite living over eight hundred miles apart from each other at the time.</p><p>Upon playback of these audio recordings, subjects have reported feeling a sense of nostalgia for an experience that could only have happened during their summer vacation at a family resort in [REDACTED]. Several psychological examinations conducted with these subjects afterward confirmed that they had spent much of their childhood at this resort and therefore were strongly affected when recalling this incident later in life.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
