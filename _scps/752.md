<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-752</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-752 is to be stored in a standard Safe-class containment chamber, lined with 6 cm of lead. The container is to be kept at all times in the same location, covered with a heavy-duty tarpaulin. No heat source is permitted within the containment chamber, and any external temperature must be monitored daily. SCP-752 is not permitted to be exposed to direct sunlight or opened for any reason.</p><p>The contents of SCP-752 are to remain sealed at all times. No human personnel (including Foundation staff) are to enter SCP-752's containment chamber without testing authorization from a Level 4 researcher. Any SCP objects found in SCP-752 must be captured and properly contained, such as by the use of a vacuum seal.</p><p>No more than four D-class personnel are to interact with SCP-752 simultaneously; if more than four D-class personnel are present within its containment chamber, the contents of SCP-752 are not safe and should be evacuated immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-752 is a brilliant, translucent liquid that has no physical characteristic of any known chemical or material. SCP-752 does not burn or degrade; it will not melt and will always be completely rigid when exposed to open flame. Although SCP-752 freely passes through small cracks, breaking any large enough to allow the passage of human fingers, its containment chamber must be lined with at least 6 cm of lead in order to prevent leakage.</p><p>Pouring SCP-752 into any container smaller than a standard 3-liter beer dispenser (such as a 2-liter soda bottle) will immediately cause all liquids within the container to evaporate. However, SCP-752 continues to remain intact, remaining intact and in full concentration regardless of whether the container is opened or sealed. SCP-752 cannot be stored in any vat of liquid, but will rapidly destroy whatever is placed within it once its containment chamber is breached.</p><p>The effect of pouring SCP-752 onto a flat surface (such as concrete) is different. On contact with any object made from glass or transparent materials, SCP-752 will congeal into tens of thousands of "pinpoints," which are each barely visible without direct illumination and almost impossible to distinguish from one another if viewed directly under normal light conditions. The "pinpoints" appear to be alive; they move on their own, attempt to keep their orientation toward sunlight and appear to have an intelligence beyond that of animals. Once left alone for more than 72 hours, these "pinpoints" will begin making noise at irregular intervals and increase in size over the course of about 12 hours until they resemble a tiny manmade settlement called "Resonance City." Currently, no containment measures have been found capable of preventing this effect.</p><p>SCP-752 was recovered on ██/██/2000 after local police were sent to ██████ ██████████, where several citizens reported hearing noises resembling pavement scraping and growing over several nights prior to discovery. Foundation agents were able to track down the source of the anomalous occurrences; however, it was determined that during transport by helicopter, the liquid contents of SCP-752 reached the ground below and began spreading out over several blocks. Witnesses indicated that there were no less than 50 "pinpoints" present within the area before Foundation personnel arrived on-site.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum [752-1]:</strong> On ██/██/200█, Site-██ was overrun by a group of SCP objects labeled as SCP-███. Since the breach, all liquid containment facilities have been placed on lockdown for the safety of personnel.']</p>
