<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-67</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the nature of SCP-67, containment has been deemed impossible.</p><p>For the time being, SCP-67 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-64. Any personnel who come into contact with SCP-67 are to be terminated immediately by authorized personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-67 is a crow. SCP-67 demonstrates the ability to pick up inanimate objects, and will do so at random. This ability has not yet been replicated.</p><p>While SCP-67 is capable of picking up things, it has shown no skill in doing so. When asked, SCP-67 is unable to describe what it is doing when picking something up. SCP-67 seems completely unaware of its anomalous behavior.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 67-1:</strong> SCP-67 was recovered in ██████, New York.</p><p>A witness claimed that SCP-67 picked up one of their children. The Foundation was alerted and took SCP-67 into custody. SCP-67 was then brought to the Foundation's containment facility at Site-64 and is currently undergoing observation and study."]</p>
