<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-91</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-91 is to be kept in the Arsenal Storage Wing of Site-77, away from all other objects. The object is to be inspected once every one (1) month for dust and other debris. Any material detected beyond the limits of acceptable wear are to be removed using a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-91 appears to be a silver-plated pocket watch of unknown origin composed of a highly durable metal (see List of Diameters). The front of the object features a small circular window approximately one (1) meter in diameter, through which it is possible to see an image of the object's owner. Some believe that this would be the face of "Vincent Van Gogh"; however, the image is consistent with that of Thomas Adams, who was born in 1873. It is unknown whether SCP-91 can identify its owner by any other means than through the window.</p><p>The back of SCP-91 displays a lockbox at its center (approximate size: 2 x 1.5 meters), through which the user must insert a key in order to access the object's contents.</p><p>When opened, in addition to various tools and armor, SCP-91 will display various items that appear to have been placed within over time. These include:</p><p>Note that these items are always arranged in their original orientation, with no apparent attempt at keeping them organized or disturbed.</p><p>SCP-91 has been valued for historical purposes on several occasions. The Foundation has determined that when an item has been viewed multiple times within the past ██ years and still remains unchanged, it may be classified as an SCP object. Objects such as SCP-231, SCP-914 and SCP-1108 fall into this category. However, as such items have not had as many viewings or have not remained unchanged over time, they have not been classified as SCPs.</p><p>It is unknown how long SCP-91 has existed or whether it was ever intelligent; however, it is assumed that it originated from some point prior to 1900 CE. As such, it can be assumed that its method of identifying itself and keeping itself organized predates it being placed in the lockbox. All attempts by researchers to discover an origin date for SCP-91 are unsuccessful.</p><p>While there are no records on any further instances of SCP-91 being discovered outside of locked boxes, all contained items have proven themselves to be vanishingly rare and high quality; examples are as follows:</p><p>SCP - 91 Item Dimensions Dimensions Image Description 1 A sword approximately three (3)

<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, Officer ██████ tried to open SCP-91 to observe the contents. Despite being a member of the Break and Enter Response Team, no amount of force was able to open the object. However, due to his inability to open the object, it was decided that he would be demoted and assigned to other duties.</p>
