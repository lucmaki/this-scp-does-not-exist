<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-93</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A tracking device is to be installed in the ██████ Trading Company building in New York City. The facility is currently under Foundation control. All personnel entering the facility must wear an anti-dimensional interface system that neutralizes the anomaly. Project Safe Haven has been established to maintain and secure SCP-93.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-93 is an area of ██████ Trading Company, located in New York City, that seems to extend infinitely. Within this area exist SCP-93 instances, entities whose composition and appearance change depending on the environment of SCP-93. The exact number of SCP-93 instances is unknown, as the area of SCP-93 has never been fully explored.</p><p>Each instance is made up of the collective unconsciousness of all humans currently within the area designated to them by their designation numbers. Instances composing SCP-93 are able to communicate with each other through dreams and can project dreams onto living beings they encounter within SCP-93. While interacting with an SCP-93 instance from a different designation (designation numbers 1– 999) it is possible for a human subject to be covertly manipulated by the SCP-93 instance controlling them.</p><p>After being inside an SCP-93 instance for more than 24 hours, any human viewing the dream who does not have anti-dimensional interface system will begin the process of becoming an instance of the dreamscape. The instance will evolve and increase in size over time, attacking any humans not wearing anti-dimensional interface systems until all humans outside of their designated area have been digested or killed by their new environment. Any humans sleeping within an SCP-93 instance during this period will also be digested; one such subject was rescued after nine days inside an instance with no sleep deprivation noted.</p><p>SCP-173, who is regarded as neutral with respect to how it behaves in dreams, cannot enter an SCP-93 instance without coming out of containment. Once it enters someone's dream, a portal will appear at the location of its closest point to the dreamer and they will be drawn into it without any resistance unless they are wearing a device capable of countering this anomaly.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
