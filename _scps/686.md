<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-686</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The house in which SCP-686 is contained should be kept at a temperature of between 5° and 15°C. Any attempts to lower the temperature of SCP-686's enclosure (through deliberate tampering or accidental cover heating) will cause direct damage to it. In order to prevent this, the temperature should be monitored and appropriate counteractions taken if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-686 is a animate bear, approximately 2.5 meters long. The fur covers the majority of its body, except for its face and hands. Under the fur, SCP-686's skin is pink and decorated with numerous tattoos. The tattoo designs are not uniform, although they do appear to be formed from handwriting — it has been noted that a script similar to that used in medieval French was used.</p><p>When spoken to or otherwise approached by human beings, SCP-686 will respond in a manner considered threatening by most humans as well as any non-anomalous bears — this includes growling, snarling, and occasionally lunging at the subject.</p><p>If left outside its containment area for an extended period of time, SCP-686 can be induced to enter what appears to be a hibernation state (referred to as 'slumber' in the documentation) which lasts approximately four hours; during this period it is impossible for SCP-686 to be physically moved or interacted with directly. If the subject attempts to remove themselves from the vicinity during this time, SCP-687 will quickly appear and drag them back into an unknown location where they will remain until reawakening.</p><p>Subjects near SCP-686 during slumber will report noticing a "humanoid figure" moving around on its back. During these periods of observation, photographs taken appear significantly sharper than normal (this appears to be independent from SCP-687's actions).</p>
