<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-668</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area in which SCP-668 is contained has been impounded. No additional containment measures are required at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-668 is an average-sized house located on the outskirts of ███████, Norway. SCP-668 appears to have been abandoned at some point; there is no furniture or household goods present in the structure, and a large amount of domestic excrement (including what appears to be a pet dog) has accumulated on the floors and walls.</p><p>When one enters SCP-668, it becomes apparent that the entire building is inhabited by a single person. The occupant(s) do not make any attempt to leave during observation, and instead continuously emit low-level noises such as whispering and sniffing. The occupant(s) do not appear to be aware of observers; when asked direct questions, the occupant(s) will show no signs of awareness of their surroundings or presence.</p><p>SCP-668 can only be entered once every month, and only with permission from or at the request of one individual who has remained in residence for an extended amount of time at least three years prior. Despite normal human lifespan being around 80 years, occupants of SCP-668 consistently report feeling "old". This can vary from 3 weeks to 5 months between occupants.</p><p>Inhabitants state that entering/exiting SCP-668 feels significantly different than leaving its confines. Many report apathy during their short departures, though they are able to provide detailed descriptions of what they experienced while they were present in SCP-668. Several researchers who have attempted to leave SCP-668 report feelings of euphoria and general well being while remaining within its boundaries; however, none have stayed longer than 5 days inside SCP-668 before attempting to leave again.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> It has been discovered that the resident of SCP-668 is in fact an old man (referred to as "The Old Man" by its occupant(s)). The Old Man\'s family name and birthdate are unknown, but it is known that he was born sometime around 1550.</p><p>On investigation of SCP-668\'s occupants, it was found that the Old Man had entered into a contract with several entities believed to originate from other dimensions, which caused SCP-668 to become a permanent residence for them. The Old Man was able to enter SCP-668 once every month, and the entities could move freely within its confines. As of now, no further information regarding these entities can be obtained due to their nature being indeterminate.</p><p>Researchers entering SCP-668 without permission from The Old Man are not able to leave alive. Attempts to interact with the residents of SCP-668 while they are present in SCP-668 have proven to be fruitless; the only effect that appears to be accomplished is the temporary disruption of a number of random objects in the area. See Incident Log 668-I for further details.</p><p><strong>Incident Log 668-I:</strong> On ██/██/████, Researcher ██████ attempted to leave SCP-668 unannounced and was immediately killed by the occupant(s). Several seconds after his death, a large amount of household waste fell out of the ceiling above him. This waste consisted primarily of human excrement (which appeared to have been excreted by the Researcher) and a few small pieces of partially burned paper. The paper was recovered, and it revealed an unreadable note that read:</p><p>"DEATH IS A CHANGE."']</p>
