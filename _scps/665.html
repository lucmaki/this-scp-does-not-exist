<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-665</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-665 is contained in a standard containment chamber, guarded by armed security personnel. Subject may request for an unsupervised visit to the lab; such requests must be approved by both Site staff and O-4.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-665 is a Caucasian male with short black hair. On the left side of the subject's forehead is a permanent indentation, measuring approximately 3 mm in depth and 2 cm in diameter at its maximum extent; the right side of the subject's forehead has a similar indentation, but measuring approximately 11 mm in depth and 9 cm in diameter. Due to the severe stress placed on the subject by these marks, they are not considered as permanent alterations to the subject's body. The subject also has no apparent conscious reaction to their presence, despite evidence suggesting otherwise.</p><p>SCP-665 is capable of telekinesis at an unknown level, but appears to be limited to simple objects such as small metallic tools, paper items, and so on; the degree of control exerted is unknown. SCP-665 appears to have no memory of performing any of these actions; testing has revealed that SCP-665 can resist attempts at concentration or control through traditional means. However, attempting to physically restrain or prevent SCP-665 from performing an action invariably results in this action being completed successfully, even if SCP-665 has little knowledge of its telekinetic ability.</p><p>SCP-665 was initially found in a state of mild shock following a motor vehicle accident. It was taken into custody for psychological observation and treatment, after which it was given standard amnestic treatment and released into civilian life. Following medical follow up, SCP-665 was reclassified as Euclid and consigned to Site 19.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
