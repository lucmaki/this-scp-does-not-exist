<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-702</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-702 is to be kept in an airtight, climate-controlled chamber. The chamber is to be made of steel with a double layer of 1 cm thick polyethylene sheeting mounted on three sides. Surrounding the containment area are layers of polystyrene, fibreglass insulation, and a 6 m layer of concrete. A minimum of 8 cm of concrete is to surround the containment area and be lifted by an average level foundation for added security.</p><p>No personnel other than SCP-702 is allowed within 4 meters of the anomaly at any time. Guards should patrol the perimeter of this restricted area at all times, and remain vigilant for any signs of contamination or tampering by unauthorized personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-702 is a pair of female humanoid entities, approximately 3 m tall, with muscular bodies and musculature. SCP-702 is biologically male, but has been anomalously transformed into women by a unique and unknown species whose physiology is not compatible with human biology.</p><p>SCP-702's skin colour is a light grey tone, matching their bone structure and muscle tissues. The female entities' skin has the texture of putty (harder than human skin) and will not tear or tear easily.</p><p>SCP-802 is considered the 'normal' form of SCP-702, while SCP-703 appears to be physically 81 kg heavier than its partner. The male entity's arm movements are noticeably slower compared to its female counterpart.</p><p>SCP-703 appears to have physical limitations whereas SCP-702 displays no such limitations. SCP-703 also displays an abnormal resistance to damage caused by physical forces, requiring a higher amount of force to break through their skin than that of normal humans. For example, a steel ball impacting on their chest muscle would result in injury for humans, but not for SCP-703.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-702 was discovered in ████, Australia after a major flood during the construction of a dam. After several weeks of searching, Foundation staff found a large underground cavern with the anomalous entities, who were unconscious and submerged in a dilute acid solution.</p><p>The entities were brought to Site ██ for experimentation. They are currently kept in a 2\xa0m x 2\xa0m chamber, surrounded by water with a neutral pH. A sample of their blood is being held at Site ██ for analysis.</p><p>When exposed to high levels of light, SCP-702 will begin to expand at an exponential rate until they reach their normal size. For example, if they are placed on a scale and exposed to sunlight, they would grow to the size of a small house over the course of several minutes (the scale needed to measure the size of SCP-702 is not known).']</p>
