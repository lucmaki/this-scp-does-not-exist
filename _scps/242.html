<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-242</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-242 is to be kept in a large, inhospitable volcanic region in the Indian Ocean. SCP-242's area of effect is to be surrounded by a fence with barbed wire extending six meters underground, and patrolled by security personnel at all times. The area surrounding SCP-242 is to have no civilian population; any such individuals who enter its area of effect are to be questioned about the object, and then handled accordingly.</p><p>Any civilians who enter SCP-242's area of effect, even unintentionally, are to be detained and interrogated regarding their knowledge of SCPs. The information obtained is to be recorded and the subjects released after undergoing amnestic treatment and psychological evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-242 is a large, circular, obsidian-like rock. The outer face of the object reads "ΤΕΛΜΑΣ" (TELAMACHUS) in ancient Greek, roughly meaning “Telemachus”. The inner face of the object contains a stylized image of a man's face.</p><p>Anyone who looks at SCP-242 for long enough will become trapped within SCP-242's area of effect, regardless of whether they are able to see it. Though this effect does not last over several hours, those affected find that they cannot leave its area of effect for several days or longer. This effect also works in reverse; anyone who enters SCP-242's area of effect will return to the location they would be if they had just looked at it.</p><p>SCP-242 is extremely hostile towards humans, and will attack any human who enters its area of effect without first having been instructed by said subject to do so. Its attacks include:</p><p>SCP-242 will appear as a literal rock to anyone not actively looking at it, and immediately attack any humans who enter close proximity to it. It has been observed affecting subjects as far away as 200 km, and has apparently slain subjects who have been in active combat with other SCP objects.</p><p>SCP-242 was discovered in 1979 by an Australian woman named Rita Williams during radar testing directed at nearby volcanoes. Interviews with civilians indicate that the area where SCP-242 appeared was uninhabited prior to 1979, with the maximum amount of human habitation existing around 100 km from SCP-242's location; all civilians interviewed have claimed that they did not notice SCP-242 when they first looked at it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
