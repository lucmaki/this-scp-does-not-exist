<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-259</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-259 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-77. It is to be equipped with a video camera and microphone, both of which are to be mounted outside of its iron boundaries. Any personnel approaching SCP-259 are to be informed that it has "do not touch" written in large letters on its side. At no time is it to be opened or removed from its enclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-259 is a standard human hand, of average size and weight. It cannot move freely, but it can hold small or heavy objects. It can be opened or closed without fail, even while SCP-259 is not being observed. SCP-259 can also function as a remote control for various electronic devices within its range, up to a distance of six meters. SCP-259 was found in █████████████ ████, United Kingdom, at the house of █████ ██████, who lived alone. [DATA EXPUNGED]</p><p>When using SCP-259 as a remote control, there are no recorded instances of SCP-259's remote being used while not directly controlled by an individual's hands. When this remote control is used by an outside party (one known to have seen the instant in which the device starts to work), any recorded instances of the use of said device cease. When an outside party uses their own hands as remote controls for the item, all instances continue.</p><p>SCP-259 does not appear to have any effect on electronic devices that do not require the use of hands to operate. The affects that it has upon electronics seem to vary with the person using it, ranging from them disappearing completely[1], to making the device explode[2], setting it on fire[3], or simply making it go dead[4]. SCP-259's current primary effect is to allow non-anomalous individuals to operate complex machines with ease. This appears to be very difficult for non-anomalous individuals; most tests have shown that only 5% of such people are able to do so. Testing on D-Class personnel has shown a 90% success rate for this operation.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Testing Log 259-1</p><p>Test #259-1</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1289</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-1289 is to be instructed to use SCP-259 to operate a VCR. The tape is to be inserted and the machine turned on.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Nothing. No sound. No picture. VCR turns off and does not turn back on.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Test was repeated with D-1289, but no change to results.</p><p>Test #259-2</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1289</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-1289 is to be instructed to use SCP-259 to operate a VCR with a tape that had been playing for at least thirty seconds. Tape was found to be "boring", with no sound or picture recorded on it. Tape was also found to have been played over five times, but the machine did not register any of these playbacks.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Nothing. No sound. No picture. VCR turns off and does not turn back on.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> D-1289 was instructed to cut himself while operating the VCR as a test for a possible effect on the machine by SCP-259\'s anomalous properties, but he was unable to do so. Blood from the injury remained, but blood from the previous five cuts all expired within two minutes of each other through a variety of systems, including the skin itself, which absorbed it all.</p><p>Test #259-3</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1289</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-1289 is to be instructed to operate a VCR with a tape that had been playing for at least thirty seconds.
