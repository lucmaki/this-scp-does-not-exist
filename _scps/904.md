<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-904</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> To prevent a generation of SCP-904-1 from occurring, all wildlife within the boundaries of the Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust is to be logged, tagged and monitored. The Trust is to be involved in the removal of all SCP-904-1 specimens from public view, on a monthly basis, to supplement containment efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-904 is a species of animal (identified as a Chamois, Rupicapra rupicapra) that has the ability to manifest inanimate objects within its body. This manifests as two heads (referred to as SCP-904-1) that are attached to the torso of the host animal, with their limbs extending outwards. SCP-904-1 specimens are indistinguishable from standard heads, save for their location; SCP-904-1 will exist wherever there is an opening in the host animal that can be used for locomotion.</p><p>SCP-904-1 will attempt to exit the body through this opening, and will continue attempting to leave until the host relaxes the muscles between their legs, at which point SCP-904-1 will be removed from both sides of the opening and positioned over it, before entering. The gap between both bodies extends for approximately 1.5 meters before closing naturally over time.</p><p>SCP-904 was discovered after several reports were made by local residents of two identical animals appearing in front of their homes. Upon investigation, Foundation agents were sent to examine the animals, who were successfully treated and contained after exhibiting no signs of abnormal behaviour.</p><p>Records show that SCP-904 originally existed in Africa and Arabia during the Pleistocene period, when they were well known for migrating across land masses and forming large herds. They were believed to have died out around 5500 years ago due to widespread deforestation and climate change but now remanifest spontaneously across Britain at an average rate of one per year. As such, it is impossible to predict when SCP-904 will eventually die out due to its impossible reproduction rate; however, it is theorised that it may take several hundred years for this to happen.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 904-1:</strong> On 06/23/09, SCP-904-1 was given the designation SCP-904 after it was discovered to be reproducing in the Isle of Wight. The Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust was commissioned to gather information on both the cause and effects of SCP-904.']</p>
