<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-924</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-924 is located in a containment locker in Site-56's Safe SCP-Classified Item Storage Wing. The containment locker is to be kept at room temperature and humidity levels of 80% and 50%, respectively. All original comics in SCP-924 are to be removed from their original envelopes, placed inside appropriate clear plastic sleeves, and stored with the object.</p><p>No research on this object is to be conducted unless specifically authorized by Drs. ████████ and ████████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-924 is an envelope of approximately fifty (50) copies of a comic book titled "Comix City". The comic book is itself unremarkable in appearance, with the exception of a handwritten address label on the back cover. All copies of SCP-924 have been extensively examined and contain no signs of tampering.</p><p>When opened and held over a non-combustible surface, copies of SCP-924 spontaneously combust at a rate of approximately one copy per second (1:00). Instances of SCP-924 have been observed to come into contact with air under normal atmospheric conditions. After incineration, the ashes produced by these instances contain a single printed title screen from the comic book. No other text or imagery has been produced thus far.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Incident 924-A:</p><p>On ██/██/██, researcher ███████ was assigned to examine copies of SCP-924. After opening a copy of the comic book, researcher ███████ placed the object onto a nearby piece of paper. The paper spontaneously combusted at its original speed of one copy per second (1:00). Upon further examination, it was discovered that the paper's original content was also a copy of SCP-924. All other copies of SCP-924 in the containment locker spontaneously combusted in a similar manner.</p><p>Upon being informed of this incident, Drs. ████████ and ████████ conducted an investigation into the possibility of the existence of additional copies of SCP-924. Digital copies of the contents of all original copies were examined, and no additional copies were found."]</p>
