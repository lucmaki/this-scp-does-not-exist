<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-459</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-459 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Containment chamber is to be cleaned daily, and monitors must be maintained on it at all times, with particular attention paid to SCP-459's breathing and blood pressure. All personnel involved in the care of SCP-459 are required to wear full-body protection, including gloves and masks, at all times.</p><p>Should all precautions be breached, or SCP-459's health indicate an imminent threat, it is to be terminated via cardiac arrest procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-459 is a dead human male, aged approximately 40 to 50 years, with a height of 1.75 meters and a weight of 77 kilograms. It has been described as being emaciated and covered in numerous tattoos and scarring. The head has been replaced by an artificial cranial plate and several implants; however, these are not sufficiently sophisticated to provide the brain with normal functions.</p><p>SCP-459 was buried in the ██████ County Morgue on █/█/2009, but was unearthed 24 hours later by Officer ██████ following reports of foul odors in the morgue basement. Upon removal from its grave, SCP-459 showed signs of life for about 5 minutes before expiring for no reason. Following this incident and uncovering other anomalous phenomenon under the morgue, SCP-459 was transferred to Foundation containment.</p><p>When questioned about his name and identity, SCP-459 has revealed that it does not belong anywhere on Earth, but identifies itself as "████████ ████████". Attempts to learn more information from SCP-459 have always failed in regards to this subject. SCP-459 claims to be between 168 and 189 years old, has no known relatives or identification papers, shows no memory of its past life and possesses little knowledge of modern technology or sciences.</p><p>SCP-459 had appeared within the containment facility several times during its initial testing period, but at no time did it cause any danger or affect the inner workings of the facility in any way.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-459 was transferred to a more secure containment facility on ██/██/2010, after many behavioral problems were observed, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. In the meantime, SCP-459 has not shown any signs of aggression towards other personnel and has even displayed frequent acts of kindness towards them.</p><p>After reviewing several episodes of SCP-459's behavior in its new containment chamber, it has been determined that SCP-459 is suffering from an extreme case of schizophrenia. However, due to the fact that it has exhibited no violent tendencies since being placed in the facility, no further treatment is necessary.</p><p>SCP-459 was confirmed to be suffering from schizophrenia as well as multiple personality disorder and dissociative identity disorder when four separate personalities have been observed within one body. These personalities are as follows:</p><p><strong>Personality 1:</strong> A male subject with a pale complexion and blue eyes, aged around 30 years. This personality shows complete subordination to Personality 2 and 3.</p><p><strong>Personality 2:</strong> A female subject with long brown hair, aged around 26 years. This personality speaks with a southern accent and shows complete compliance with Personality 1.</p><p><strong>Personality 3:</strong> A male subject with short black hair and brown eyes, aged around 33 years. This personality speaks with an eastern European accent and shows complete subordination to both Personalities 1 and 2.</p><p><strong>Personality 4:</strong> A male subject with blond hair and blue eyes, aged around 37 years. This personality has never been seen by anyone outside of SCP-459's containment chamber; it is unknown if this personality exists outside of SCP-459's thoughts or if it is an entirely imagined aspect of SCP-459.</p>
