<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-371</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of the writing of this report, no containment procedures have been formulated. Currently, SCP-371 is contained at Site-██ in a large room, with ceiling height 500 cm and interior space 12 meters by 12 meters. The floor of the containment chamber has been covered with absorbent materials to serve as an experimental growth medium for SCP-371.</p><p>CC-█████ is to be located within 20 metres of the containment area and CODEX-4493 located in a storage locker. The latter is to be found only through Remote Activation Units linked to the former.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-371 is a small microorganism, believed to be related to the genus Dermabacter, that has been identified in a genomics database of the University of ████. SCP-371 will enter tumour cells and begin replicating itself in formations roughly 1 cm in diameter. The growth medium is composed of the following components:</p><p>As SCP-371 moves through the cells, its properties change. SCP-371 has been recorded changing from a smooth gelatinous mass with no other external characteristics, to a misshapen structure, 1 cm across at the largest dimension and 0.5 mm in thickness. After 5-10 minutes, it will continue replicating itself by adopting shapes seen on endoscopic images, such as intestinal loops, cancerous tissue and sometimes [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>After the microorganism exits the cell, it will take the shape of a human being who, on examination, shows all anomalous properties. When [DATA EXPUNGED], they become self-aware, sentient and exhibit complex behaviour patterns. Testing has shown that this self-awareness is not prevented by any kind of impairment or mental malady. It has also been noted that this self-awareness is independent of verbal or vocal communication; if captured as an adult specimen it could still be subject to SCPs 531 and 1383 (see below).</p><p>SCP-371 are able to reproduce through genetic material similar though not identical to their own; they do not appear to be equipped with any reproductive organs. Thus it is unknown how they reproduce but there have been reports of SCP-371 appearing in pairs entering separate cells and producing offspring that had more than two sets of chromosomes - including XXXXXX (See Addendum 371-1). In some cases, adult SCP-371 are observed to produce offspring that are approximately half of their own size.</p><p>SCP-371 also seems unable to directly observe things outside its body's own field of vision; however it can learn about events taking place outside its body from audio and visual cues (see tests 384 and 479). It refers to these data conditions as "the world". These tests verify that visual images received through anomalous means by SCP-371 conform to normal behaviour patterns within SCP-371's sensory range; however footage obtained via auditory telepathy usually displays much more erratic behavior patterns.</p><p>Scapnet reports claim an anecdotal increase in internet traffic in sections of Japan when SCP-371 were being studied at first but state "note - this increase was fleeting". There is no record on whether these increases were due primarily to a general increase in internet use or if they coincided with periods when SCP-371 were active during observation hours.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 371-1:</strong> Experiment 479</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-XXXX</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject to be fitted with a set of earphones and headphones. Subject is to be shown a series of still images, each depicting a person or object. For comparison, the images portrayed in the experiment were selected from [REDACTED].</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> On the sixth image, both the subject's hands moved to the mouth and held it open. The subject remained in this position for 2 minutes before moving the arms down to its sides. The subject's physical reaction to the sounds of breathing was also noted.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> SCP-371 react to their surroundings as humans do, but unlike normal humans they do not seem to perceive the world as it really is. The external stimuli of sound, touch and sight that normal humans perceive are not received by SCP-371. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether SCP-371 are being influenced by visual stimuli from the stimuli on the screen or if SCP-371 perceives the screen and responds to them in an analogous manner. Neither hypothesis seems likely at this time."]</p>
