<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-567</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-567 is to be stored in a standard containment unit at its site of origin, and is to be fed once per week. A security camera set is to be maintained on the premises in an area where no humans are allowed, and all persons who enter SCP-567's containment unit are to be monitored by security personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-567 is a collection of unmanned robotic vehicles, designed to resemble the International Space Station (ISS) and its onboard modules. The ISS is approximately 27 meters long and weighs approximately 44 tons, while all of the models contained by SCP-567 are approximately 4 meters in length, 2.5 meters in width, and weigh 110 pounds. All models have a reddish-orange exterior paint finish and a white interior, as well as an inner transparent plastic casing; no markings or identifying features are present on these objects.</p><p>The ISS has 33 operational docking ports ranging from 20 mm to 7 m overall in size and ranging from 30 m to 3 km in distance. It has 33 main solar panels with an average diameter of 5 m covering a surface area of 25 m². No docking port has been extruded from either object.</p><p>A wide variety of tools and components for constructing the International Space Station are contained within SCP-567, including:</p><p>SCP-567 was discovered on ██/██/1970 at [REDACTED], [REDACTED], when multiple reports were made regarding several metallic objects that did not appear to have any sources of power or operation. After being examined by Foundation personnel, it was determined that they contained a variety of tools and spare parts along with various items that resembled pieces of the International Space Station payload that had failed to launch during the space shuttles' first few flights. There was also one instance of a motion sensor which responded to auditory commands, although it could not be located afterwards.</p><p>Discovery Log:</p><p>Date: ██/██/1970 - 11:30 hours</p><p>Location: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Arizona</p><p>Time: 11:30 PM</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
