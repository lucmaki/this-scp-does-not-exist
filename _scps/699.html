<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-699</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-699 is to be contained in a temperature-controlled reinforced steel container comprised of a combination of proprietary and standard hard metals, with an interior cavity measuring 15 cm x 3 cm. The interior is to be coated with a lunar dust layer over a thickness of 2 cm to prevent damage from the natural abrasiveness of the metallic surface. A quartz enclosure will contain a 10,000mW microwave energy source, which will be directed at the interior of SCP-699 to keep it at the highest heat value attainable. The chamber must be kept insulated by means of standard space technology fabric.</p><p>SCP-699 is to be stored in an underground facility within Site-77's Secure Containment Vault. This containment area is to be maintained at a consistent temperature of 27°C; all personnel exposed to the area are to wear protective clothing, goggles, and gloves when interacting with SCP-699.</p><p>All testing must be conducted under the supervision of Dr. David J. Morgan.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-699 is a "vacuum tube" anteroventral cerebral unit (AVCU) recovered from the corpse of a male Caucasian female, identified as █████ ████████ ████████, who died on March 17th, 2021. The AVCU was discovered in a crematory apparatus at the ████ ████████ Funeral Home.</p><p>The body was exhumed in order to perform DNA and tissue typing analysis, after which it was scheduled for burial. However, before the undertaker's staff could begin the task of carrying out the procedures, the casket was shattered by a nearby seismic event (see below). The mechanical structure within SCP-699 did not crack or move in any other irregular fashion.</p><p>The remains were reinterred and all funeral services for █████ ████████ were cancelled. Though her family initially refused to have SCP-699 reactivated, they later agreed after SCP-699 displayed anomalous functions during a meeting with her sister. This prompted the family to request that SCP-699 be donated to Foundation custody; this action was approved shortly thereafter.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum-699-A:</strong> SCP-699's remains were exhumed once again in order to perform a complete examination. The following was discovered.</p><p>SCP-699 and the AVCU are composed of a red, rubbery substance, markedly similar to human brain tissue. Biochemistry tests indicated that the structure is composed entirely of amino acids, sugars, and other organic compounds. Biological tests confirmed that the substance is composed of living tissue and does not contain any anomalous organisms. All known cells within the structure of SCP-699 were identified through standard genetic testing.</p><p>DNA analysis confirmed that SCP-699 and its AVCU are a female, confirmed as █████ ████████ ████████. The AVCU is identical to the left one in young adulthood, except for a single anomalous trait. The right AVCU has twice the normal number of neurons present in the brain, with each neuron containing twice as many axons as would be expected for a healthy human brain. The neurons are arranged in a manner similar to a normal human brain, but they are connected to each other by a series of data cables that appear to serve some sort of function within the structure of SCP-699.</p><p>No meaningful difference was found between the left and right sides of the AVCU. However, both sides of SCP-699 are significantly larger than would be expected for a human brain, with the right side far larger than the left. The right side is also significantly heavier than the left side; on average, SCP-699 weighs approximately 1 kilogram more than its left side.</p><p>The exact reason for this difference is unknown; however, it has been hypothesised that SCP-699 contains some sort of neural network or computer system within its structure. The usual function of an AVCU is to provide constant output to the brain; however, no clear purpose for such a large region has been discovered.</p><p>The brain tissue itself is composed of large numbers of fibrous tubes connecting various structures together; no organelles or other relevant structures have been found. It is unknown if there are any external connections to the outside world. The fibers are non-anomalous in nature; they do not appear to be made up of anything other than the same organic compounds present within the rest of the structure.</p><p>The fibers also appear to be conduits for some kind of fluid, which is distributed along their length by means of pumps and valves at regular intervals. This material can be observed moving along the fibers under magnification and thermal analysis; however, attempts at separating it from the fibers have so far been unsuccessful.</p>
