<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-699</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-699 is to be contained in a temperature-controlled reinforced steel container comprised of a combination of proprietary and standard hard metals, with an interior cavity measuring 15 cm x 3 cm. The interior is to be coated with a lunar dust layer over a thickness of 2 cm to prevent damage from the natural abrasiveness of the metallic surface. A quartz enclosure will contain a 10,000mW microwave energy source, which will be directed at the interior of SCP-699 to keep it at the highest heat value attainable. The chamber must be kept insulated by means of standard space technology fabric.</p><p>SCP-699 is to be stored in an underground facility within Site-77's Secure Containment Vault. This containment area is to be maintained at a consistent temperature of 27°C; all personnel exposed to the area are to wear protective clothing, goggles, and gloves when interacting with SCP-699.</p><p>All testing must be conducted under the supervision of Dr. David J. Morgan.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-699 is a "vacuum tube" anteroventral cerebral unit (AVCU) recovered from the corpse of a male Caucasian female, identified as █████ ████████ ████████, who died on March 17th, 2021. The AVCU was discovered in a crematory apparatus at the ████ ████████ Funeral Home.</p><p>The body was exhumed in order to perform DNA and tissue typing analysis, after which it was scheduled for burial. However, before the undertaker's staff could begin the task of carrying out the procedures, the casket was shattered by a nearby seismic event (see below). The mechanical structure within SCP-699 did not crack or move in any other irregular fashion.</p><p>The remains were reinterred and all funeral services for █████ ████████ were cancelled. Though her family initially refused to have SCP-699 reactivated, they later agreed after SCP-699 displayed anomalous functions during a meeting with her sister. This prompted the family to request that SCP-699 be donated to Foundation custody; this action was approved shortly thereafter.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
