<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-262</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-262 is to be kept in a locked standard storage locker at Site-19. Access to the locker requires a level 4 security clearance and is to be restricted to personnel with level 4 clearance or higher. Personnel observing SCP-262 should be at least level 4.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-262 is an analog wristwatch. The watch's face reads "P.T., Attendant Interlude". It was built by TAG Heuer, the same manufacturer as SCP-096, and bears a Tag value of ████.</p><p>SCP-262 only responds to personnel who can confirm their understanding of French. No other language has been found to work with SCP-262, no matter how detailed or complex the translation. When in use, SCP-262 does not attempt to hide itself.</p><p>When activated, it will make one concordant gesture (usually an open palm) at a subject every 8 hours for 24 hours following activation (this time limit is not affected by sleep or rest). If the subject makes no effort to understand the gesture, it will repeat in a loop until a subject understands the message. No other action than understanding the gesture will cause it to stop its motion after 8 hours.</p><p>If a subject successfully activates SCP-262 more than once within a period of four weeks, they become somewhat knowledgeable about French culture and customs and are regarded as members of SCP-260's "staff" despite having no apparent classification or authority. They gradually learn more over roughly 24 hours, until they have memorized most important aspects of French society, culture and history. These subjects lose much of their native vocabulary, but gain new words and phrases which they can use to interact in French with other SCP-262 users — they typically do this while translating messages from one language to another:</p><p>The most notable effects of these changes are that the subjects believe themselves to be at minimum level 4 security clearance and will not react violently unless provoked. They continue using French for communication even when outside of SCP-260/SCP-260's presence and will not pursue any goal that does not involve gaining knowledge of French culture. Subjects also often become depressed if correspondence (in either direction) is broken off entirely for significant time periods. This depression lasts for three months before returning to normal.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 262:</strong> SCP-262 was recovered from a Sécurité Civile office after a raid on an "anti-terrorism" operation in ██████, France. The organization in question was legally known as the Office du Contrôle et de la Sécurité du Territoire and had been operating in secret since 2000. Agents were able to find and arrest only three members of the group, all of whom were easily re-contained. The remaining material was wiped clean of all digital data and destroyed. The three members were terminated as a result of their confessions, then reclassified as SCP-260-Omega and given amnestics.</p>
