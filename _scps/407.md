<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-407</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The perimeter of SCP-407 is to be patrolled at all times. Instances of SCP-407 are located in a small containment coffer and are to be kept in a standard humanoid containment pouch.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-407 are 54 human test subjects who have been infected with the SCP-407 virus and will appear as a humanoid entity when no more humans can be found. Instances of SCP-407 may be identified by their lack of blood and organs.</p><p>The only known method to recover a host is to kill the instance of SCP-407. The body will appear harmless until the body's skin is removed. Once the outer layer is removed, the skin will begin to shrivel and spark, leaving behind a blackened corpse in which the eyes are red with bloodshot pupils and empty sockets.</p><p>SCP-407 is a highly infectious and contagious disease carried via a dormant form in various species of insects and arachnids. Only two known methods of spreading the disease have been found:</p><p>There is no known cure for SCP-407 except for the death of the infected host. Infected bodies will not show signs of infection until the skin has been removed; once the skin has been removed, victims will begin to deteriorate rapidly until death occurs within one day (See Addendum 1). Victims are also highly susceptible to dehydration and malnutrition. Victims lose approximately 10% bodily fluids daily, with severe cases losing up to 25% daily. Death will occur from dehydration after 3-5 days unless treated with intravenous fluids or advanced medical care.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 1:</strong> File on SCP-407</p><p>Experiment Log 407-01</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-3417 was infected with SCP-407 and put into a humanoid containment pouch. The containment pouch was then stored in a standard humanoid containment coffer. All testing was conducted by researcher Dr. ██████.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> D-3417 appeared to be healthy and did not show any signs of infection or decay. D-3417 was then removed from the containment pouch and placed in an insect containment cabinet. D-3417 began to rapidly deteriorate, losing approximately 40% bodily fluids daily. On the seventh day, D-3417 became completely dehydrated and died. Upon autopsy, D-3417's eyes were found to be red with bloodshot pupils and empty sockets.</p><p><strong>After:</strong> After the test, all humanoid SCP's were quarantined and decontaminated with bleach. Personnel who had contact with the infected person were given amnestics."]</p>
