<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-242</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-242 is to be kept in a large, inhospitable volcanic region in the Indian Ocean. SCP-242's area of effect is to be surrounded by a fence with barbed wire extending six meters underground, and patrolled by security personnel at all times. The area surrounding SCP-242 is to have no civilian population; any such individuals who enter its area of effect are to be questioned about the object, and then handled accordingly.</p><p>Any civilians who enter SCP-242's area of effect, even unintentionally, are to be detained and interrogated regarding their knowledge of SCPs. The information obtained is to be recorded and the subjects released after undergoing amnestic treatment and psychological evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-242 is a large, circular, obsidian-like rock. The outer face of the object reads "ΤΕΛΜΑΣ" (TELAMACHUS) in ancient Greek, roughly meaning “Telemachus”. The inner face of the object contains a stylized image of a man's face.</p><p>Anyone who looks at SCP-242 for long enough will become trapped within SCP-242's area of effect, regardless of whether they are able to see it. Though this effect does not last over several hours, those affected find that they cannot leave its area of effect for several days or longer. This effect also works in reverse; anyone who enters SCP-242's area of effect will return to the location they would be if they had just looked at it.</p><p>SCP-242 is extremely hostile towards humans, and will attack any human who enters its area of effect without first having been instructed by said subject to do so. Its attacks include:</p><p>SCP-242 will appear as a literal rock to anyone not actively looking at it, and immediately attack any humans who enter close proximity to it. It has been observed affecting subjects as far away as 200 km, and has apparently slain subjects who have been in active combat with other SCP objects.</p><p>SCP-242 was discovered in 1979 by an Australian woman named Rita Williams during radar testing directed at nearby volcanoes. Interviews with civilians indicate that the area where SCP-242 appeared was uninhabited prior to 1979, with the maximum amount of human habitation existing around 100 km from SCP-242's location; all civilians interviewed have claimed that they did not notice SCP-242 when they first looked at it.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 242-1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/1979, the Australian government began a campaign to evacuate those civilians in the area of SCP-242's effect. The first evacuation effort was carried out by a local police vessel, with the civilians being taken to Cairns in Queensland.</p><p>On ██/██/1979, a civilian was spotted on the radar of the police vessel that was carrying out the evacuation. A helicopter tasked with assisting the evacuation was sent to investigate, and landed nearby. Three other persons were found to be in the area, apparently having been released from SCP-242; all were described as being extremely hostile and aggressive, and were immediately terminated by the helicopter's pilot.</p><p>The remainder of the civilian group were taken aboard the helicopter; however, as they were being evacuated from the area, SCP-242 attacked the helicopter. The pilot ejected, with one of his passengers losing an arm during the escape, while another sustained severe wounds from SCP-242's acid. The remaining passenger was also wounded, but survived. The pilot was presumed killed when his aircraft crashed; however, he was later found alive at a nearby base. The passenger who lost an arm has since been terminated by Dr. ██████; however, the other passenger is still recovering from her injuries and is allowed to remain in Foundation custody."]</p>
