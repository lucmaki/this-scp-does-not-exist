<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-298</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-298 is to be contained in a locked safe within the Foundation's on-site research lab. SCP-298's location within the lab is to remain classified below level 5 clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-298 is a bronze key measuring 70 mm x 50 mm. It is inscribed with an ancient Sumerian symbol (designated SCP-298-A), and is of undetermined origin. The Basra Museum of Antiquities claims that the previously documented locations of SCP-298 had been lost to war prior to their acquisition.</p><p>To date, SCP-298 has not shown any anomalous properties until its activation. Once activated, SCP-298 will begin to bore into materials within a 5 meter radius through both natural and artificial means. The rate of progress is proportional to the amount or density of matter surrounding SCP-298; however, once the key's "target" location has been reached, SCP-298 ceases all current bores and remains stationary in that location until triggered again.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-298 was discovered in the Basra Museum of Antiquities, Iraq, following reports of extensive damage to its surrounding structure. When Foundation agents were able to track down SCP-298's location within the museum, they found it buried in the ground. No similar objects or symbols were found anywhere in its vicinity.</p><p>The object is currently stored in a locked safe within the Foundation's on-site research lab."]</p>
