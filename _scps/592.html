<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-592</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-592 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell measuring 2.5 by 2.5 by 3 m, located in Site 17's low security wing. As SCP-592 spends 18 hours a day in its cell, a standard feeding schedule is to be followed.</p><p>Due to its isolation, SCP-592 requires at least two guards to escort it outside of its cell at all times. Any and all forms of communication with SCP-592 must be done via a one-way mirror used solely for SCP-592's protection. SCP-592 is to be provided with onsite access to a healthy diet and water supply at all times.</p><p>SCP-592 has not responded verbally to the subject of the interview for over a week. It is currently scheduled for interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-592 is an adult male humanoid. It stands at 2.4m in height and weighs 92 kg. Despite the disadvantages of its stature, SCP-592 appears to have a gravity-defying physique, with no visible signs of muscle atrophy or bone deterioration despite its lack of human food for over five years.</p><p>Physically, SCP-592 possesses no superhuman attributes, although it shows extreme resilience to damage. If damaged enough, SCP-592 will writhe and squirm on the floor of its cell until it can heal the wound(s), even if this results in rapid tissue degradation. If completely destroyed, SCP-592 will regenerate itself within two months (see Incident 592-2)</p><p>SCP-592 greets new Foundation personnel by standing up, extending out both arms and speaking their names. A description of this behavior can be found below:</p><p>Interviewed: SCP-592 (Excerpt)</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ████</p><p>Foreword: Interviewed on 09/05/2014 after approximately five months of direct exposure to radio waves from a Foundation manned spacecraft orbiting Earth.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr. ████: How are you feeling today? Any pain? Any problems? Do you need anything?</p><p>SCP-592: I'm fine thanks. Feeling good actually. Don't really have anything of use to say at the moment though, sorry about that! I'll do my best though! Ready for questions?</p><p>Dr. ████: Yeah sure! So…what's your name? Why did you choose a name like that? You're not human are you? What is your species? How long have you been here? What's your purpose with us? Are you hostile or am I just imagining that this is a hostile relationship with our government?</p><p>SCP-592: Yep! That's almost all I've got left! Sorry about that! Haha! Name's Henry █████…came here when I was 9 years old…about 5 years now…b'lieve I'm what they call an anomalous individual…not a monster, just different…uh…but I don't hurt anyone and I'm not trying to embarrass anyone! Haha and yeah it is…er…kinda human but not really because we don't eat food or drink water and it took me a long time to get into shape so I could stand up straight without being broken in half every other day…don't know exactly where I come from but that doesn't matter because this place is awesome except for the mountains…I hate those mountains and hate them for making me fall down all the time and make my bones crack…I'd rather be anywhere else except stuck here in California with these surfing hippies! Shit, man no offense dude but America sucks so hard but whatever, enjoy it for what it's worth…yeah about my species, well I got made in China or something like that though I have no idea how humans were made since they were never around when I was being made so maybe they weren't made then either way it doesn't matter terribly because even if we didn't exist before they came along we would've figured out how we were made pretty fast once they came along because they're so dumb they had to get in trouble because they didn't know how to take care of themselves and ended up putting us back together again without us being able to tell them everything about us before we put ourselves back together correctly so nobody died too quick anymore so yeah great explanation after all these years why we're not as smart as them who we look like which might be why our heads are shaped like ours but fuck that's probably not right since we're twice as big as them too haha almost all questions answered there right? Everything clear? Fantastic! Questions next time alrighty then?! Haha got plenty more where that came from if you want any more just ask away buddy!! Haha off ya go~So long~"</p><p><End Log></p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-592 is currently scheduled for interrogation.</p><p><strong>Incident 592-1:</strong> On 00/11/2014, SCP-592 breached its containment cell using a small, unidentifiable projectile. The projectile was found embedded in the skull of one of the two guards assigned to SCP-592. The projectile has been recovered and is currently being cleaned by Foundation surgeons onsite.</p><p>SCP-592\'s response to this incident was immediate and consisted of a series of simple vocalizations consisting of an exclamation of "Nooo!!!!" followed by an additional "Nooooo!!!!" over a period of fifteen minutes.</p><p>The following is a transcript of the audio recording recovered from SCP-592 at the time of the incident:</p><p>Noo! Noo! Noo! Noo!</p><p>Nooo! Noo! Noo! Noo!!</p><p>Nooo! Noo! Noo! Noo!</p><p>Nooooo Noooo! Nooo! Noooo!</p><p>Nooooo Noooo! Nooo! Noooo!</p><p>Noo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo nooo noooo!!!</p><p><End Log></p>
