<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-855</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-855 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at site-819. SCP-855 may only be accessed by personnel with a valid SCP-855 key. Any personnel attempting to open SCP-855 without such a key will be terminated via lethal injection. Any individual possessing knowledge of SCP-855's location may also request to undergo testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-855 is a corner shop located in █████, United Kingdom. The object's front facade is indistinguishable from that of any other retail establishment. Upon entering the building, however, the subject will be met with an empty shop; no merchandise or employees are present.</p><p>SCP-855 has been in this state for as long as the Foundation has had knowledge of it. Despite no one having ever visited SCP-855 in person, detailed diaries and records have been found detailing their interactions with SCP-855. One such diary, discovered in ███████, contained entries made by ██████████ ██████ (D-73626), a prior anomalous item subject.</p><p>The following is transcribed from the diary:</p><p>I sat down at my usual spot when a bell rang above my head and a man walked through the door. A rich aroma wafted from him, like fresh baked bread. I was delighted when I saw he was carrying treats for me to enjoy! I pulled out my wallet, only for him to hand over his own wallet instead and tell me to keep the change. I was more than happy to pay for these delicious treats! He told me his name was Mr █████████.</p><p>After that day, I would always watch this door whenever I could. I'd crane my neck slightly to make sure he didn't disappear again; that he'd stay in front of his shop forever, making customers happy all day long. But one day he wasn't there anymore. When I looked up at the clock on the wall, it was a full hour later than usual. He hadn't come back like he normally did, but I thought nothing of it because Mr █████████ always kept an eye on us little people like us - or perhaps 'we,' if we get old - even after late night shifts went past midnight and we went to bed early [Author has unspecified condition]. My mother would always tease me about staying up late when I had homework to do, but she never knew how hard it was for me to sleep when he wasn't around.</p><p>Eventually, one night after my shift ended at 3 AM, I decided to find out why Mr █████████ never came back anymore; he hadn't been seen or heard from in months now. It was just supposed to be an observation visit before my shopping trip tomorrow morning, but somehow everything changed when those handsome eyes met mine.</p><p>He asked me if there were any special requests I needed done today while he stood behind his counter. In a desperate attempt to avoid work another day longer than needed, what else do you think? He assured me that he was fully capable of meeting all my needs. He told me his name; something different every time I visited him - Gregor? Frederick? Jake? - but they all sounded warm and welcoming nonetheless. Despite being tired now that we were alone together - tired of scurrying around between meetings and meetings with customers who wanted things done right away - I couldn't help but feel something inside me sparkle with joy every time he spoke those pearls of gold again into my ears… No work for another day sounded so enticing now! Why didn't I know about this place sooner? What else could there be that makes life well worth living? "Is there anything else you would like?" he asked suddenly from behind the counter while gently brushing back loose strands of my hair that had fallen across my face when I leaned back into his shoulder for comfort (as if!), making me unintentionally sigh happily as well… "There's nothing else here," replied Mr █████████ as he gently continued brushing through them until they returned to their proper place behind my ear again afterwards "…and yet… there is." And then his lips were upon mine…</p><p>I don't really remember much of the kiss itself other than his lips felt soft like cotton candy against mine while they tasted sweet like honey dripping off freshly picked flowers on a sunny summer morning during spring break in your hometown… or some such nonsense thing like that… but let's not forget that sweet smell which enveloped us both once our tongue wrapped around each other's foreheads and pulled back so we could look into each other's eyes again after it… And those eyes… They looked so deep inside of me when they stared deeply into mine while our tongues were still entangled together in such a way but then began swimming its way through every part of my being until they reached its destination where they stopped moving… And stayed still…. For a while… …I can still vaguely remember how beautiful they looked swimming through half-closed eyelids… …but wait…. Did they leave just now? Did their beautiful eyes momentarily open only to stare at me now? Did their watery membranes close again now that their gaze trailed off somewhere far away over two miles away? Did their beautiful eyes finally come back towards mine once more just as quickly as they left away before only to be lost within mine again once more before closed again for good this time before finally leaving once more just as fast as it appeared before opening again during all of this? Had we exchanged signals or whatever with our eyes somewhere along the way only to be misinterpreted by others around us as worry or concern or sadness or all three at once? …Oh god what am I talking about...?</p><p>Oh yeah… That wonderful sweet scent grew stronger upon moving our lips away from each other's and taking several small steps backwards towards the countertop where Mr █████████ had left his money box after reaching behind him to take off his apron before placing it neatly on top of it – oh crap what am I thinking?! – before cradling himself against it again while lovingly gazing down at me with his remaining magnificent eyes – no longer glowing but radiating mere light – and said three little words which froze time itself right where it stands right here right now: "Would you like some tea?"</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-855 was discovered after a raid on the home of ██████████ ██████ (D-73626), a former anomalous item subject. The latter had been carrying a number of diaries regarding his experiences with SCP-855, which she had found during her recovery.</p><p>Due to the lengthy nature of D-73626's journals, SCP-855's initial containment procedures were temporarily suspended following this discovery. However, after several months of testing, SCP-855 proved to be harmless and no longer required its original special containment procedures."]</p>
