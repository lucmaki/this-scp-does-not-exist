<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-821</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-821 is to be contained at a HMC facility in a temperature controlled, server-free environment. Access to SCP-821 requires written permission of the current Head of Department. The area containing SCP-821 is to be guarded by two security personnel with Class D clearance or above. In the event that something exits SCP-821 while an instance of SCP-821-1 is still inside, said object is to be removed and stored in the same manner as instances of SCP-821-1.</p><p>Any unauthorised persons attempting to enter SCP-821 are to be detained by Security until a D-class personnel has disengaged from SCP-821. At no point may any D-class personnel attempt to become physically connected to SCP-821 or instances of SCP-821-1. All efforts are to be made in separating said D-class from their bodies as quickly as possible.</p><p>No personnel are to ever stand within one hundred meters of SCP-821. If a personnel who has not been briefed by their supervisor attempts to do so, they are to be detained for psychiatric evaluation. All interactions between staff who have not been fully briefed on SCP-821 must be recorded and reviewed by all current members of the HMC, including the Director of Site ████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-821 is a server module, manufactured by █████ ████ in 1994. The purpose of the manufacturing company’s website at that time was to allow users to transfer their computing equipment from one location to another.</p><p>Any object which has been physically connected to a computing device and has been active for more than thirty seconds will be transferred into SCP-821 if any part of said object is within three hundred meters of SCP-821. These objects are designated instances of SCP-821-1.</p><p>Instances of SCP-821-1 gain sentience after thirty seconds and will attempt to exit SCP-821 through any available duct openings. If an instance of SCP-821-1 exits, it will continue until it reaches a populated area or a covered structure. A thin layer of transparent substance, referred to as “SCP-821-2”, will form upon contact with air and solidify in the presence of blood and oxygen. Manifestations of SCP-821-2 are malleable and can be shaped into weapons, tools, or other similar tools to aid in escape.</p><p>All instances of SCP-821-1 know about each other and do not appear afraid of each other. In addition, all instances know how to speak English and have since being “evicted” from their original homes.</p><p>Instances of SCP-821-1 may not enter their original homes unless they are able to move around freely and the inhabitants are not conscious. Instances were observed attempting to capture those asleep at home before moving into the house undetected.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
