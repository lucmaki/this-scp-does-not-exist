<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-877</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-877's recording equipment and instruments are stored in a lock-free storage unit at Site 36. Personnel entering the storage unit must wear ear protectors, and be kept at least 6 meters away from any part of the storage unit at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-877 was originally a civilian emergency response unit in the city of Changsha, China. All members of SCP-877 have since died of natural causes or otherwise disappeared, their bodies now having been cremated and disposed of in accordance with Chinese law.</p><p>Since it was first found, SCP-877 has been recorded at various locations in the United States, where the band still performs at locations on the East Coast. The song "Bomb Squad" is part of SCP-877's repertoire.</p><p>SCP-877 does not appear to require sleep or rest, instead recharging its instruments at night by itself. When not performing music, SCP-877 appears to be perfectly normal human beings, though it will usually wander around during the night leading investigators to believe that it has no preset destination.</p><p>SCP-877 will often randomly stop performing during performances and will begin "jamming" with other individuals. It may also sit down on the ground for extended periods of time and will sometimes place a microphone in front of itself and begin singing along to its own music for prolonged periods of time without any discernable pattern. When performing with others, SCP-877 will sometimes take on various roles within their performance. It will play drums when others are playing guitar, sings while others are singing bass or keyboards, and may even play multiple instruments at once. Some performers appear unable to tell what is happening as they are under the effect of SCP-877's effects. During performances, SCP-877 is susceptible to loud noises and can be injured if it drops an instrument or is struck by any object while performing or practicing.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of an interview with SCP-877.</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-877</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ██████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview took place at Site 36.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Good evening, SCP-877.</p><p><strong>SCP-877:</strong> Hey, doc. How\'s it going?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> I\'m fine, thank you. Please state your name for the record.</p><p><strong>SCP-877:</strong> Alright. My name\'s Liu Han.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> And what do you do here?</p><p><strong>SCP-877:</strong> We\'re a band, see? We play music.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> I see. What sorts of music do you play?</p><p><strong>SCP-877 [nervously]:</strong> Um… mostly rock and punk, I guess.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Do you have a band name?</p><p><strong>SCP-877:</strong> [Pauses] Yeah, we\'re called "Bomb Squad."</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Why did you decide to call yourselves that?</p><p><strong>SCP-877 [nervously]:</strong> [Pause] \'Cause we were the bomb squad! That\'s it! We were the bomb squad! Man, we were awesome! We were the best band in the city, and we were gonna blow up! We were gonna go on tour and be awesome!</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> [Pauses] Please continue your story. Tell me what happened to you after the concert. What day did everything stop?</p><p><strong>SCP-877 [nervously]:</strong> [Exhales sharply] After the concert, we went to grab some drinks and snacks, right? Then when we came out, some people were just standing there like they didn\'t know what to do! They just stood there and looked at us like they were waiting for something to happen or like they wanted to start a riot or something! So we decided to stand up for ourselves, you know? We stood up in defense of our band and our city. But then… someone started yelling at us from the back of the crowd, and he was pointing his finger at me and he said… he said… GODDAMN IT!!! HE SAID "YOU\'RE NOT THE BOMB SQUAD!" THE REAL BOMB SQUAD IS GOING TO DIE IN A FEW HOURS AND YOU\'RE NOT EVEN HERE TO SEE IT, YOU FUCKHEADS!!!" But… but I was there! I was there when we got there! And I was there when we played our last song! And I didn\'t leave, but I wasn\'t the real bomb squad! And I tried to tell him that, but he wouldn\'t listen, he just yelled at me over and over again until finally everyone else started getting mad at him! They all started getting mad at him because they knew he was wrong, and they all came up behind him and they started beating him in the head with their instruments until they dropped them on the ground, and then they all beat him until he was dead! But he didn\'t die right away; he just sat there with a look of complete shock on his face before he finally went limp, and everyone stood around him with their instruments in their hands looking shocked that they killed someone! Everyone was really upset about it for a while \'cause no one really likes killing people; it\'s not polite or anything and it\'s really bloody if you ask me, but it doesn\'t matter \'cause that\'s what happened and that\'s what I saw so that\'s what I told everyone else so…. so that\'s how we got our name, by the way.']</p>
