<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-369</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-369 is stored in a standard containment locker in Site-77's Safe SCP Vault. The Object's anomalous properties do not alter over time, so seasonal maintenance is not required.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-369 is an anomalous registry book that contains handwriting of over 2100 items, including most major historical and fictional figures. The entries in SCP-369 are written in English and seem to function as a catalogue or encyclopedia of items, devoting several pages to the designation and description of objects (including items not comprehensible by humans, such as SCP-148). SCP-369 has been determined to be non-anomalous; it appears to have been created using commercial software packages, with no evidence of tampering or anomalous vectors.</p><p>Each entry chronicles the item's existence at approximately the date of each entry.</p><p>Additions to SCP-369 are recorded in red ink, with entries from the past remaining unchanged. However, new entries appear instantaneously upon creation.</p><p>New entries include original information about the item in question (such as the inventor), a one-sentence description, and the date of the item's debut into popular culture. If an entry describes a fictionalised version of an object (such as SCP-229), it will contain a link to a copy of the object's page in SCP-971, a similar book that records fictionalised versions of objects (see Addendum 369A)1 . Entries do not record anything about these fictionalised objects beyond their appearance in fiction; they do not possess gameplay mechanics, skill requirements or other properties of known Foundation objects.</p><p>The "Living Additions" section appears next to each entry (see Addendum 369B). These items were originally non-anomalous additions to chronological records (e.g., watches, drugs and various cures). However, since additions were added onto older entries rather than being manufactured into older entries themselves, they ended up existing simultaneously within both timelines. As such, some living additions originated outside of human knowledge, such as:</p><p>Several living additions appear to be composites - they are composed on paper by combining two original items from different periods of time. Examples include:</p><p>Many living additions are duplicates - several living additions share the same image or feel identical but differ in text. Examples include:</p><p>Additional Paraobjects and History Items:</p>
