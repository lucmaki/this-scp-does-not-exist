<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-434</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-434 is to be contained within a standard high-security containment locker at Site-██. Access to the item is restricted to Level 3 security personnel. Any personnel attempting to enter an area containing SCP-434 must first be screened for amnestic drugs and psychological issues. If a Level 4 security clearance is required, subject is to be escorted to the testing chamber by two (2) D-Class personnel at least 1.3 m (4 ft) away from the object. Testing for SCP-434 must be approved by a Level 3 or higher staff member, in writing, before any testing begins.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-434 is a briefcase, approximately 87x37x24cm (36x16x9in), bearing a seal similar to that of the [REDACTED] Company. When opened, the seal will display an image of the object's living cargo within a 2.5 meter radius. As long as the image remains, those viewing the briefcase instantly possess information pertaining to said subject. Subjects with implanted knowledge are not affected by SCP-434.</p><p>The exact effect of this object on other personnel has yet to be determined; testing has shown that D-Class and higher personnel do not have a complete knowledge of their captives, but it is unknown whether High-level staff or civilians are affected as well.</p><p>SCP-434 was contained in Site-██ after an incident involving its usage in Foundation interrogation tactics resulted in two agents being permanently disabled. Samples of the substance were also isolated and developed into a class-A amnestic and ██ other individuals were given mild behavioral alterations.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Incident 434-0</p><p>On ██/██/████, a female Agent was caught by a Foundation security patrol and brought to the nearest medical facility. Upon investigation, it was discovered that SCP-434\'s effect had "altered" her memories; she was aware of the events that transpired at Site-██. The briefcase was immediately detained by security personnel and all personnel were issued Class-B amnestics. A class-B amnestic was also administered to their escort.</p><p>Following this incident, SCP-434 has been identified as a Class-D priority item for research purposes. In light of current developments, the item is to remain contained indefinitely.</p>
