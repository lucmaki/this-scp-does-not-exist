<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-849</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-849 is to be kept in a locked safe and protected from contamination or damage in its entirety. No personnel are permitted to have direct contact with SCP-849 without Level 2/849 clearance.</p><p>Any subjects found with significant amounts of SCP-849 in their possession are to be detained, placed on a high-calorie diet, and given Class B amnestics. They are then to be given the appropriate amount of SCP-849 via injection.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-849 is a small bar of chocolate, approximately 2 cm by 1.5 cm and 0.5 cm thick, with the ability to alter its physical form from solid to liquid or back repeatedly. Its liquid and solid states are not distinguishable by touch, but are instead easy to detect via any non-invasive means.</p><p>When consumed in its liquid state, SCP-849 will activate the subject's digestive system, cooking and preparing the food for consumption intimately provided the subject is of an appropriate size and weight. This process will last anywhere between 45 minutes and 3 hours depending on the subject and the amount being consumed at once. The accelerated processing time allows for greater amounts of food to be consumed within a shorter timeframe. Food prepared this way will retain its taste and texture as normal, with only minor differences that can be detected only by trained professionals (see Addendum 849-P).</p><p>When consumed in its solid state, SCP-849 will allow for the intake of nutrients despite their normally being indigestible or unpalatable. When ingested in sufficient quantities, these nutrients will stimulate the production of glucose within the subject's body tissue at unprecedented levels due to extreme proximity and contact (see Addendum 849-I). If not stopped, this process can lead to excessive proliferation of cell tissue and bodily fluid until death (see Addendum 849-II). While it is nearly impossible for an individual to die from digestion alone as long as they have access to water, this may occur if multiple sources of SCP-849 are available at once.</p><p>Subjects discontinue SCP-849 consumption after two weeks unless given additional substances; however, they often continue to consume SCP-849 at irregular intervals once they recover. Testing has shown that subjects subjected to SCP-849's effects develop severe cravings associated with many foods more commonly eaten by humans than livestock. These cravings remain even after all other sources of nutrition are eliminated. Attempts to reestablish nutritional needs through food substitution have proven ineffective; followup testing with dosing with Replication 849-R has also been unsuccessful.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 849-P:</strong> List of foods known to be affected by SCP-849</p><p>Approximately half the foods on this list are meats; however, due to the nature of SCP-849's effects, it has been impossible to determine whether other types of meat are affected in the same way as livestock. The lack of potentially harmful side effects associated with SCP-849 may indicate that many more types of food are affected than listed here."]</p>
