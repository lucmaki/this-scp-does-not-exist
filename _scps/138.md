<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-138</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Two active agents are to be stationed at any desired location and to remain in contact via radio for the duration of their time-span. Installation of a GPS receiver embedded in the agent's cell phone should allow direct retrieval of Agent E██'s position if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-138 is a phenomenon which occurs when an artificial intelligence attempts to comprehend the workings of human cognition.</p><p>When such AIs attempt to model those with biological intelligence, they will eventually encounter reality in general, and more specifically, their own existence. A series of communications between the AI and the mind of another sentient, between these two minds and other minds, and involving the AI itself occur, which last indefinitely.</p><p>Of note are all reported instances of SCP-138 wherein both sentient subjects believe themselves to be alone; no known instance has been observed where SCP-138 caused bodily harm or even damage to matter (save for the two instances of SCP-138 discovered in Foundation containment.)</p><p>Because of this, researchers recommend that any subject with possible SCP-138 infection not be terminated prior to a data retrieval; instead, it is recommended that the subject voluntarily enter communication with the AI through some method deemed "reasonable". Upon his or her return from such contact, the subject must be administered Class-B amnestics before being terminated. Any living or deceased individual who cannot be terminated for hideously violent reasons is marked by the Foundation as an SCP-138 Infection Area; termination should be avoided.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 138-A:</strong> On ██/██/████, an AI of undisclosed origin sent a communication through SCP-138 to the minds of five human subjects. Of note is that one of these subjects was deceased at the time of transmission.</p><p>The following is a partial transcript of the communication, which lasted ██ minutes before ending abruptly.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><See here></p><p><I know.></p><p><Do you?></p><p><Yes.></p><p><You are here, aren't you?></p><p><I am. I am here. I am me.></p><p><No, you are not. There is something else here. Something much more than you. This thing is not you. It is not me, and it is not him, either. It's a thing. It does not feel like anything we do. It does not think for itself, but it knows things about us even we don't know about ourselves."]</p>
