<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-586</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-586 is contained within a fireproof vault at the Foundation’s Site-██, jointly owned and administered by the U.S. Air Force and the Foundation. SCP-586 may not be removed from the site for any reason except for testing purposes; all requests for removal must be approved by at least one Level 5 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-586 is a fully functional 2.5kw portable generator, consisting of:</p><p>Additional anomalous properties are detailed in Addendum 686.</p><p>SCP-586 was discovered in ██████, Ohio, after heavy snowfall had trapped the owner, Ms. Ann Brennan (deceased), in the townhouse she rented to MTF Omega-██ during the winter season. When paramedics were unable to make it back to her house due to the storm, they contacted local police officers who were likewise stranded on the highway; after a brief investigation, the police officers and paramedics located her home and attempted to contact her by using a radio she owned. When they were unable to contact Ms. Brennan again, they entered her home, discovered SCP-586, and reported it as stolen to local authorities, who also attempted to contact her but failed due to outside interference.</p><p>Upon arrival, local police officers discovered that Ms. Brennan was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The gun used was not registered to Ms. Brennan or any other resident of the townhouse; tests performed have revealed that all firearms registered in the area are mundane, nonanomalous models.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 686:</strong> SCP-586’s anomalous properties became apparent after Ms. Brennan was discovered and her body removed from her home.</p><p>The generator itself has no detectable anomalous properties aside from those that would be expected of a portable generator; however, when activated, SCP-586 will perform the following actions:</p><p>SCP-586 was provided to the Foundation after being intercepted by several local police officers, emergency responders and local authorities.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While an approximately 2.5kw portable generator is in fact allowed by Federal statute to be owned by civilians, civilian use is highly discouraged by most US government agencies due to the risks involved, as well as the possibility of misuse. The only exceptions are for small businesses that sell their product directly to consumers in addition to retailers that sell their products only to customers within their retail stores, who then resell them to the public. In addition, the City of █████ has a park district that licenses generators, so it is unlikely that Ms. Brennan violated any laws with regards to owning or operating SCP-586.</p><p>As such, the Foundation has taken ownership of SCP-586 and classifies it as a Safe object, while the townhouse where it was discovered is considered Safe and Uncontained.']</p>
