<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-870</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-870 is to be kept in a Safe Object Locker, located within Site-71. Access to SCP-870 is restricted to Level 4 and above personnel. Any and all instances of SCP-870 are to be stored as separate sites and marked with an individual Marker.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-870 is a black Mitsubishi Lancer, styled as an US-specification R-G Unit 2. All components of the vehicle are made in Japan. The vehicle's external appearance is identical to that of an R-G Unit 1, with the exception of the vehicle's markings.</p><p>When powered on, SCP-870 displays intelligence comparable to that of an immature human child (roughly equivalent to a six year old human), using no more than half a dozen words. Using its auxiliary batteries, SCP-870 is capable of staying active for up to 160 hours before the need to charge its batteries resolves itself.</p><p>When activated and having the proper language inputs, SCP-870 will answer all questions asked on the topic of war or combat through nonverbal responses, such as pointing and gesturing. If a subject asks SCP-870 what military vehicles it can operate, or what weapons it has at its disposal, SCP-870 will respond with a list describing various Japanese military vehicles and their weaponry. The responses and content have been recorded and translated by personnel.</p><p>Interview Log 870/1</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>(Dr. █████ ██████████) Interviewer: Dr. ██████████</p><p>(SCP-870) Subject: SCP-870</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Dr ██████████: What military vehicles do you use?</p><p>SCP-870: [nods] [gestures]</p><p>Dr ██████████: What weapons would you use?</p><p>SCP-870: [nods] [points towards Dr ███'s hands and vocalizes 'fire'] [extends his arms to demonstrate firing capability], "fire" (indicating firearms) [shoots a small pistol he is holding].</p><p>Dr ██████████: How many soldiers do you have under your command? Are they occupied with something else?</p><p>SCP-870: [nods] [pointing at Dr █████'s hand] "soldier" (indicating Dr ███) [gestures] "warrior" (indicating Captain █████). "fight". "battle".

"[spots me standing in front of vehicle]" "(gestures)"</p><p>Dr ██████████: You are looking for a place where you can fight? Where have you been fighting until now? Where are you going? Why are you here? Who are you fighting against? Have they defeated you yet? Are they coming to get you now? What do you fight for? To win? To survive? With whom or what are you going to win today against this battle? What do you think about when fighting against this battle? What does the battle sound like to you when it's talking about there's nothing else out there besides the battle against your enemy even when others come running over from other places telling them about new battles to be fought away from their home not bringing any news about the recent victory that was won back home where aren't as bloody or violent because they're not risking anything just staying alive smartly than risking their life in order to protect their homeland from foreign invaders which don't seem like much compared too us but for us we give everything for our homeland which we had been living since birth until now without fail without any regrets so we must fight! We must win! It's our duty! It's our reason for being born! For us who have already been sacrificed everything leaving behind nothing except our blood spilled tears annals righteous traditions families homes souls honor and pride family names while they've left nothing behind but behind empty shelves empty words still clinging onto their past achievements cursing those that came before them who shouldn't even exist anymore much less make them feel proud because those hands that were once noble couldn't save everyone now that could be stopped were finally defeated stopping them from hurting us anymore wondering how much longer will it take for them to realize how perfect this day is since they'll never be together again after this time comes only remembering each other thinking of how each other is most probably going through hard times right now because of us still fighting same enemies each one fighting alone but too afraid too admit defeat being afraid of losing themselves they're too afraid too admit defeat so they continue fighting which isn't fair nor right but if I should die then it wouldn't matter because I die knowing we succeeded it would be worth dying trying even if I'm killed completely we'll always have each other together forever after this time comes only remembering each other thinking of how each other is most probably going through hard times right now because <end log></p>
