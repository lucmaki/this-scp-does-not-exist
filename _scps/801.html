<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-801</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-801 must be stored, handled and transported as a liquid. The object should be kept in an opaque container, preferably one with a percentage of glass matching that of the object itself. In the absence of such containers, it is recommended to use [REDACTED]. A minimum of two security personnel are to remain on stand-by outside the container and are not permitted to leave without closure.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-801 is a liquid substance composed of 83% normal gaseous hydrocarbons (HC), and 17% nitrogen. It exhibits no physical characteristics that would allow it to be separated from its liquid state, nor can it be contained in any form beyond its liquid state by means of containment procedures used with standard gases. SCP-801 is also not an explosive or flammable substance, despite the fact that it may still ignite when loosely piped, as shown in experiments.</p><p>SCP-801 has the unique ability to combine with anything combustible, such as wood, coal, petroleum products, wood chip shavings and other hydrocarbon-based materials and release nitroguanidine (NG2). NG2 is a highly flammable gas that combines with oxygen to cause flame, smoke and explosions.</p><p>The compound is especially effective on organic matter and water-based objects, most notably on plants. SCP-801 does not burn itself with combustion; however, if ignited on an appropriate surface, it will combine with the air to produce explosive nitroguanidine gas.</p><p>SCP-801 was originally retrieved from the ████████ Chemical Corporation located in Chicago which had been investigating methods of using hydrocarbon gases to develop new forms of weaponry rather than propellants or explosives. During testing, SCP-801 was accidentally discovered by one of the plant's workers and recovered by local authorities.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>Before attempting to publish the following information, please read the following from Dr. ████.</p><p>Dear Containment Team,</p><p>I have been asked to report on the properties of SCP-801 which appear to be unique among all known compounds. This is a report submitted by Dr. ██████, a colleague of mine at the Department of Chemistry. For simplicity\'s sake, I will refer to Dr. ██████ by his initials, "J." and we will refer to the substance by its designation SCP-801, in order to prevent having to repeat myself.</p><p>J: SCP-801 seems to have no real characteristics that could be utilized, or even understood by any kind of laboratory testing. It has no smell, produces no vapors when it is flammable for any other reason than an ignition source, and does not conduct electricity or produce heat in any form. It does not react with any other substances, nor does it appear to absorb any of the substances it comes into contact with. Finally, it does not appear to be made up of any elements from our periodic table, and is unlikely to be synthesized.</p><p>In short, the substance is an unknown compound that cannot be understood or identified by any form of conventional means, and is therefore classified as an abnormal anomaly.</p><p>I am including a copy of a letter from Dr. ██████ to the Chicago Field Office regarding SCP-801 covering the same issues and conclusions as this report. I will also include a copy of another report I submitted on the same subject, but dated earlier today. I am willing to release this information confidentially in order to obtain more information on SCP-801 and its properties.']</p>
