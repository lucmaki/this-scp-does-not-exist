<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-985</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe (restricted access</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-985 is kept at Site-22's Safe SCP wing, where it is to be stored in a standard storage locker. Testing of SCP-985 requires the approval of at least one Level 3 security clearance. SCP-985 must be kept as far away from other items as possible to prevent accidental activation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-985 is a 4.5 cm x 5 cm x 0.5 cm piece of tooth (Fossorium incisum) with a simplistic design and no markings. Despite its small size, it functions as a fully functional toothbrush, albeit one which requires the user to apply some force in order to brush effectively.</p><p>When a human subject brushes their teeth with SCP-985, they will report feeling a sensation similar to that of brushing their teeth with an antiseptic dental floss product. They will also report the impression of a white, angular surface beneath the subject's tongue. The subject will also report that they feel sharp pains, similar to those felt by manual extraction or dental implants.</p><p>If an individual brushes their teeth with SCP-985 while they are under the influence of substances such as alcohol or sedatives, they will experience no effect; however, if they brush their teeth while sober, they will claim that they feel as though their teeth have been "cleaned".</p><p>While it has not been possible to determine whether or not SCP-985 is an actual part of the human body, it does appear to be "naturally" formed from one individual's tooth at some point in time.</p>
