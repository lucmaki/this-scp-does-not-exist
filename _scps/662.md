<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-662</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As the area covered by SCP-662 is relatively small, regular patrols are sufficient in addressing any incidents. Under no circumstances are civilian vehicles permitted to enter this area. No civilian vehicles are allowed to be rented or transported through the city to avoid a possible leak of information. Security personnel are to check all license plates and vehicles entering SCP-662 for any signs of an anomalous object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-662 is an area covering a two block radius around Murfreesboro Pike and Skyline Drive in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. It is located within the town of Smyrna, TN. There are no distinguishing characteristics aside from its anomalous nature.</p><p>Any vehicle entering SCP-662 will experience all objects moving at a slow speed. Some objects such as animals will become visible, but this effect is only noticeable when the vehicle itself is moving at a relatively slow speed. Low speeds at which the object becomes visible to the driver are difficult to observe, and objects appear to be flitting in and out of existence depending on the speed of the vehicle.</p><p>This effect can be circumvented with high speeds however. In this manner vehicles traveling above 60 mph displays the effect, though it is not as pronounced as at low speeds. The closure of Smyrnna Drive has somewhat negated this effect, but even at idle speeds other cars display this effect too.</p><p>At all times while driving within SCP-662, the front license plate on any stationary or moving vehicles can be seen in full detail by anyone with a view directly behind them (see Addendum). This area appears to have been specifically designed for surveillance purposes with several decoy stars placed on rooftops along with several "give way" signs leading up to and into the anomaly.</p>
