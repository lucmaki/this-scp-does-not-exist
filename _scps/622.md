<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-622</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-622 is to be kept in a secure, soundproof chamber, located within Site-17. Three security guards are to be stationed outside the chamber at all times. Any persons attempting to enter or leave the chamber are to be forcibly detained and interrogated for details regarding the SCP-622 anomaly. If persons diagnosed with SCP-622 are discovered, they are to be released; following a period of quarantine, they shall be relocated to a site outside the continental United States.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-622 is a semi-functional three story residence located in Tucson, Arizona. The SCP-622 anomaly manifests only when an individual living within the United States or Canada attempts to access SCP-622. When an individual dwelling outside of these regions attempts to enter the residence, through any means, the anomaly does not manifest.</p><p>Upon successful access within the house, subjects will be unable to remember anything prior to entering SCP-622. They will appear to age at a rate equivalent to that of a human being experiencing regular restful sleep (see Test Log 622-A). Lifespan will be affected proportionally with their distance from SCP-622. Persons living within 20 km of SCP-622 have been observed to be significantly more distressed than persons who reside farther away; however, no clinical symptoms have been reported by those residents. Testing of time dilation in this manner is currently prohibited due to potential risk of harm to personnel.</p><p>On the fifth floor, between 11:00 and 13:00, any individual entering the residence reports hearing a faint chorus of "He's cuh-uute" spoken in an unidentifiable language. This phenomenon ceases when individuals leave SCP-622 after this time period elapses.</p>
