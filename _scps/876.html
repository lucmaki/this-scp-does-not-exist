<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-876</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-876 is to be kept within a sealed storage vault, kept from direct light and humidity by plexiglass windows.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-876 is a carved wooden rod, approximately 30 cm in length. The markings found on the surface of SCP-876 appear to have been burnt into it with a branding iron.</p><p>Upon inserting the rod into any written text, the marking on its surface will illuminate as if in response to the speaker. This response varies depending on the medium used, but typically involves an anagram, any combination of the words ‘good’ and ‘evil’, or an opaque statement regarding each combination.</p><p>SCP-876 was recovered from a museum display case in [REDACTED]. The description on the case label claims SCP-876 to be "Bupinadhi Wood: The Source & Source Book of Wisdom".</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Test Log 876-1</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> [REDACTED]</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> [DO NOT ENTER NAME]</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Written text</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> A selection of anagrams and combinations of the words 'good' and 'evil' were provided.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Unusual response. Most responses were worded as deflections, but this response was more abstract in nature.</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> [REDACTED]</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> [DO NOT ENTER NAME]</p><p><strong>Medium:</strong> Written text</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> A selection of anagrams and combinations of the words 'good' and 'evil' were provided.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Unusual response.

Response ‘A’ is similar to one of the results from test log #876-1, with the exception of being more inscrutable, even for a response. It reads as follows:</p><p>A thought is a thought; it is not always good or evil. Thought itself is neutral. However, thoughts can be used to create an entity of power and destruction. And such entities are not always good or evil. Sometimes they can be both good and evil at once, depending on their actions.</p><p>It is believed that this response is encoded within a previously unknown language or dialect. A similar response was also recovered from the home of Dr. ████ ███, though that one was written in English.</p>
