<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-34</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-34 is to be held in a standard containment locker at Site-77. Two (2) guards are to be posted outside the containment cell at all times. SCP-34 is to be fed one (1) gallon of water per day, and supplied with cat litter twice a week as part of its maintenance regimen. Any attempts at escape by SCP-34 are to be immediately dealt with via lethal force, as this will deter similar actions in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-34 appears to be the corpse of a large, adult female canine with brownish fur. SCP-34's eyes are open and glassy, and it has a constant, low level of muscular tremors; some of these tremors occur during periods of inactivity. SCP-34 is capable of locomotion on its own, but has yet to make any attempt to do so. It does appear to recognize the presence of humans, and will stand to allow them to approach. SCP-34 can also respond verbally; however, its vocalizations are incoherent and seem to be attempts at phrases or sentences.</p><p>For the past ██ years, SCP-34's anomalous properties have resulted in it being used as a "mop" in buildings around the Boston area. Though this was thought to be due to SCP-34's obvious death, it was confirmed that SCP-34 possesses a mild form of psychokinetic abilities similar to those of a poltergeist. This proves useful in cleaning floors without disturbing nonanomalous personnel, which is required by test subjects and researchers alike.</p><p>On rare occasions, black liquid will ooze out of the ears and nose of SCP-34. The nature of this fluid has never been determined; though it has been observed pouring out of open wounds sustained during SCP-34's time as a mop, as well as pores in its skin. Any attempts at analysis have proven useless; even when exposed to an electrolytic solution designed for live tissue samples, the unknown liquid remains essentially inert until after the wet surfaces are wiped clean. All biological specimens known to have been contacted by additional fluids from SCP-34 have turned blue and subsequently died.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum-34.1:</strong></p><p>The following is an eyewitness report of SCP-34's properties as a mop:</p><p>On █/██/████, SCP-34 was removed from containment for use in SCP-██. SCP-34 has grown agitated at the time of this writing, and it is unclear whether or not it will continue to be cooperative during future testing."]</p>
