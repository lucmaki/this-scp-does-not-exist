<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-471</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All persons of Caucasian descent within a hundred-kilometer radius of SCP-471 are to be officially registered as residents of a rural village in northern Thailand. Accordingly, those persons are to undergo the standard amnestic treatment method used in Foundation-sponsored programs for the resettlement of former members of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CKP) and Khmer Rouge (Khmer Rouge).</p><p>In addition to this vaccination program, medical examinations for skin cancer or melanoma are to be conducted on all persons in the designated zone. All cases found are to be submitted to a Foundation-appointed cancer specialist for analysis and treatment.</p><p>Procedures are to be completed by no later than 2073. For purposes of personnel training, the Foundation has established several training grounds in the region, wherein personnel may practice the application of biological weapons in a controlled environment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-471 is a location in northern Thailand, approximately 150 kilometers north of the city of Surat Thani. The exact coordinates are ██████ ██████ 17°███</p><p>According to local legends, the entrance to SCP-471 is always covered by thick, impenetrable jungle vegetation and an unmarked gate, which also serve as a gap in the otherwise unbroken jungle canopy. SCP-471 is currently 1.5 kilometers in width and 9 kilometers in length, although growth rates preclude measurement of the exact width or length beyond 1573.</p><p>The interior of SCP-471 consists entirely of a single paved road, lined with palm trees whose trunks are hollowed out. In addition, the ground throughout the entire region is largely made up of soft mud or sand (see Addendum 471-01).</p><p>The majority of individuals living in the area have been observed to have developed senile streaks and minor forms of skin cancer due to exposure to SCP-471's unique qualities. In particular, exposure to any part of the region for more than 1 day results in uncontrollable changes in the skin pigmentation of inhabitants, who will subsequently develop senile streaks and skin cancer at an accelerated rate.</p><p>Several former members of the CKP and Khmer Rouge have also been reported to experience similar effects after relocation to SCP-471.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 471-01:</strong> The following document was found on the body of a former member of the CKP, who was captured and interrogated during the initial Foundation investigation of ██████ ██████ 17°███.</p><p>Hello.</p><p>I suppose you've heard all about it by now: the Cambodia story. What a mess. The peasants are revolting, and we've got nothing to stop them but this old test tube of serum. I'm not even sure if it will work, but we've got to try.</p><p>How do you think this happened? After all, we were supposed to be the good guys, right? We're supposed to care about the freedom of the people, not just our own. Our mission was to bring freedom to the entire world.</p><p>I guess our mission was a lie, too. We were just in it for ourselves.</p><p>The rest of us have been here for 20 years. I've seen so many faces come and go, both Khmer Rouge victims and spies hiding themselves in our midst. But none of them have been like you. You're perfect in every way—except that you're dead. And you can't be with us anymore.</p><p>But I hope that you're happy now, wherever you are.</p><p>Thank you."]</p>
