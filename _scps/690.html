<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-690</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-690 is to be held within a 6.9m x 3m x 3m chamber. The walls are to be lined with non-conductive plastic, and the ceiling made of reinforced steel. The floor is composed of 1 cm granite tiles. The light source is to consist of 28 high wattage fluorescent tubes, which emit their light through a plate facing up, not directly into SCP-690's viewing area. Also, a switch must be installed in the wired entryway that will allow the staff to turn off the lights at night.</p><p>Containment guards are to be assigned two shifts each day, in which they will control all access to SCP-690's chamber. When not on duty, they are to sleep in shifts of three persons each, in order to prevent one person from sleeping on guard duty while the other sleeps. Three shift guards are required for each block of two hours, totaling 15 staff members per night.</p><p>Euclid personnel who have been tasked with SCP-690 containment are to undergo psychiatric evaluations every five years with no less than four (4) days between observations. They may only access SCP-690 once every year; during this time they may read or observe SCP-690 as much as they would like out of job performance. Observers should be shown no more than 20 minutes at a time; otherwise they may experience adverse effects such as insomnia and paranoia due to excess exposure.</p><p>Personnel assigned to SCP-690 containment are not allowed within 2 meters of SCP-690 unless accompanied by another guard. This allows for ease in moving personnel away from SCP-690 when necessary, as well as preventing undue proximity when not on duty. If a second guard is needed, it will be placed in an alternate location within the same room right outside SCP-690's viewing area; this is most likely as far away from the viewing area as possible but still within range of visual contact with SCP-690. If there is no other room within close proximity, one guard will stay next to the viewing area to ensure someone is currently observing SCP-690 over the course of an hour at a time. If it is found necessary, an extra guard can be placed inside the viewing space instead of standing in front of it.</p><p>Any person wishing to enter or leave the viewing chamber must first request and receive permission from the assigned guard present. Each request should normally take less than five minutes during non-duty times and no longer than ten minutes for duty hours. If a person or group enters or leaves without being given consent by an appointed guard within 5 minutes, he/she may, at the discretion of a member of security staff or higher, have his/her privileges suspended for 3 months or indefinitely (depending on severity). Their assignment to SCP-690 can also be terminated at any time if it is determined that their presence causes complications for containment procedures or affects the mental health of SCP-690's current occupants.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-690 is an Americanized Japanese humanoid, standing 2.20 meters tall and weighing approximately 121 kilograms, with a fore head length of 1.55m and a torso length of 2.00m. There is no facial or skeletal structure visible from the outside of SCP-690's containment chamber; however, from all other angles, its exterior surface resembles that of a human male aged 50-60 (as calculated according to DNA analysis) with short brown hair and hazel eyes. SCP-690 has what looks to be some type of military uniform with the rank of E-5 on its left arm; however it is unclear whether SCP-690 actually holds this rank or if this is just an external element added for aesthetic reasons.</p><p>When observed by other entities within its viewing range (15 square meters), SCP-690 will appear as if it is moving towards them while remaining stationary. This can cause others to experience mild hallucinations similar to those experienced by individuals under hypnosis or in states of sleep paralysis, though such effects are only temporary and do not affect the consciousness of the person observing; they will fully disappear after the 22 minute viewing period is over. When this effect was first witnessed in 1970, it took place in sections of ████ ██████, which has since been purchased by ████████ Corporation; until 1978 this land was owned by the Great Lakes Christian College in ████████████, Michigan. Further testing into SCP-689's ability to affect viewers outside its viewing area have proven inconclusive.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> In 1971, a ██████ student, ██████ ███████, had his eyes opened from sleep paralysis. When he attempted to scream, he could not produce any sound due to the fact that the window he was looking through was too small. He could see SCP-690 outside his window; however, he could not move or speak due to his paralysis. After several minutes of watching SCP-690 pass by his window, ██████ was able to move and yell out for help. The students in the room with him woke immediately, and the event was reported to the school's administration with security staff investigating the scene. ██████'s parents were notified and interviewed at their home, who confirmed that he had been talking to them in his sleep.</p><p>Mr. ███████ reported that they had not seen SCP-690 on their property before and that they had not heard any unusual noises coming from their son's room. On further investigation, it was found that the window used by ██████ was a standard one-way glass, allowing him to see out but not others. The glass was replaced with a thin sheet of plastic film, preventing further incidents.</p>
