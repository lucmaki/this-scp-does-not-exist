<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-354</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-354 is to be referenced in city development plans and researched by the Foundation. Municipalities within 200 km of SCP-354 are to incorporate no fewer than two units of SCP-354 within their road networks.</p><p>Appropriate containment vehicles, such as SCP-354-1 through SCP-354-12, are to be stored at a temperature and humidity level appropriate for long-term preservation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-354 is an off-site fuel and repair facility for automobiles operating on Germany's national autobahn network.</p><p>SCP-354 is a concrete bunker (55m x 20m x 10m) with a single entrance on the southern side. SCP-354 contains three gasoline pumps, one diesel pump, and at least one utility vehicle or motorcycle parked outside of each of the two main entrances. SCP-354 also contains a number of weapons, ammunition and emergency supplies.</p><p>SCP-354 is staffed by personnel wearing modified NATO uniforms made from heat-resistant materials and equipped with hazard protection clothing. The Foundation has determined that all members have been deceased for at least 60 years, although few of their identifying features have been preserved intact.</p><p>In addition to fueling its customers' vehicles, SCP-354 also stores spare parts for abandoned property and has one dedicated team of mechanics for maintaining vehicles during their regular intervals of operation. Customers are required to pay a fee before entering up to 120 km outside of SCP-354's service area.</p><p>It is unknown what motivates these individuals to work as they do; however, they have not attempted to escape containment despite several attempts by Foundation forces. At least three instances of SCP-354 occupants have been interviewed; however, none can provide any information regarding the purpose of SCP-354 aside from its location and maintenance services provided there.</p><p>SCP-354 was originally discovered after an obsolete electronic navigation system located within SCP-354 caused strange interference in areas away from SCP-354. Cross referencing suggested that the source of this interference was located along the M25 motorway corridor. It was later determined that SCP-354 may be involved in the location and preservation of numerous private automotive projects classified as anomalies by the Foundation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 354-01:</strong> Documentation of SCP-354</p><p>SCP-354 was originally discovered after an obsolete electronic navigation system located within SCP-354 caused strange interference in areas away from SCP-354. Cross referencing suggested that the source of this interference was located along the M25 motorway corridor. It was later determined that SCP-354 may be involved in the location and preservation of numerous private automotive projects classified as anomalies by the Foundation.</p><p>On ██/██/████, the following document was discovered at SCP-354. The document was written by a member of SCP-354's maintenance team prior to their deaths.</p><p>We've been working here for almost 3 years now, and it's gotten a little boring. There's nothing to do here but work. The boss lady says we're fine as long as we keep the work moving and stop talking about leaving.</p><p>I can't believe I'm writing this, but I'm bored. I'd love to have a job where I didn't have to take orders from some old biddy all day. I know that if I go back home, my mother will put me to work in the fields again, but it would be nice to be able to pick my own hours.</p><p>I'm just not cut out to be a farmer anymore for sure. If only I could get back on the road again! But you see, we're not allowed to leave SCP-354. We're supposed to stay here and work, no matter how much the boss lady yells at us when we don't get things done fast enough.</p><p>And what if we left? Wouldn't that just give the boss lady more time alone? There are worse places than this, you know. There must be some other place out there that she'd let us visit if we just asked her nicely enough.</p><p>Well, I guess there's nothing left to do but write this letter and hope that one of my family reads it sometime soon.</p>
