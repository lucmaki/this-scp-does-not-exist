<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-388</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-388 is kept in a 6m x 6m x 3m reinforced steel chamber, with an airlock and a Faraday cage. The chamber has been fitted with CCTV cameras. SCP-388 is vacuum-sealed transparent plastic tubing (30 mm diameter) in a sealed box; this has been attached to the top of SCP-388's chamber.</p><p>In addition to the above procedures, all websites advertising the construction of SCP-388 are to be redirected to this document. Mobile Task Force Omicron-76 ("Seraphim") is to be stationed at the location of any similar constructions. As long as SCP-388 remains functional, MTF Omicron-76 will investigate all new constructions discovered. No further containment procedures are required for SCP-388.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-388 is a mystical entity that manifests in any building or complex where it has direct contact with electricity. The building or complex appears to function normally after SCP-388 has entered; however, the entity will manifest itself wherever there is potential for electrical damage.</p><p>SCP-388's primary method of operation is through the application of highly concentrated sound frequencies produced by its anomalous auditory system. These sound frequencies are capable of penetrating steel walls and causing minor explosions if exposed to air. SCP-388's most common form of attack is emanating from a loudspeaker mounted on the roof of its containment chamber which releases blasts of sound at approximately 3x the maximum human hearing range (approximately 140 dB).</p><p>SCP-389 was discovered in [REDACTED], Illinois,USA on ██/██/██ when a new school had been constructed and opened for students on 01/08/████. During construction, evidence was found to indicate that a high power amplifier had been installed. This is believed to have been used either by a non-anomalous individual who had purchased the building, or by an anomalous entity to increase the output of its sonic attacks.</p><p>Interview 388-1:</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr. █████████: Good afternoon, [DATA EXPUNGED]. How are you finding your new home?</p><p>SCP-388: It's beautiful here, Doctor, thanks! I've never seen such lovely buildings before! Never seen so many flowers and rainbows! Can we go outside? I could really go for some fresh air right now…</p><p>Dr. █████████: Uh…sure? Why don't I take you outside first?</p><p>SCP-388: Alrighty then…errmmm..I can't see anything out there! What does this place look like? Keep talking! I'm bored over here~</p><p>Dr. █████████: Look around, check out this classroom over there. How about in that corner? Look over there and tell me what you see. Anywhere you feel comfortable looking, just check it out and tell me why you're looking there…I'll give you 30 seconds to do it.</p><p>SCP-388: Okay..what do y'all think this place looks like? Do we need a map to find our way around here? Can we get another newspaper or something so we can draw more things? Please??!!</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 388-A:</strong></p><p>SCP-388 has been fed with a daily ration of wheat and fruit after the interview, and is now behaving as normal. It is currently being kept in a large metal cage, which has previously been used to capture another SCP-████. SCP-388 has not been moved to a new location, although it will remain within 5\xa0km of the current location.']</p>
