<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-133</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-133 is currently contained in an isolated sealed room at Site-7. While the realm of SCP-133 remains inaccessible to all personnel, observation through a wireless camera has revealed that the ground does not rise significantly and the only significant change in temperature is caused by heat coming off of the human subjects inside the room. No change in air pressure is observed, suggesting that there may be some kind of extradimensional resistance present that prevents the subjects from leaving. A single humanoid subject is currently housed within SCP-133 awaiting testing; any additional subjects are to be kept until they have been subjected to Foundation mind control trauma therapy and returned to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-133 consists of a box, with the anomalous properties linked to it. Within the box is a statue resembling a human male, with the head removed. SCP-133 was discovered in ███████, ██████████ by local law enforcement during a raid on a known methamphetamine lab. When researchers examined the watermark on the box they found that ███████ █████’s name was also on it.</p><p>When a humanoid subject containing consciousness enters SCP-133, all other persons within close proximity will disappear. There has been at least one recorded case of mental transfer occurring without physical contact; though in this case, the previous subject was under the effects of narcotics, and had a subsequent dream that caused her to believe she had touched someone else's feet while sleeping. If no people are present upon entering SCP-133, the subject will begin to experience hellish visions from their own subconscious imagination (see Test Log 133.1). In some cases, these images can be disturbing enough to cause psychological trauma, especially if the subject experiences them repeatedly; these subjects will also report that every time they leave SCP-133 their beliefs about reality become distorted and their perception begins to change (see Test Log 133.2). Otherwise, subjects will continue on as normal with no further changes or problems experienced.</p><p>SCP-133 can only be opened by a living human being who fits the following criteria:</p><p>These tests were performed within an isolated sealed room at Site-7 in order to eliminate radiation as a possible factor in triggering its anomalous properties. A final test using live testing subjects was conducted on ██/██/2003 with three non-foundation personnel; once again, there were no deaths or any sign of exposure to radiation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 133.1:</strong> Test Log 133.1</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1203</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject entered SCP-133 and was instructed to remain within it for the duration of the test. After ten minutes, the subject was asked to write down any visual hallucinations they experienced during this time.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> The subject has been returned to their cell before further testing can be performed. - Dr. ████████</p>
