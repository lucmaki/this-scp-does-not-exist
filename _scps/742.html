<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-742</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-742 is contained in a reinforced, temperature-controlled chamber with a continuously running computer program designed to simulate Earth's climate (see Experiment Log 742). Due to the immense volume of data present in SCP-742, large storage arrays have been built in proximity to the facility housing it.</p><p>Testing involving SCP-742 must be authorized by level 4 personnel and must be performed under supervision from an appropriate specialist. Testing is only permitted for a total of one month out of every two years (e.g. three months between tests on 06/29/12 and 06/30/13). It should be noted that any requests for testing involving SCP-742 must be submitted in writing at least three days before the expiration date of the previous authorization. Any request without proper authorization or approval shall be met with immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-742 is a computer program, compiled in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and Microsoft Access 97, that simulates the climate of every day of the year between 1980 and present day (see Experiment Log 742). At the bottom of the screen is a message reading:</p><p>FOR TEST PURPOSES ONLY !!! THIS PROGRAM NO LONGER REQUIRES AUTHORIZATION !!! GOOD DAYS TO ALL!</p><p>To date, no one has managed to edit or otherwise alter SCP-742. Attempts to stop or terminate the simulation have been unsuccessful, showing no visible signs of stopping. SCP-742 appears to be in an endless loop, with no sign of stopping. SCP-742 will continue to run indefinitely until terminated by force.</p><p>SCP-742 was discovered on ██/██/20██ after an abandoned house in ███████, ██ caught fire due to a faulty electrical outlet. A group of local children stumbled upon the house while playing "doctor", whereupon they noticed an anomalous computer desk and proceeded to investigate it. Underneath the desk was found a black box labeled "PROGRAMMER" and several cables leading towards several computers and monitors; these were used to power the computer system which powered SCP-742. The children were able to disable much of this system before severing all power sources and leaving without incident (see document #████).</p><p>After destruction of the initial computer system, research began into exposing this system from within by programming it to simulate Earth's climate using non-anomalous software packages. Eventually, an attempt was made to conceal this discovery by simply disabling each instance of non-anomalous climate simulation software within SCP-742; these effects were disabled simply by opening them from within the simulated program environment itself. After several days of investigation, it was determined that the original binary source code had been tampered with at some point during containment; all traces of the injected source code have been completely eradicated via brute force attacks. All attempts at reversing this effect have resulted in catastrophic damage to computers involved and rendering them unusable (see experiment log 742).</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> For more information on SCP-742, see experiment log 742.</p><p><strong>Experiment Log 742:</strong></p><p>To date, only ██% of the data contained in SCP-742 can be measured, with a maximum range of ██°C. The rest of the data is still being researched at this time (see document #████).</p><p>The following testing has been approved for testing on 06/29/12 and 06/30/13:</p><p><strong>Test 1:</strong> To determine whether or not SCP-742 was being simulated using non-anomalous software packages; if so, to determine the range of data present within its simulation.</p><p><strong>Test 2:</strong> To determine how much data is contained within SCP-742's simulation; to determine the most efficient method of collecting it.</p><p><strong>Test 3:</strong> To determine the extent of SCP-742's ability to simulate Earth's climate; to determine the limits of its simulation.</p><p><strong>Test 4:</strong> To determine the effect that normal computer operations have on SCP-742; to determine the potential benefit to humanity from SCP-742's powers.</p><p><strong>Test 5:</strong> To determine whether or not SCP-742 can be used for peaceful purposes.</p><p><strong>Test 6:</strong> To determine if SCP-742's simulation is able to predict the future based on the past (e.g. predicting nuclear winter from global warming).</p><p><strong>Test 7:</strong> To determine if SCP-742 is able to predict any sort of event that hasn't yet occurred; to determine if any events have already been predicted by SCP-742."]</p>
