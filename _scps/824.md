<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-824</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-824 is kept in a standard Safe Object locker, lined with anti-corrosion material. Any personnel handling SCP-824 must be wearing at least one (1) pair of spectacles or goggle lenses. The lens of their glasses must be at least 20mm thick, and should have a lens density greater than 0.5g/cm 2.</p><p>Any personnel attempting to handle SCP-824 should be encouraged to refer to documentation provided in the file "M202".</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-824 is a 20mm circular metal plate, 2.5 cm across, in the shape of an opening muzzle. The hole through which it is intended to be used is difficult to distinguish, visually. When SCP-824 is not in use and its central button is pressed, SCP-824 will produce a .22 cm bluish flash from its muzzle. This light pulse can either be used as a sighting aid or for illumination purposes.</p><p>Instances of SCP-824 have been located and recovered outside SCP-824's initial location (Zürich, Switzerland). A second instance was accidentally produced in an American military base at ████████████ (near the US Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground) during testing of a magnetic shield system using a 40KG magnet with a diameter of 1.2m; this instance was transferred to Site 824 after [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>The following documentation on M202 has been recovered from Site 824's object locker:</p><p>Drinking from a plastic cup filled with [DATA EXPUNGED] water, provided by Dr ██████.</p><p>M202 is illuminated by [DATA EXPUNGED] flashlight beams for one minute and fifty seconds. Drinks must not be ingested during this period of illumination; the water should be bottled and offered to those who want it for consumption when M202 has been deactivated.</p><p>With the exception of the bottle containing water, all components are non-anomalous and are safe to use (the tissues in contact with the plate itself are slightly warm). Feynman rules govern whether or not there will be unwanted secondary effects as a result of using M202. The incident report regarding M-202 has been redacted.</p><p>This said, Dr ██████ was found dead several hours after being given instructions on how to use M-202 safely. Upon investigation, it was found that he had ingested [DATA EXPUNGED] water while Dr ██████'s arm had been firmly around his neck. Autopsy reports have since revealed that the subject had found this amusing, but this appears to have been mistaken for pleasure at Dr ██████'s discomfort and risk to life.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Dr ██████ had requested that no further instances of M202 be produced, and that all existing instances be returned to the Foundation. All instances have been returned.']</p>
