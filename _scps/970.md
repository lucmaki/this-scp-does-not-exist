<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-970</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-970 is currently held in a standard secure storage locker at Site-77. SCP-970 should be kept in its original packaging, and should not be subjected to temperature extremes. SCP-970 is currently stored in the Site-77 Safe Storage Locker with SCP-624.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-970 is a milk chocolate toy of an armoured knight in full plate. SCP-970 is labelled "BATTLE OF MIDDLESEX" and was manufactured in the year 1096. The packaging shows no indication of it being anomalous at all, and the product is packed with nothing other than the toy itself.</p><p>When one or more individuals consume any amount of milk chocolate containing SCP-970, they are transported to 12th Century England. One member of staff is to be present in the room at all times during testing, as it seems to be impossible to remove oneself from its effect once initiated. The individual affected will find that they have been transported to a small field outside the town of Maldon, Essex. Upon arrival, they are greeted by a group of knights and peasants in heavy armour. Combat ensues for several hours, until the object of their desire (hereafter referred to as "the recipient") has been defeated. After this, the received subject returns to their normal state with no memory of anything that happened during their absence. Subjects also report feeling as though they were physically drained of energy afterwards.</p><p>If all members of staff are unavailable when the test is carried out, then an appropriate surrogate will have to be found for the event. If an unsuitable subject is used in this capacity, then all subjects who have consumed SCP-970 will be unable to return and will remain lost in time.</p>
<p> ["Addendum 970A-1 - Recovered documentation from the year 1276 indicate that a battle in the town of Maldon occurred, but was ultimately decided in favour of Edward I by William d'Albini, a Knight Templar. At the time of his death in 1306, d'Albini left behind two sons, Thomas and Rudolf. One was raised as a Templar, while the other remained with his father's order, becoming the 3rd and 4th Grand Masters of the Order. If any more members of staff are absent at the time of testing when SCP-970 is used, then Foundation personnel present need to find ways to keep these people from leaving their area or the test will not be successful."]</p>
