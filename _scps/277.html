<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-277</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-277 has been contained in a soundproof containment chamber, measuring 25x25x30 cm (10 cubic feet). SCP-277 is to be contained in the chamber's south side, with its base facing west; however, the north and east sides of the room may be used by researchers for testing purposes.</p><p>The chamber is to be kept at a constant temperature of 22 degrees Celsius (50 deg Fahrenheit). No sunlight is to enter any portion of the chamber, as this could alter SCP-277's properties. The chamber is to be cleaned once per week by D-class personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-277 is a tiny spherical structure, measuring 1.5cm in radius and 0.8cm in height. It has no edges, but roughly resembles a triangular prism with a slightly bulging top. Its surface is smooth and mirrors the appearance of any nearby surface (including other SCPs). SCP-277's interior is completely empty, with no light source or source of temperature known to exist within it.</p><p>SCP-277 causes large amounts of heat to be generated in its vicinity. This heat will take an initial form (resembling normal body heat) that will usually dissipate within several hours. However, if SCP-277 is held by a subject for more than 3 hours, SCP-277's heat will instead form into the shape of an adult human female (designated SCP-277-1), who will attempt to communicate through speech and gestures with any person holding SCP-277. Attempts at communication are typically met with resistance; however, SCP-277-1 has been seen speaking in English, German, French and Dutch, and attempts to translate them have been successful.</p><p>SCP-277-1 displays the ability to manipulate matter from this heat through "telekinesis", which manifests as small objects such as pencils, feathers, silk flowers and other small trinkets. For every 5 minutes spent interacting with subjects holding SCP-277, an additional item can be telekinetically manipulated from within its internal temperature.</p><p>When outside of the immediate presence of subjects holding SCP-277, SCP-277-1's form does not change. When observed directly by D class personnel, the subject's form will rotate once every 2 minutes until they disappear from sight. The subject's form reverts back to normal when leaving the immediate presence of D class personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Incident 277-1</p><p>On 04/02/████, D-123524 was instructed by Dr. ████ to perform an experiment for the purpose of studying SCP-277\'s properties. D-123524 was instructed to hold SCP-277 in his left hand and maintain a constant gaze on it for 3 hours, after which he was to report back to Dr. ████.</p><p>D-123524 reported back to Dr. ████ around 10 AM, showing signs of fatigue and exhaustion. He then asked to be allowed to place SCP-277 back into its containment unit, as he had acquired some "free time". He reported that SCP-277 had taken the form of an adult male, who had attempted to speak with him through gestures, but had failed due to poor understanding of English. The subject then took the form of a small child, who attempted to play with D-123524 using a set of toys. Upon being asked by Dr. ████ why he had not attempted to report back sooner, D-123524 said that he had been "busy", before being escorted from the testing chamber. D-123524 was later re-interviewed on 04/03/████ and reported that he had "had a lot of fun" throughout the test.</p><p>D-123524 later requested transfer to a different facility, citing that he wanted "a change of pace", but this request was denied.</p>
