<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-119</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid-Crit</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A perimeter fence has been erected around the area. At night, personnel have been assigned to guard the perimeter. A section of the fence has been modified with a trapdoor to allow testing without the use of full containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-119 is a house located in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The house was sold in 1980 and has remained unoccupied since that time. No attempts to gain entry to the house have been successful. The surrounding area contains flora and fauna known to have originated from the greater Fayetteville area but have not yet been located nor are they expected to be located in the area.</p><p>All attempts to take photographs of, or otherwise document the interior of SCP-119 have resulted in anomalous phenomena completely preventing such documentation. Attempts at entering the house have had similar results. No matter what method of entry has been used, a screen on the door always prevents any attempt at completion or identification of methods.</p><p>It seems as though SCP-119 is usually inhabited by at least 1 humanoid entity that does not match any classification found to date. Efforts to find something like this, along with more general theories about what might be living inside the house's interior, have so far failed.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
