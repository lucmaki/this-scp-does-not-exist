<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-119</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid-Crit</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A perimeter fence has been erected around the area. At night, personnel have been assigned to guard the perimeter. A section of the fence has been modified with a trapdoor to allow testing without the use of full containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-119 is a house located in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The house was sold in 1980 and has remained unoccupied since that time. No attempts to gain entry to the house have been successful. The surrounding area contains flora and fauna known to have originated from the greater Fayetteville area but have not yet been located nor are they expected to be located in the area.</p><p>All attempts to take photographs of, or otherwise document the interior of SCP-119 have resulted in anomalous phenomena completely preventing such documentation. Attempts at entering the house have had similar results. No matter what method of entry has been used, a screen on the door always prevents any attempt at completion or identification of methods.</p><p>It seems as though SCP-119 is usually inhabited by at least 1 humanoid entity that does not match any classification found to date. Efforts to find something like this, along with more general theories about what might be living inside the house's interior, have so far failed.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 119-1:</strong> Upon containment, SCP-119 was found to contain a large quantity of unused government identification cards; these were crossed out and filled with a variety of different colored ink. When questioned, the person who had owned each card gave no response other than to say they were "not ready yet." The following is the list of cards present:</p>
