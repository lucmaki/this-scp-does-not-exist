<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-208</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-208 is contained in a ███m by ███m containment chamber. SCP-208 is to be contained in an environment of approximately 17°C and 60% humidity, with a minimum level of oxygen. The containment chamber's door is to remain locked at all times.</p><p>During testing, a set of tools is to be placed in the center of the containment chamber; the tools are to be changed every month or two, usually through the efforts of Level 2 personnel. SCP-208 must not be allowed to leave its containment area; if it attempts escape, it is to be properly contained and returned to its chamber. This includes objects it attempts to use as weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-208 is a two-meter tall, humanoid entity composed of an unknown material. SCP-208's DNA matches samples collected from ██████████, [REDACTED]. It is unable to speak, and has proven incapable of comprehending written English. While physical contact does not result in injury, it causes significant discomfort to the subject.</p><p>SCP-208 appears to have a great deal of strength and durability, capable of wearing heavy objects such as a fully loaded truck with ease. It uses this ability in several ways:</p><p>SCP-208 is able only to move when carrying something. It has been seen attempting to pick up moving cars with its hands and legs, but has consistently failed.</p><p>SCP-208 is also able to produce some sort of force that helps it break through surfaces (usually brick or concrete). This force can range anywhere from strong enough to tear up most substances it attempts to use, to being able to penetrate steel reinforced concrete walls and ceilings with little effort. SCP-208 claims that this "energy" is "free", and it will not cause any harm if used; however, many researchers insist that SCP-208 should be contained in a metal enclosure with nothing else inside it.</p><p>SCP-208 claims that the energy it produces will grow stronger with each use. However, no measurements or tests have been able to see this effect. Instead, researchers agree on the constant power output of 300 to 400 kilowatts; however, no measurement has been taken yet.</p><p>Several theories exist about how SCP-208 gained its superpowers.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 208-1:</strong> SCP-208 is currently being contained in a ███m x ███m containment chamber, and is to be fed one can of food per month. Partial tests have revealed that SCP-208 has grown two centimeters since it was first contained. While this is not considered to be a threat, it will be monitored closely.</p><p>After Incident 208-1, all personnel assigned to SCP-208's containment are required to wear full body armor at all times; while the containment chamber is capable of holding the weight, it is unwise to test it further.</p>
