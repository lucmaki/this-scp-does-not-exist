<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-321</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-321 is held in a Safe SCP object locker at Site 15. Testing on SCP-321 must be authorized by the site director, and researchers must be vaccinated against SCP-321 prior to testing. Requesting a C-class clearance for testing is discouraged; testing with a lower clearance level may still result in permanent damage.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-321 is an analogue to “Discovery”, the Bachelor variant. When activated, SCP-321 will, for the next seven days, issue a set of instructions to any humans testing it. The instructions must be followed exactly as written for it to work. Personnel who do not follow these instructions exactly will note that the instructions were not carried out properly, and report this to their supervisor or the site director immediately. The instructions are printed on two sheets of standard printing paper and are typed with a manual typewriter.</p><p>SCP-321 was recovered during a raid on a Satanic ritual in [REDACTED] by Foundation agents with clearance Level 3/321. Investigations prior to this date had proven fruitless, due to the fact that SCP-321 appears only in public areas.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-321 was recovered from an apartment in [REDACTED] by agents with clearance Level 2/321. Agents had been investigating a series of anomalous deaths connected to the apartment complex. The following is a transcript of an interview with one of the deceased individuals, SCP-321-1.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent ████████</p><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-321-1</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Good evening, Mr. ████████.</p><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Good evening, ma’am.</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> May I ask you a few questions?</p><p><strong>SCP-321-1:</strong> Sure.</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> What is your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-321-1:</strong> My name is John ██████████, ma’am.</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> And what is your occupation?</p><p><strong>SCP-321-1:</strong> I’m a janitor, ma’am. I clean up trash, and other stuff like that.</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> What do you think about this place?</p><p><strong>SCP-321-1:</strong> Well, it’s a little creepy, but I like it here. They pay good money for this place, and it keeps me busy. Sometimes I get bored though, you know? But then again, there are only so many places you can work at before you get old. It’s not bad though, I’ll take it for what it is.</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> Thank you for your time. Please sign here if you understand the statements you made.</p><p>SCP-321-1 signs his name on the paper.</p><p><strong>SCP-321-1:</strong> Okay, ma’am.</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> That will be all for now, Mr. ██████████.']</p>
