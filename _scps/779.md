<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-779</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-779 is to remain contained in a standard containment unit at Site-77. At all times, a security detail of two (2) armed guards are to be present and equipped with standard riot gear. SCP-779 is not to be moved from this location for any reason other than testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-779 is a large (2.1 m x 2.6 m) room located in the basement level of Site-77. It appears to be identical in every way to its surroundings. It is composed entirely of glowing blue energy resembling plasma, with an albedo of 0.7 (approximating light plasma). Within SCP-779 is a small group of three (3) humans standing facing away from the rest of the room, surrounded by a group of five (5) other humans similarly facing away from the rest of the room.</p><p>The subjects within SCP-779 vary in size and appearance, with no consistent pattern present. Jaw measurements have shown to vary between approximately 10 and 25 centimeters, while arm lengths range between approximately 15 and 40 centimeters. The skin appears to be composed primarily of conductive materials and electrical circuitry, with minor organic components present. This is seen most clearly on the backs of their hands and upper arms, which are composed almost entirely of complex wiring, switches, and mechanical parts (depending on location).</p><p>The one constant feature among the subject's appearances is that they wear identical black suits made from some unknown synthetic material (see incident report). These suits appear to be bulletproof, fireproof, and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 1800 °C for a period upwards of two (2) hours. This material also shows evidence that it has been subject to heat processing that has changed its properties significantly over time. For example, portions of this material were capable of melting at 300 °C, while others showed evidence of having undergone multiple 'hardening' processes that rendered it resistant up to 1800 °C.</p><p>Among the subjects inside SCP-779, only one has been observed wearing clothing not made from the same material: an individual wearing a white dress shirt and gray slacks (see Incident Report 679-B). All subjects seem to come equipped with several wallets containing identification cards that resemble driver's licenses or passports; these are all dated ██/██/2015 CE (Earth Standard Chronology), within the company that produces them listed as being located at [REDACTED]. All records found at this address have been classified "top secret" by US intelligence services.</p><p>SCP-779 was discovered after reports regarding increased sightings of unidentified flying objects at Area-███ in ████████ township resulted in local police units responding to reports of a possible anomalous element at large in the area; upon arriving, they found SCP-779 uncontained, but with Foundation agents already aware of its presence and containment status due to an early warning notification sent out by anonymous sources before local news media personnel could arrive on scene. The local police force then contacted local emergency responders after discovering victims found inside SCP-779 who required immediate medical attention due to exposure to potentially hazardous materials present within the structure. A clean-up operation was launched after no sign of anomalous activity was found during Foundation operatives' search through the building afterward.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Incident Report 679-B</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> SCP-779, Site-77</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/2015 CE (Earth Standard Chronology)</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1148</p><p><strong>Incident Description:</strong> D-1148 was found unconscious within SCP-779. She showed no injuries other than a few bruises on her arms and head, as well as light burns to her face. She was shown to have been in the process of wearing the same outfit worn by all subjects inside SCP-779; it was noted that she had not yet donned the suit's shirt.</p><p>Subject appeared to have been knocked out at some point while attempting to leave SCP-779, as she was found crumpled against the wall of the room with a small amount of blood coming from her nose and mouth. From her breathing and temperature measurements, it was noted that she had been unconscious for approximately three (3) minutes prior to discovery. She has not commented on what happened to her."]</p>
