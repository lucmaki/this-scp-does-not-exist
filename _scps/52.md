<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-52</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-52 is to be kept in a closed-circuit, camera-monitored room along with a designated living area. No personnel are to enter the containment chamber except for testing purposes. All persons wishing to examine SCP-52 must go through a security check.</p><p>Personnel approaching SCP-52 are not to interact with it at any time unless testing for anomalous effects. Any attempt to interact with SCP-52 by any means other than the standard procedures will result in immediate demotion and removal from this project and termination from the Foundation.</p><p>Any personnel found talking to SCP-52 during testing is to be administered amnestics and then terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-52 is a cylindrical, transparent container equipped with a single, oblong slot of 2.5Â cm in length. When the slot is aligned with an observer, it will display whatever image that observer is looking at. The instance of SCP-52 that these images are being viewed through has no apparent means of producing them, and cannot be seen directly by any person attached to the object.</p><p>Various tests have shown that these images are consistent with how the subject sees himself/herself or anyone else in his/her situation. For example, if a subject views SCP-52 while looking at SCP-48, SCP-83, SCP-84, and then SCP-77, he/she will see what would happen if he/she were to become terminally ill.</p><p>SCP-52 was recovered on 14th May 2012 after reports of "ghostly wailing" from inside the apartment building began to escalate in intensity throughout the week preceding this date. Foundation operatives were able to infiltrate the premises and apprehend SCP-52 upon which immediate quarantine procedures were initiated.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On 13th February, SCP-52 was used in the creation of SCP-84. Following the procedure, SCP-52 was sealed and placed in its containment chamber.</p><p>Following this procedure, SCP-52\'s slot displayed the following text: "What can be done? We cannot change it. But I know that you will never let him rot."</p><p>The text is written in a language similar to Sanskrit. A Foundation linguist was able to decipher some of the words and determine that they are a translation of a passage from the Hindu holy text, the Vedas.']</p>
