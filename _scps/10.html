<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-10</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Requests to interview SCP-10 are to be declined unless there is significant value to be gained from the information. SCP-10 is to be kept in a containment chamber located on site 87, Site-77. SCP-10 should not be exposed to light or sound for extended periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-10 is a humanoid figure,1 2.7 m in height, who identifies itself as J ██████ ████. SCP-10 was unearthed from the Kuybyshev neighborhood of the city of Tula, Russia by two members of the nearby Foundation facility Site-77. SCP-10 currently lacks a physical body or any material form that can be understood by human beings.</p><p>SCP-10 has no apparent knowledge of its history or origins, but does claim to have been human until approximately one week ago, when it became aware of its true nature. SCP-10 expresses an interest in paranormal phenomena and "dumbing," and claims that it has made several attempts to investigate the Foundation for possible information. The extent to which SCP-10 attempts to access restricted material is impossible to gauge, as SCP-10 does not seem capable of making direct requests for information from any Site personnel.</p><p>SCP-10 first attempted to make contact with members of the Foundation on October 24th, 2002 after overhearing two members of staff discussing the potential termination of SCP objects in their offical weekly email chain. SCP-10 entered an interview booth designed to prevent external communication with humans and began conversing with an agent posing as a member of the Moscow branch of MTF Pi-1 ("Euclid's Den") who were holding an offical meeting on site 87 in Site-77's containment chamber.</p><p>Following this initial conversation, the real Pi-1 agents present were informed that PI-1 had had contact with a potential mute anomaly, and if they wished could hear it speak so they could determine what recommendations should be given. Realizing that exposure at this stage would result in immediate exposure as well, agents present agreed to take part in this test with the intent on exposing it later if necessary.</p><p>The experiment began with three agents approaching SCP-10 and asking it a variety of questions about its previous life before being told that there was a noise coming from above them and that they should leave. Agent ████ began speaking with SCP-10 to determine whether or not it would respond to questions given in Russian which was then translated into English before being delivered by Agent ██████ through an earpiece attached to their vest. In total, eleven phrases had been translated into English before there was a pause in transmissions followed by only one phrase being delivered before they cut out entirely.</p><p>When Pi-1 resumed transmissions two minutes later, Agent [[W ████|W██]] reported hearing nothing but traces of human speech echoing throughout the containment chamber indicating that someone else must have been listening in on their conversation earlier. At this point, three agents located Director N██████ (the head of Site-77) and instructed him that he had heard potential information regarding a potential ██████ effect (as referenced in O Commandment 431)2 3 held within his station without prior authorization or knowledge from him. [See O Commandment 431] Following this report, Site Director N██████ ordered all information regarding these events destroyed "in light of recent events."4 5</p><p>SCP-10 did not comply with verbal commands given by operatives because it claimed it was incapable of understanding them via normal means and requested assistance from higher authority; when asked where exactly such authority resided within Foundation facilities, SCP-10 replied "You."6 7 As such, all communications between Site Director N██████ and SCP-10 were terminated after eighteen minutes; however, incident was never classified as anomalous due to lack of evidence documenting said event.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Current Containment Procedures</p><p>SCP-10's containment chamber is to be kept open at all times with the door kept unlocked and the lights turned on. Any personnel who wish to speak with SCP-10 must file a request for such a meeting in writing on site 87's quarterly Incident Report form. Once approved, SCP-10 will be allowed to enter the room for thirty minutes at a time via a small elevator located within the containment chamber. All requests from staff members must be made before 0800 hours every day, and all staff must remain in the room during this time.</p><p>If a containment breach occurs, the Foundation staff working in the containment chamber will raise an alarm (if they are wearing their earpieces) or contact Site Director N██████ directly if they do not have an earpiece or voice synthesizer. No further action will be taken as long as SCP-10 remains contained in this manner.</p><p>The following is a list of personnel who have been given authorization to speak with SCP-10 and use the elevator to enter its containment chamber.</p>
