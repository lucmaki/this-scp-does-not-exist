<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-630</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Access to SCP-630 is limited solely to personnel with level 3 clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-630 is a battered copy of the board game "Sorry!", which has been completely covered in fluorescent paint and stickers. The object's anomalous properties manifest when it is played by an entity without prior knowledge of its existence.</p><p>When the player rolls a die that results in a number greater than 20, they immediately win the game. The winner then becomes capable of altering the game's rules at will, and must force all players to comply with its new rules.</p><p>If the player wins more than once before anyone else rolls, they are able to become subject to the SCP's anomalous effects. All other players lose their turns and must confer with the new winner.</p><p>Attempts to gain access to SCP-630 by non-anomalous means have been unsuccessful; however, several individuals have managed to find the object through its anomalous properties, mostly as a result of winning against themselves.</p><p>The list below contains all instances of SCP-630 that have been catalogued:</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 630-1:</strong> Incident 630-01</p><p>On ██/██/20██, a group of Foundation agents was sent to retrieve SCP-630 from its temporary storage facility in [DATA EXPUNGED]. When agents ██████, ██████ and █████ discovered the object, Agent █████ became aggressive and charged towards the agents. Agent █████ tackled Agent █████ when he attempted to grab the object, allowing Agent █████ to acquire SCP-630. Agent █████ then killed both agents with a knife.</p><p>Upon being briefed on the incident, Researcher M███ reported that "It happens all the time, under any circumstances".']</p>
