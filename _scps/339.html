<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-339</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-339 is presently contained on a heavily guarded research facility. SCP-339 samples and all documentation related to the object are to be kept within this facility at all times. Any personnel wishing to study or work with SCP-339 are required to undergo an interview with Level 4 clearance or higher in order to establish an acceptable level of risk.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-339 is a large, square, stone tool approximately 1.5m in size. The object has a flat face approximately 2cm thick, with the edges being irregular and sharpened slightly. The edge of the object is coated in a black substance. Analysis has shown that this substance is composed of organic materials and fluids; in tests, it has been determined to be blood and ash from plant matter. Its origin is currently unknown.</p><p>SCP-339-1 are images and words carved into SCP-339 along its edge; from what it appears to be, SCP-339-1 is mostly concerning working plants, but also includes some crudely drawn portraits of animal specimens and figures, based on the subject's memory and understanding of their appearance at the time. Several instances of SCP-339-1 seem to indicate apparent dates of work over time, although it appears that these dates were not recorded accurately.</p><p>There have been no reports of SCP-339 affecting any living objects or humans save for those directly involved in its creation and use. However, testing has shown that all personnel who have had contact with SCP-339 will experience an intense thirst after leaving the facility that goes unquenched until they exit the building. A moderate amount of analysis has suggested that SCP-339 may affect those who did not directly handle the object in any way, although this theory has not yet been tested due to complications arising from testing with live human subjects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
