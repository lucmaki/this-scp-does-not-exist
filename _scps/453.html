<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-453</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-453 is contained in a secure cylindrical container, located 1.75 meters below the ocean floor at Site 42. SCP-453's containment unit contains four steel tanks of varying sizes. SCP-453's tanks have been fitted with automatic release mechanisms, connected to a sand pit on site 42. Each tank is filled with 500 kilograms of sand, and is emptied on a monthly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-453 is a large cylindrical anomaly, positioned in the ocean floor at a depth of 1578 meters. SCP-453 is estimated to be approximately 20 m long (including its base), with a maximum width of 12 m. This anomaly has no distinguishable composition.</p><p>SCP-453 is covered by a thick layer of nearly pure salt, forming a dome. The structure of SCP-453 resembles an armored headdress.</p><p>Computer models have shown that partial removal of the salt from SCP-453 would reveal a solid and immovable inner wall. Researchers theorize that this was most likely the case prior to SCP-453's discovery, as it displays no signs of erosion or physical destruction.</p><p>SCP-453 generates artificial gravity within 10 meters of its outer surface, centered around itself. In addition, all objects placed within 10 meters of SCP-453 will experience acceleration in order to remain suspended at the center of gravity. In cases where subjects are not wearing suitable clothing to endure the effect, they will break their necks within one week of being placed within the anomaly. For this reason, testing on humans is currently prohibited at Site 42.</p><p>When above water, it is possible to see several small light bulbs situated around SCP-453's perimeter, each producing a single photon per second. No other light sources are present; these lights are therefore assumed to be self-sustaining through a nuclear reaction taking place within SCP-453's interior, powered by four separate hydrogen cells attached on opposite sides of its interior wall.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-453 was recovered after Foundation personnel discovered anomalous light sources on the ocean floor in █████████, [REDACTED], during a routine survey. These light sources had been emitting photons for approximately one week, before being observed by Foundation personnel.</p>
