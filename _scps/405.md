<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-405</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Description and context of the means by which SCP-405 was initially contained are kept secret from the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-405 is a piece of paper with the following text on it: The following is a work of fiction.</p><p>The story, entitled "The Demon's Fate" and written in first person, describes a man named James Fenner who moves to a new town and becomes ill with a severe fever. While in his room he convinces himself that his symptoms are symptoms of an ailment which will kill him, but instead he recovers and continues his life as normal. However, after four months he is attacked by a tiger while training in the mountains and dies.</p><p>This story was originally printed in 1877, and SCP-405 was found in a copy of the magazine "Notes and Queries", dated 1929.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 405-1:</strong> On 09/13/1955, SCP-405 was discovered in a house in ██████, MA by a Foundation agent. A search of the house by the Foundation revealed the involvement of another Foundation member in the event, and suggested that a second copy of the story had been found at the same time.</p><p>This second copy was discovered in the attic of a house in ██████, MA by a Foundation researcher, and contained the following message from James Fenner:</p><p>I have observed that a tiger's claws can be deadly sharp. I am grateful to you for keeping this knowledge from me.</p><p>In 1879, unidentified persons sent a letter to James Fenner, claiming that he would be able to join God on his last journey if he wrote a story about the event. It is believed that the story was written by James Fenner after reading this letter. After the death of James Fenner, it is believed that he continued to live as normal."]</p>
