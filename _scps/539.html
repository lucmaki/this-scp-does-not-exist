<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-539</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-539 instances have been secured for study and are currently stored in storage lockers at Site-117.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-539 is a single-use ticket valid for passage on any route of the ████████ Transportation Network. SCP-539 will always conform to available seats, using seat assignment methods consistent with that of the transportation network.</p><p>In addition to its use as a ticket on the ████████ Transportation Network, SCP-539 does not appear to have any anomalous properties when used for other purposes.</p><p>The effect of SCP-539 can be blocked by applying standard anti-forgery measures such as xerography and ultraviolet copying. Tests involving non-anomalous means of altering or duplicating SCP-539 instances have not been successful.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
