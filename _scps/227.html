<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-227</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid K</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-227 is to be contained within a standard animal containment chamber located in Site-██. It is to be carried out of its chamber twice daily, and fed from a standard animal feeder. Upon completion of its feeding schedule, SCP-227 is to be returned to containment for sleep time; it should be moved for this time period as little as reasonably possible, so as to prevent any delay in the effectiveness of its sleep.</p><p>No personnel are permitted to enter or interact with SCP-227 outside of its required activities. All interaction should be carried out through recorded video, and official written documentation should take precedence over verbal communication with SCP-227.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-227 is a black domestic short-haired cat, and appears to be genetically slightly different from most attached instances of Felis silvestris, which would suggest that it may be an abnormal lifeform. The extent of its anomalous properties does not appear to have been discovered yet.</p><p>SCP-227 is not sapient; it functions as a normal animal would when left in a normally unaltered state. However, when SCP-227 is left alone in its containment chamber for 24 hours (preferably while asleep), it will undergo a change similar to the process of hibernation, becoming significantly smaller and more insubstantial. This change will persist, with the addition of a layer of subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue, until SCP-227's next feeding session; alternatively, it can be sustained indefinitely by manipulation of sleep patterns imposed on it.</p><p>This 'hibernating' state allows SCP-227 to subsist on much less energy than necessary if given sufficient time in this state; research into possible uses for this ability cannot go ahead until such research has been carried out successfully.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 227-1:</strong> Information gathered from SCP-227 during tests indicates that its anomalous properties are not limited to the hibernating state. In the state of its normal activity, SCP-227 has been shown to have a level of advanced intelligence that is comparable to that of a human toddler. SCP-227 is highly social and given to physical play when not in its hibernating state; it does not appear to be able to differentiate between play and training sessions, and therefore both are carried out with great vigour.</p><p>SCP-227 will generally only become aware of another being when it is touched, or when it is deliberately addressed. It will display an extreme reaction to this interaction; becoming distressed, agitated, and attempting to flee if necessary. Despite this, it will usually return to its normal state after a period of time. Its level of intelligence appears to be directly related to the amount of time that it spends in its hibernating state.']</p>
