<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-601</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-601 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. While it is possible to disable the unusual properties of SCP-601, only personnel with a high degree of knowledge of computers are to have direct access to it. It is to be logged into once a week, and all entries made in the past week are to be copied for use in testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-601 is a diary with roughly 525 pages. The pages are a computerized version of human handwriting, which on at least one page appears to be decorated with minor alterations such as different fonts and striking through words.</p><p>SCP-601's anomalous properties only manifest when it is (or has been) used to write entries on either computer or paper. It is possible to bookkeep SCP-601 even when the subject is not directly involved with its anomalous properties.</p><p>When an entry is made within SCP-601's scope, it will appear in its original form, complete with handwritten additions underlined and highlighted that may be viewed by anyone else except the person who wrote the entry. In addition, the entry will be written in a style that mimics that of the user, potentially making them difficult to identify or leading them to believe they penned the entry themselves.</p><p>For example, if an Unusual Use Authorization was used by Agent ███████'s desk non-production team to send an email to another member of the project team stating that they had failed a test due to sabotage, someone else would read this information after the email had been sent. However, they would have no idea who actually wrote this message on their end; it would just appear like any other "out of office" message notifying staff of Agent ███████'s absence for an unspecified amount of time for narcotics rehabilitation therapy. This can also be done with other electronic equipment such as phones and computers.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 601-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, a Foundation computer forensics team was requested to track down and document the source of SCP-601; this request was made after the discovery of a number of anomalous entries within the device. The following is an excerpt of these entries.</p><p>I'm sorry I haven't written in the past week. It's just been so hard to get time to write lately.</p><p>I love our new janitor. He's really nice and always smells like roses.</p><p>Pete, I'm so sorry I didn't tell you off when you were being a jerk. I'm really glad we're friends again though.</p>
