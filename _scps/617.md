<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-617</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-617 is stored in the Site-12 Storage Facility. No more than two staff members are to be present for testing of SCP-617. One technician has been assigned to SCP-617; any further experiments require her authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-617 is a small, red plastic table toy with a piece of paper inside. A drawing of an anthropomorphic turtle named "Chris" is printed on the paper. The only identifying marker on the paper are two lines in blue ink: "Please help me".</p><p>SCP-617's anomalous properties activate upon it being scratched on a flat surface, typically a wall or floor. If the paper inside is removed, SCP-617 will move away from the object that created the scratch. SCP-617's movements are erratic and uncontrollable; to date, no consistent path has been observed.</p><p>After establishing movement, SCP-617 will begin to travel at its greatest speed towards any marked room on the same floor level. Common places such as homes, libraries and offices have been recorded, but rooms outside of these places have also been documented. For example, SCP-617 was found in an abandoned Mall after wandering through several deserted buildings for several hours. It took several days for SCP-617 to navigate back out of the mall again by selecting its current route to "move forward", much to the dismay of those who wanted it to stop moving. SCP-617 will continue attempting to return to its starting location until it exits an indoor location at which point it reverts to an inert state.</p><p>SCP-617 can be made not to act if desired; however, this requires direct knowledge of its anomalous properties. Any personnel involved in ensuring that this happens are administered Class D amnestics and $5,000 USD in cash upon completion of testing for maintaining information about SCP-617's status.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-617 was discovered in the attic of a residential home in ██████, ████████. The Foundation was alerted to the presence of SCP-617 after receiving reports from local residents of a "strange man" who "kept coming back to the house" over several months. The Foundation was able to locate the man who had been living in the home, identified as a 40 year old male named Chris.</p><p>Interview 617-A</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Chris</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Bright</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> On the morning of █/██/██, Chris informed Dr. Bright and Agent M██████ that he had been given SCP-617 by an unknown individual.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> Good morning. We\'re here to ask you some questions about your recent acquisition of SCP-617. I\'m Dr. Bright and this is Agent M██████ and we\'re from the Foundation.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, man, I know who you are, I\'ve seen you on TV and stuff. I just don\'t understand why you want to know about this thing, man? Everyone\'s seen it before, like everywhere I go people go "Hey man, have you seen this weird thing?" It\'s like everywhere I go I see it, I\'ve seen it at work too, it\'s been everywhere…</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> Well we\'ve gotten some reports about it being seen all over town but we didn\'t really get a chance to talk to anyone about it until now. How did you get it?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Dude, I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, but yeah… I got it from this guy who wanted something else and said he\'d give me his car if I gave him a ride home. He didn\'t have any money on him, so I had to go with him. And he got out of the car and went inside this little house and came up with this weird little red thing that said "Please help me" on it and then he gave me this paper with some stuff on it and told me to give it back to whoever gave me the item when I got back to my car… So that\'s what I did.</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> So what\'s the deal? Why does this thing want you to do something? What is it?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Dude, that\'s the thing that\'s weird about it, man! It wants me to help it! It wants me to help it find its lost owner… Its owner wrote on the paper inside, asked for help finding… someone… for them to be reunited with them… But I don\'t know who they are or where they are! Like I said, it\'s everywhere! Everywhere I go! It\'s like every time someone sees it they bring it up again… They always ask me where they can get one so they can help them… But they never say who they are or where they are… And then they always take off again when they hear me asking them what their name or where they live or anything like that… So the only thing I can think of is that maybe we can help them find them? Help them reunite with their lost owner? Maybe if we try hard enough we can find out where they are?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> Okay, just tell us what you remember about the paper. Can you show us what was written on it? Maybe we can figure out where this person is in the process?</p><p><End Log>']</p>
