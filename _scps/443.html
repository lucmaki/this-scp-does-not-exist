<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-443</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Any instances of SCP-443 are to be kept in a standard metal containment locker. The locker is to be secured with two Type A locks, each fitted with a combination lock. The lock is to be opened only by two or more people simultaneously entering their respective combinations. One key should be kept written in the event that both keys are lost.</p><p>In the event that an individual with no knowledge of SCP-442 (see below) attempts to open the locker and is unable to, they are to be apprehended by security personnel and interviewed. Afterward, they will be given a class-A amnestic and released. In cases where multiple personnel are required for the retrieval of SCP-443, Foundation agents posing as pest exterminators may be used if necessary.</p><p>The locker containing SCP-443 is not to have its internal storage components removed without written permission from at least four (4) other members of level 4 or above personnel. Any attempt to remove any components from the locker without such approval will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-443 is a collection of various make-up components. SCP-443 is composed of parts from at least five different sets, separated by the presence of silicone rubber. SCP-443 is comprised mainly of lipstick and liner, although SCP-443 also contains a set of eyeshadow compacts and an eye shadow pallet.</p><p>Designated as SCP-442, these items were manufactured by Maybelline New York and have not been previously designated to any Foundation Safe class. Although they are made of standard materials and are not anomalous in their own right, they were found to be able to manifest a variety of anomalous effects when used.</p><p>SCP-442 was discovered during routine Foundation surveillance of a makeup store in Durham, North Carolina, United States. Security footage showed one male individual wearing the apparent foundation for each item catalogued in the Foundation's inventory for SCP-445 (see below), exiting the store with several sets of the compacts and pallet. Due to the time elapsed since this date and the fact that no further information has been gathered regarding him or his actions, he is known only as Individual A.</p><p>Individual A's actions are notable because they usually took place at night while he was home alone without any legitimate reason to be home alone at night. The Foundation's investigation into his habits led them to discover websites dedicated to Individual A, as well as multiple fan fiction stories about him being a member of the Foundation as SCP-444. These stories were typically written in second person format (e.g., "You're going out on a date tonight? with Individual A?").</p><p>In October of 2008, similar instances were discovered in two separate locations in Toronto, Canada; one was catalogued under the moniker "Red Lipstick" and another was listed as "Purple Cr√®me." In both cases, individual instances were discovered outside restaurants after hours where they attempted repeatedly to contact individuals who had entered them earlier but left early due to what they described as an unpleasant taste or smell.</p>
