<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-967</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-967 is to be contained in a remote area of the ███████ National Forest, where it is to be kept from the general public. No civilians are permitted to enter this area. An agent of the Foundation will monitor SCP-967's location and report any evidence of its movement or activity, including any sighting of SCP-967-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-967 is a 15 m tall structure of unknown origin, constructed from wood and metal. SCP-967 does not display any anomalous properties when observed from the outside, however when it is in use for some goal by human subjects, its interior is capable of manifesting anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-967-1 are a group of entities which manifest inside SCP-967, though they appear to be projections of the persons using them. SCP-967-1 will only manifest in the presence of the person who is currently using SCP-967. The entities can remain in an incorporeal state while inside SCP-967 and do not require air to survive.</p><p>The following is a list of known uses of SCP-967:</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 967-1:</strong> On ██/██/20██, Foundation agents discovered a small parcel of land on the border of the ███████ National Forest, which had previously been a forest. The parcel of land was found to be home to SCP-967 and an unknown entity.</p><p>When Agent ████ arrived at the structure he discovered that it was being used for recreational purposes by an unknown number of individuals. When Agent ████ attempted to enter the interior using his key, however, the door would not open. After losing track of ██ individuals inside the structure, Agent ████ retreated from SCP-967 and brought a small group of individuals with him who knew how to open SCP-967's doors. All five were successful in opening the doors, after which they entered SCP-967 where they encountered all seven entities (five members of Site-██, one member of Site-█, and two agents of MTF Baaldur).</p><p>The entities did not display any hostile intent and were allowed to depart when it was determined that they posed no danger. The parcel of land housing SCP-967 was then returned to its original state as a forested area."]</p>
