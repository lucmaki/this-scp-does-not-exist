<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-191</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutral</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-191 is to be housed within a standard SCPS-class containment unit, currently at Site-██. SCP-191 is to be fed twice daily (twin salmon from the ██████ river) and kept under constant observation; no more than 4 agents are to enter the containment chamber at any time. Agents must be equipped with containing helmets and survive/escape a mock explosion before entering the containment chamber.</p><p>Upon an agent's death while inside SCP-191's containment chamber, all personnel must withdraw via a rear hatch immediately. The agent's remains are to then be buried in unmarked graves at Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-191 is a sapient entity with a body mass of 78kg and an overall height of 1.91m (excluding the three-toed appendages), and appears to have been deceased for over 100 years.</p><p>SCP-191 is primarily made up of the dried remains of one █████████ H█████, [The nextlines are SCP-191's voiceprints]. It has been noted that many of the bones retain wound scars from where it was impaled on various objects, such as trees and rocks. There is also a large fracture in one rib which may have been caused by SCP-191's head.</p><p>When in contact with blood, SCP-191 will enter a stage of rapid growth, reaching heights exceeding its length at around three times its current size after 90 minutes or so. If given enough time its growth rate can be slowed considerably; however, it does not appear to deteriorate or age during this time.</p><p>After about 2 hours, a small amount of the blood will begin liquefying; this process continues until all blood has been absorbed into SCP-191's body mass. The amount of liquid blood necessary to induce this growth cannot be accurately measured, although countless test subjects have claimed that they felt their bodies growing as they applied more liquid blood to themselves. No significant difference in strength has occurred between any given subject and normal humans, although it may be argued that due to their limited average life span most tests are conducted on elderly individuals.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-191 has been known to possess a number of anomalous abilities, many of which have yet to be identified. Due to the potential damage such abilities could cause, SCP-191 is to remain inactive until it has been determined that said abilities have been discovered and properly contained.</p><p>SCP-191 appears to possess some form of precognition; it has been known to predict events that are over █████ years away, if not longer. It is unknown whether this ability is due to its age or if this is a natural trait.']</p>
