<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-770</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-770 is to be kept in a specially designed containment locker, located within Site 19's Safe level wing. Only one key may unlock the containment locker, and any attempt to open it without authorization will result in three (3) days of detention, with possible demotion.</p><p>When Foundation researchers wish to study SCP-770, they must have written authorization from the current head researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-770 is a large, leather-bound book, with an unknown title. The front cover is embossed with the image of a raven, made of silver and gold. The spine bears the image of a wyvern, made of silver and gold.</p><p>Any attempt to open SCP-770 without authorization results in severe pain for the individual making the attempt. This pain increases with each attempt (the higher the probability of opening SCP-770), and cannot be stopped by conventional means. Attempts to open SCP-770 if authorization has been given result in similar pain, but are perceived as pleasurable in nature, making the experience more difficult to bear. After the final attempt, individuals report feeling contentment; however, their attempts to open SCP-770 continue indefinitely.</p><p>The effects of SCP-770 can be alleviated with exposure to any form of written material that includes "The Raven King", as follows: </p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
