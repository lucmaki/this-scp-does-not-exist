<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-770</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-770 is to be kept in a specially designed containment locker, located within Site 19's Safe level wing. Only one key may unlock the containment locker, and any attempt to open it without authorization will result in three (3) days of detention, with possible demotion.</p><p>When Foundation researchers wish to study SCP-770, they must have written authorization from the current head researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-770 is a large, leather-bound book, with an unknown title. The front cover is embossed with the image of a raven, made of silver and gold. The spine bears the image of a wyvern, made of silver and gold.</p><p>Any attempt to open SCP-770 without authorization results in severe pain for the individual making the attempt. This pain increases with each attempt (the higher the probability of opening SCP-770), and cannot be stopped by conventional means. Attempts to open SCP-770 if authorization has been given result in similar pain, but are perceived as pleasurable in nature, making the experience more difficult to bear. After the final attempt, individuals report feeling contentment; however, their attempts to open SCP-770 continue indefinitely.</p><p>The effects of SCP-770 can be alleviated with exposure to any form of written material that includes "The Raven King", as follows: </p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-770 was recovered from the home of Abner Fitch, located at ██████, ██████. Fitch was found dead in his home of a heart attack, and an autopsy revealed that he had been writing "The Raven King" on his body, with several puncture wounds.</p><p>Appendices for The Raven King:</p><p>A series of novels by Abner Fitch, all titled The Raven King</p><p>The Raven King by Abner Fitch</p><p>The Raven King is the only book in Abner Fitch\'s collection that does not use the title "The Raven King." It was written in the late 1800s, but has not been translated into English. The following Foundation translation was done by Dr. ████████.</p><p>And to this day I can\'t understand why it is so hard to find a way down from the tower. If you think about it, there\'s no reason why we have to climb all the way up to the top. I mean, if we could just find a way down from the ground, then we could find a way down from anywhere else in the kingdom. And that would be just as easy as finding a way up. All we have to do is reach out and grab hold of something solid and pull ourselves back down to the ground. But why is it so hard to do that? Why can\'t we just let go of this impossible tower and fall down into our kingdom?</p><p>I know I\'m not the only one who feels like this. It\'s like our kingdom is one big tower, and you can only get to the top if you make it all the way up there. And once you\'re at the top, there isn\'t any reason why you can\'t stay there forever. So why don\'t we just find a way down?</p><p>I guess it\'s really hard to do that because we\'re afraid of falling.']</p>
