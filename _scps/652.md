<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-652</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-652 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber on Site-██. SCP-652 is to be fed sugar syrup and water daily, and a single honeybee is to be released into the chamber once every three (3) weeks.</p><p>As of ██/██/19██, bees are to be released into SCP-652 at the following intervals:</p><p>Once per week for SCP-652-2 and SCP-652-4.</p><p>Once per month for SCP-652-3.</p><p>Once every three (3) years for SCP-652-5.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-652 is a cardboard box measuring 12cm by 12cm by 6.5cm, in which five honeybees (Apis mellifera) have been stored for about one year, starved for forty days, and then killed by freezing. All five were released into the box on ██/██/19██, with the intention of establishing a hive. It has been shown that although the bees are alive, they lack cognitive functions and live solely to fulfill the role of pollination; when food is provided, they will survive indefinitely.</p><p>When SCP-652 is opened, regardless of what time of day or night it is, a single hornet (Vespa mandarinia) will emerge from the box and fly away. If a human presents themselves within ten (10) meters of SCP-652 after it has been opened, an additional hornet will emerge from the box and attempt to sting them on the wrist. The hornet will then proceed to attempt to enter the skin of the subject by piercing it with its stinger; once this succeeds, it will burrow its way into the chest cavity and begin feeding on the blood vessels therein.</p><p>The hornets are initially docile during this process; however, if they are exposed to any form of radiation (such as sunlight), they will aggressively charge towards it, attempting to avoid being hit by it at all costs. It is possible for them to die due to loss of contact with sunlight, but if their stinger makes contact with said radiation, they will resume feeding momentarily before dying out of overexposure.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of the conversation between Dr. ███████ and SCP-652-1:</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Good morning, SCP-652-1.</p><p><strong>SCP-652-1:</strong> Good morning.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> How are you today?</p><p><strong>SCP-652-1:</strong> Fine.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> You don\'t sound fine; I\'m afraid for your health.</p><p><strong>SCP-652-1:</strong> I\'ll be ok, I promise.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> How can you promise that?</p><p><strong>SCP-652-1:</strong> I would if I could, but it\'s not my choice to make.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>SCP-652-1:</strong> I\'m not allowed to go outside anymore. So, I can\'t be happy because I know that eventually I\'ll have to get back into those horrible bees\' nests and suffer the wrath of the queen again. Every time I get out here, she gets mad at me and makes me go back in to feed them more honey than normal. So I can\'t be happy or satisfied with my life because every time I try to escape, something bad happens and keeps me from doing so again.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> That\'s… rather sad, isn\'t it?</p><p><strong>SCP-652-1:</strong> Yes, it is. But that\'s what happens when you\'re put into a situation you didn\'t want to be in. So any advice on how to get out of this situation?</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Well, if you really want to get out, you could try to talk to your hive queen once she comes back for the night and try… persuading her to let you out again next time she goes out on her own.</p><p><strong>SCP-652-1:</strong> Will that work?</p><p>Dr. ███████ chuckles slightly at this point before replying "Yes, it should work."</p><p><strong>SCP-652-1:</strong> Okay then – thank you for your help!</p><p><End Log>']</p>
