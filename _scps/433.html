<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-433</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-433 is currently contained at Site-██, along with SCP-800 and SCP-718. SCP-433 is to be kept in an airtight container in a 25 m x 25 m containment cell, made of concrete and lined with titanium sheets. It is to receive a constant supply of fresh water, one personnel trained in the handling of high voltage discharges is to be on standby at all times.</p><p>One personnel may enter the containment cell at any time for up to 1 hour at a time, and may receive only two 30 minute breaks per week. All personnel who enter the containment cell are required to wear full body protection (e.g. hazmat suits) and live-wire detection equipment is to be installed around the perimeter of the cell. No outside personnel are allowed near the containment cell. Any personnel assigned inside the containment cell are required to wear full body protection and live wire detection equipment at all times, and must remain within the range of the room's ceiling mounted surveillance camera at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-433 is a large square block of solid steel, measuring approximately 2.7m x 2.7m x 2.7m, with 16 glass windows evenly spaced around its circumference. The doors and windows are all securely locked from the inside.</p><p>When a person steps on the bottom step of the entrance to the containment cell and closes their eyes for one minute, the person will become very drowsy and begin to experience hallucinations of his/her surroundings being flooded with a low amperage electrical current. The current may be interrupted by rubbing or touching parts of the body that are not touching the bottom step of the doorway. After a period of time ranging from 10 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the individual's capabilities and situation, the current will suddenly stop (but the effects will continue) and the individual will open their eyes to see themselves in their surroundings in their full costume as SCP-800-2; i.e. SCP-433 is telekinetic but its ability to interact with people comes in the form of electricity.</p><p>After this effect wears off, an even lower power amount of electricity may be felt for up to one minute at which point it stops again (but continues indefinitely). If an individual manages to stay on the bottom step of the doorway for more than two hours, they will begin to exhibit electric hallucinations similar to those experienced by individuals exposed to SCP-433 after five hours or longer; they will see small pieces of copper wire anchored throughout their bodies wrapping around each other, forming a nest which is just under 0.5 cm long and 0.5 cm wide at most, emulating nerve tissue and arteries, as well as wiring that connects them together before moving around them at different speeds up to 300 m/s; once again this process only stops if the individual remains on one spot for more than two hours; ultimately these wires are not physically connected with anything else but merely act as though they were attached through connecting points with what appears outwards to be veins (these wires do not show signs of wear), however these wires can be damaged and severed through normal means such as cutting them with knives or shooting them with bullets; also similar to SCP-433 above, when an individual is touched by SCP-433's wires in this state they feel an excruciating pain at random intervals throughout their entire body; when prepared properly however this extreme pain can be used as a means of transferring information through SCP-433's "wiring" into another person's brain; therefore personnel who find themselves subjected to SCP-433's effects must remove any clothing covering their skin before entering its zone or else they risk permanent injury if properly treated after leaving it.</p><p>When fully grown, these wires will converge at a single point located on each subject's head in an area between both ears; however due to its advanced age nothing can be done to prevent this occurrence since SCP-433 was first contained over 200 years ago.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-433 was originally contained in a small town in western Germany which was flooded by flooding when some nearby dams suddenly broke. All inhabitants of the town, who were all local farmers, were killed instantly. SCP-433\'s current location was found by a Foundation team in 1984 after an informant reported that "The wall of Obergrundenburg is falling" and a Foundation team was sent to investigate. SCP-433 was not directly affected by the flood but researchers believe it was made aware of its surroundings through SCP-800-4. Since then it has been contained away from large populations of people, due to the dangers it poses to them.</p>
