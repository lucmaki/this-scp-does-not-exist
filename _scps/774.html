<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-774</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All Foundation assets in San Francisco are to monitor the movement of SCP-774. Surveillance teams are to monitor any civilian activity closely, and report any unauthorized movement of SCP-774. The Foundation is to sponsor a media campaign that claims that no large object has sunk into Yerba Buena Cemetery since 1817, and that it should be considered a paranormal phenomenon. A team of Foundation Agents will travel to Yerba Buena Court House to petition for a 'hostile takeover' of the area by Foundation assets. Any civilians remotely affiliated with SCP-774 are to be detained and administered Class-B amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-774 is a large, anomalous object that is believed to have breached San Francisco Bay sometime in the late 19th century. SCP-774 is made of various exotic and unknown materials. SCP-774 is estimated to be approximately 907m long, 10m high, and possesses enough mass to submerge Yerba Buena Cemetery completely.</p><p>When submerged, all prominent landmarks will "disappear" from outside observation. In reality, these locations were all under water at some point. This mystery has been solved by Foundation personnel who repeatedly attempted to locate major cities known for their ghost sightings with similar results.</p><p>SCP-774's anomalous properties become dissociated from the environment it is submerged in, allowing it to be located regardless of water depth. However, if the Submerged Location is occupied by human entities or human structures, SCP-774 will only become visible when it is fully submerged beneath the surface of the water.</p><p>SCP-774's structural integrity can be completely maintained while submerged on a theoretical basis by using a combination of materials similar to those used in the construction of submarines. Unfortunately, no known means of matter transportation could allow Foundation assets to carry out this procedure without making SCP-774 visible due to its size. For this reason, it has been deemed impractical as a containment option, and no further research on SCP-774's anomalous properties are currently being performed.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-774 is believed to have breached the Bay sometime in the late 19th century. The most plausible theory is that SCP-774 was constructed by the Foundation in an attempt to prevent the impending extinction of humanity.</p>
