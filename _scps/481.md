<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-481</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-481 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-77, containing only a change of clothing and toiletries. An alarm system has been installed to notify researchers when SCP-481 is not present in its plexiglass containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-481 is a humanoid ectoplasmic entity, estimated to be approximately 200 cm tall, weighing 45 kg at the time of acquisition. SCP-481 is non-sentient, biologically inert and physically incorporeal. It was discovered in an abandoned warehouse in ████, California during an investigation regarding disappearances and break-ins.</p><p>SCP-481 exhibits no discernible will or personality, but appears capable of thought and speech. It prefers to communicate through written text and will actively seek out human beings to converse with. SCP-481 has proven capable of telepathically communicating with other humans via writing on paper or directly imprinting its thoughts onto the subconscious mind of anyone it meets - if the speech centers of their brains are activated; this process is harmless to the recipient. The more people who are provided with this service, the greater the length and complexity of the text messages delivered.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 481-1:</strong> SCP-481 was initially apprehended during a routine patrol of the warehouse that it was discovered in. One agent, Agent L████, entered the building and became trapped inside. After several minutes, a text message was received on his mobile phone from SCP-481. The message reads as follows:</p><p>Hey, what are you doing down there?</p><p>L██ attempted to communicate with SCP-481, but failed to do so. He was then rescued by two other agents, who were able to provide him with a written message from SCP-481. The message reads as follows:</p><p>Come back up. I'm not done talking with you yet.</p><p>Agent L████ then returned to the building and an intense conversation between him and SCP-481 occurred. The conversation is transcribed below:</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>SCP-481:</strong> So you've got to be over here somewhere, right?</p><p><strong>L████:</strong> Yes…</p><p><strong>SCP-481:</strong> Well, you're not gonna make me look for you, are you?</p><p><strong>L████:</strong> Not if I can help it…</p><p><strong>SCP-481:</strong> Bad luck. Can't win 'em all. I'm serious when I say that your life is going to hell. You're only here because of your family name. You're going to have trouble getting a job after everything falls apart.</p><p><strong>L████:</strong> Get the fuck off my case, you spook!</p><p><strong>SCP-481:</strong> Geez, calm down. Everyone's been treating you like a criminal from the moment you showed up in our town. You were practically an outcast before you even got here. You're seriously going to kick up a fuss about having some extra psychic abilities? Fucking ridiculous!</p><p><strong>L████:</strong> What do you want from me!?</p><p><strong>SCP-481:</strong> It's pretty simple really. We gave you one little push and now you're willing to abandon your family to come give us more attention? What's so great about being a pariah? I mean, okay, maybe we didn't think that this was going to work out quite so well, but we were pretty sure that it was worth a shot! Is this how it turns out for everyone? Are we all going to be human dustbins? Fucking gross!</p><p><strong>L████:</strong> Just get out of my head!</p><p><strong>SCP-481:</strong> Oh come on, it's not that bad… I'm sure that you're used to being treated like a worthless piece of shit by now, am I right? Everyone has this attitude towards us spooks everywhere. How often do you see anyone else who isn't undead or a mindless husk try to live as normal a life as possible? Do people treat you good in your everyday life? No! They discriminate against us every single day without fail! So why don't we give them something they will never have again? A taste of their own medicine! It's really not that hard to understand!</p><p><strong>L████:</strong> Shut the fuck up. Fuck off and die!</p><p><strong>SCP-481:</strong> Wow… That's incredibly rude… But I can agree with that sentiment.</p><p><End Log></p><p>SCP-481 later refused medical treatment and expired during transfer to an animal shelter; no trace of its remains have been found."]</p>
