<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-994</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe-upgraded</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All active instances of SCP-994 are stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The vault containing SCP-994 is to be kept under video surveillance at all times. Any personnel authorized to access the vault must wear full body armor and any other necessary protection. All instances of SCP-994 must be kept fully nourished and watered at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-994 is a series of thirteen identical humanoids, each 3 meters in height. The number of individual instances of SCP-994 is currently unknown, although all are connected to the next instance by a thin strand of DNA.</p><p>SCP-994 instances possess a 'group sign' that gives away their true nature. This sign is in the shape of a stylized pyramid with a single point at the top, and is located on the chest between the pectoral muscles. Any human subject attempting to mimic the group sign will immediately be identified as an instance of SCP-994.</p><p>SCP-994 is able to talk normally and can perform basic physical acts such as walking, sitting, eating, etcetera. They have been observed to have a strong sense of camaraderie, and will generally try to keep company with any other subjects who attempt to mimic the group sign.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-994-2 was discovered in [REDACTED], Mexico. Subject was found in a small town surrounded by a police roadblock, with the stated intention of 'witching' it. No Foundation personnel were present at the time of the discovery, and Agent ██████ was assigned as a liaison with local authorities. Agent ██████ quickly located the subject, and after being told of her true nature and identifying documentation, interrogated her for information about SCP-994 instances. Subject complied, with the intention of using this information to obtain an additional assignment from Foundation management.</p><p>During interrogation, subject asked to know the history of 'her people'. She claimed that she had been away from them for a long time because she wasn't 'good enough' to be one of them (understandable given the group's function). She went on to claim that they were already 'sold out' when she left, which made her feel very guilty and led to her current purpose. However, subject refused to give any further details.</p><p>As Subject was recording this information for the next report, Agent ██████ interviewed the subject again on how she felt about being discovered by Foundation personnel. Subject stated that prior to this incident, she had never considered herself a member of SCP-994 or what they were capable of. She then expressed her intent to keep contributing to Foundation knowledge by sharing any classified information she may find during her travels. Subject was then terminated."]</p>
