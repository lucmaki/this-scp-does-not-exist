<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-288</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-288 is to be maintained at the Site-10 Low-Risk Containment Zone. As of the noted date, SCP-288's perimeter fence has been upgraded with the latest security technologies, and is to be patrolled via unmanned anti-personnel drones.</p><p>As per the Foundation Memorandum on Less than Lethal Weapons and Biological Agents, SCP-288 is to remain in a shielded containment cell while being tested by any unaffiliated research teams. Any staff members testing SCP-288 must wear protective gear and must not be within 5 meters of SCP-288 when it is activated.</p><p>No more than two staff members are permitted at one time when testing SCP-288; any staff member who is within 50 meters of SCP-288 when it is activated will be permanently removed from duty. Any experimentation with SCP-288 that takes place outside of Foundation oversight must be coordinated in advance with the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-288 is a two meter by three meter blue steel flagpole. The decorative metalwork of the flagpole has been painted over in black and white, with a message in an unknown language across the center of the pole. There is no way to discern the name of SCP-288's creator; however, it is assumed to be Juutia, based on his/her consistent use of the phrase "Juutia without hesitance" during interviews.</p><p>If a human subject touches SCP-288 and makes contact with their head within 0.7 meters of its tip, that subject will be immediately transported to Juutia's throne room.</p><p>The complex appears to have been abandoned for decades - various features have been stripped or otherwise damaged by time, including cracks along the ceiling and walls, loose plaster tiles on the floor, and cobwebs throughout. SCP-288's arrival will not cause any additional damage to this area; however, it is recommended that any testing and/or experimentation be done in areas where SCP-288 cannot leave behind any obvious lingering artifacts. Any interior objects transported using SCP-288 are identical in appearance to any other known object that would be located in Juutia’s kingdom (i.e. [DATA EXPUNGED]).</p><p>Upon arrival, the subject will find themselves in a small central room with a litter box and several pieces of fruit near them. The room also contains several chairs: two facing each other with arms outstretched, as well as a throne with a chair positioned beneath it, facing away from the subject(s). A large red curtain marks the entrance to another room, which appears to be controlled by a mechanism similar to an automatic door.</p><p>SCP-288's effects can only be triggered once per day; if both subjects remain inside for longer than one hour in total, the effect wears off and both subjects return to their original location. Testing has shown no instance where more than one subject was present inside at once; however, even with one additional person present within 50 meters of SCP-288 at any given time, any additional subjects who enter past 50 meters from SCP-288 will only trigger its effects if they touch their head upon entry into the complex (in accordance with all other testing rules).</p><p>Once per day after activating SCP-288 for the first time (process outlined below), Juutia will oversee two sessions:</p><p>Any discussion between these two men will be limited to issues related to law and order within Juutia’s kingdom - practice runs tend to take place under relatively peaceful conditions (one case saw an uncooperative subject being accused of witchcraft while another aimed insults at him), but there have been no incidents during actual trials.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-288 was recovered from the estate of an elderly gentleman by Foundation agents after receiving a tip from a nine-year-old boy. The man had been reported missing and his house abandoned for several months prior to its discovery. While the man's body was discovered in the front room, there were no other clues to suggest that he may have been involved in any criminal activity - aside from a large amount of cash hidden under the floorboards, there was nothing else of interest or value in the house.</p><p>The man's name was confirmed as Juutia; however, all records of him are incomplete and do not contain any information beyond his birth date. The only information available on him is contained in the following document, which appears to be a journal entry.</p><p>I don't know where she went.</p><p>She was so beautiful, with her hair flowing down her back and her eyes shining like the sun. She looked at me with those big eyes, and told me that everything will be alright, that she would make sure that I wouldn't suffer anymore.</p><p>I tried to resist, but she had such a sweet voice. So soft, so gentle. She brought me so much joy when she sang, and when I looked into her eyes I felt like I could do anything.</p><p>She said that if I listened to her and did what she said, then everything would be alright.</p><p>So I did what she asked me to.</p><p>I didn't care if she was going to kill me anymore. I wanted her to stop hurting me.</p><p>Still, even though it was hard at first, we made it work and soon enough the nightmares stopped coming. I even thought about moving away from home to start a new life with her by my side - but then she just left.</p><p>Where'd she go? Why'd she leave? What did she want from me?</p><p>It's been years since then and I still don't know what happened to her - but I'm tired of living in fear of the dreams.</p><p>I've been working on this journal for long enough - I'm ready to start my new life now.</p>
