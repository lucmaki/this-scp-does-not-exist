<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-804</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-804 is kept in a secure room at Site-██. SCP-804's containment chamber is outfitted with two CCTV cameras, two microphones, and two speakers. The SCP and its environmental chamber are to be monitored continuously by a security camera and digital audio recording equipment. One speaker and microphone are located on the side of SCP-804. A second speaker is located inside the door of the SCP's containment chamber. During testing, this setup allows personnel to listen to the internal sounds of SCP-804 without interfering with its containment. Additionally, personnel are instructed to stay 2 meters away from the object during testing.</p><p>Audio recordings of SCP-804 will be played over loudspeakers in a testing chamber and recorded by video equipment whenever possible.</p><p>Any physical damage inflicted upon SCP-804 must be immediately repaired using appropriate materials; any permanent damage to the object must be addressed by repair before further testing may proceed. Failure to do so will result in immediate suspension of research on this object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-804 is a 3m long, 35cm wide and 25cm tall object composed of stainless steel with the appearance of a metallic filet-o-fish. SCP-804 will respond to any action within its field of view by emitting an audible sound, usually that of a sharp slap on metal. This range appears to extend at least 10 m behind the object and around 15 m above the object, but the exact limits are unknown. As with all objects given a non-penetrating subject, the sound emitted by SCP-804 does not travel beyond the object itself (i.e. outside its field of vision).</p><p>During testing, SCP-804's effect is limited to language; there is no discernible pattern to what it produces other than its speech syntax, grammar or vocabulary are similar to that of humans and contain no brand or proprietary name or mention of any individual or organization. In addition, no known language has been recorded by SCP-804 either before or after testing has been completed.</p><p>SCP-804 was found in the ████████ restaurant in ████████, ██████ on 12/20/1997. The owner of the restaurant had written "I have something very valuable inside my filet-o-fish" on a napkin and left it on the countertop when she went home for the evening. Foundation agents investigating reports of a possibly unidentified source brought SCP-804 to Site-██ where it was examined and contained shortly after capture.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of a conversation between Agent ████████ and SCP-804. The conversation took place on 12/20/1997 at 11:07AM EST.</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> Hello, SCP-804?</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> Who is this?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> My name is Agent ████████, and I\'d like to speak with you.</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> What is your business?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> I\'m investigating reports of a possible unidentified source that has been causing damage in the area.</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> Damage? What kind of damage?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> I\'m not sure…but there have been reports of some kind of sound coming from inside the filet-o-fish. It sounds like a sharp slap on metal, but the range appears to extend at least 10\xa0m behind the object and around 15\xa0m above it.</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> Is this a joke? How could you possibly investigate something like that? Do you know who I am? I own this place!</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> I\'m sorry, I don\'t understand. Who are you?</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> I\'m the owner of this establishment, and you\'re speaking to me about my property! Now get out!</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> Listen, I—</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> I said, get out!</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> I—</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> Get out!</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> —can\'t hear you, SCP.</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> Listen here, kid, this isn\'t funny! Some moron comes in here and asks me about my filet-o-fish and tries to talk about some supposed damage. If you don\'t get out here right now, I\'m gonna have security throw you out!</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> Look…I don\'t know what\'s going on here, but if there\'s something wrong with your object…</p><p><strong>SCP-804:</strong> Just get out of my store! I\'ll call the police!</p><p><strong>Agent ████████:</strong> Wait, wait…I just want to ask a few questions! Please—</p><p>SCP-804 begins to bang on its containment chamber door while yelling "Get out!" repeatedly; contact with personnel is lost shortly thereafter. A search of the area by Foundation agents revealed no signs of any disturbance within a 2\xa0km radius of Site-██; additionally, no records exist of any local police department. On 12/20/1997 at 19:17PM EST, SCP-804 ceased all activity for approximately 45 seconds before resuming normal operation.']</p>
