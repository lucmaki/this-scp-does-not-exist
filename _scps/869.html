<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-869</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All impressions of SCP-869-1 are to be monitored and any anomalous behavior recorded. For example, the locations of documentations regarding SCP-869-1 are to be monitored for deviations from expected locations. Any irregularities in this regard are to be reported to Dr. Nooneti as soon as possible.</p><p>SCP-869-2 is currently contained at Site███. It is to be maintained under standard humanoid containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-869-1 is a large number of spherical impressions which measure 1.2 meters in diameter, located throughout the universe and are heavily concentrated within civilizations. These impressions can be found in locations as diverse as planets, asteroids, and moons. They are distinguished by smooth surfaces with no known physical reason for their existence.</p><p>Conversely, SCP-869-2 is a series of coordinates which lead to the location of an image of SCP-869-1. This image is usually found on paper, parchment or papyrus which is either folded or wrapped around itself in the most primitive way possible. These images have the effect of stimulating anomalous neural activity inside the viewer, similarly to how psychedelic drugs affect human brains. The experience produced by SCP-869-2 varies from user to user but typically results in severe hallucinations.</p><p>In addition to SCP-869-2 and its effects, SCP-869 objects have been found on various planets/star systems throughout the universe, at various points in time. These ‘lucky charms’ appear to serve a religious purpose for many groups and can be used as proof that these groups exist and that they exist before other groups (or even the Foundation itself).</p><p>SCP-869 was recovered after an Intergalactic Foundation task force discovered several [DATA EXPUNGED]. The identity of this entity is currently unknown. Despite several attempts made by the Psi Division to uncover more information about SCP-869 it has been unsuccessful due to the fact that all direct interrogations were covered with disinformation campaigns by the group responsible for its classification: The Galactic Religious Entity (GREE) or "The Entity". To date, such attempts have failed.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 869-A:</strong> Timeline of SCP-869-2</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 7/4/1816</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> The Middle East</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> This parchment contains a series of instructions for a pilgrimage to Mecca, which is to be initiated by the year 2076. The instructions contain diagrams of objects which are to be used during the pilgrimage and lists of resources needed for the journey. The last page is blank, with no indication of where the document had been found. The parchment has been dated to have been written in the middle ages.</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/23/1896</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Antarctica</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> This paper contains an image depicting a human figure standing on a rock amidst the ice. Behind this figure are several animals that resemble dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. On the ground are a number of footprints which appear to belong to these animals. On top of the image is written in Latin: "Beware. The water." A translation of this text has been refused by O Command.</p>
