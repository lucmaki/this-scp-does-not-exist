<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-761</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area encompassing SCP-761 is to be surrounded by an 8 km no trespassing zone consisting of an electric fence, concrete barriers and 3,000 kg of salt per meter of the surrounding terrain. Two security teams are to patrol SCP-761's perimeter at all times.</p><p>Any persons who have entered SCP-761's area of effect are to be listed as missing and searched for in a 5 kilometer radius around SCP-761. Any persons reported to be entering SCP-761's area of effect are to be immediately pepper sprayed and detained until Site-19 is able to contain the anomaly. Any Foundation personnel entering SCP-761 are to wear full protective gear upon entering.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-761 is a large, undulating geyser that has been active since 1978. SCP-761 has a maximum range of 3.2 kilometers, and the top of SCP-761's spigot is approximately 25 m above sea level. The spigot has been consistently spewing water at a rate of 12 liters per second.</p><p>SCP-761's water properties have nowhere near reached chemical equilibrium, allowing it to retain a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius despite its location in the sea. This hot water causes severe burns to any individuals that come into contact with it for prolonged periods of time. Any clothing or skin burnt by SCP-761 is considered lost and will be unceremoniously incinerated if it is found within an area of effect before treatment from Site-19 personnel.</p><p>To date, no one has ever survived coming into contact with SCP-761 for more than three minutes without being severely burned. The most common cause of death among individuals caught up in SCP-761's range is asphyxiation due to the hot water caused by SCP-761's constant eruption; however, many others die from immediate severe burns as well.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
