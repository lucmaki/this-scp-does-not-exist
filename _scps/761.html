<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-761</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area encompassing SCP-761 is to be surrounded by an 8 km no trespassing zone consisting of an electric fence, concrete barriers and 3,000 kg of salt per meter of the surrounding terrain. Two security teams are to patrol SCP-761's perimeter at all times.</p><p>Any persons who have entered SCP-761's area of effect are to be listed as missing and searched for in a 5 kilometer radius around SCP-761. Any persons reported to be entering SCP-761's area of effect are to be immediately pepper sprayed and detained until Site-19 is able to contain the anomaly. Any Foundation personnel entering SCP-761 are to wear full protective gear upon entering.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-761 is a large, undulating geyser that has been active since 1978. SCP-761 has a maximum range of 3.2 kilometers, and the top of SCP-761's spigot is approximately 25 m above sea level. The spigot has been consistently spewing water at a rate of 12 liters per second.</p><p>SCP-761's water properties have nowhere near reached chemical equilibrium, allowing it to retain a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius despite its location in the sea. This hot water causes severe burns to any individuals that come into contact with it for prolonged periods of time. Any clothing or skin burnt by SCP-761 is considered lost and will be unceremoniously incinerated if it is found within an area of effect before treatment from Site-19 personnel.</p><p>To date, no one has ever survived coming into contact with SCP-761 for more than three minutes without being severely burned. The most common cause of death among individuals caught up in SCP-761's range is asphyxiation due to the hot water caused by SCP-761's constant eruption; however, many others die from immediate severe burns as well.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/1981, a large rock formation resembling a human figure was discovered on the top of SCP-761\'s spout. The area around the formation was cordoned off and the Foundation began an investigation. After several months of investigation, it was discovered that the figure was caused by the erosion of SCP-761\'s spigot over time, creating a "mouth" for SCP-761 to spew water out of.</p><p>On ██/██/1982, a similar figure was found above the mouth of SCP-761. This figure had been carved by some unknown entity and also featured a geyser in its "mouth". This wrung the Foundation\'s neck and they wanted to know who was responsible for these figures.</p><p>The following is an excerpt from a report on SCP-761 dated ██/██/1982:</p><p>"I\'ve been doing some investigating on this SCP and what I\'ve found is rather confusing. I\'ve found figures carved in the shape of mouths on both the spigot and mouth of SCP-761. As far as we can tell, they\'re made by the erosion of SCP-761\'s spigot and not just natural erosion. The thing is, there\'s no way that it could naturally erode into such perfectly shaped forms. For example, I took a photo of one of them (see attachment) and compared it to one of nature\'s own creations and they are identical! They are perfect in every regard."</p><p>- Dr. ███████</p>
