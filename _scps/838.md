<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-838</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Two teams of security personnel are to be maintained at both the front and back gates of Site-53. If SCP-838 should leave its enclosure, the appropriate teams are to chase it down, and prevent it from reaching a populated area.</p><p>SCP-838's enclosure is to remain heavily surveilled at all times, with cameras and other sensors constantly monitoring it for signs of movement or entrance. Toward this end, two pairs of trained crows are to be kept in a coop near the enclosure. Any attempts by SCP-838 to enter the enclosure are to be thwarted, as quickly as possible, by plucking SCP-838's wings off with tweezers, then inserting these tweezers into its left eye socket. Once this procedure has been completed successfully on eight consecutive days, SCP-838 is permanently contained in a crate within its enclosure. Personnel must ensure that SCP-838's crate remains in the same position within its enclosure, so that the light shines directly into the crate through a small slit cut into the top of the crate.</p><p>Should SCP-838 break containment or escape site security, Site-23 will be engaged to neutralize it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-838 is a large blue-green crow, approximately [DATA EXPUNGED], resembling the extinct dodo bird (Raphus cucullatus) of the seventeenth century. SCP-838 resembles a living dodo in all other regards, and appears to have no anomalous properties aside from its feathers growing in solid form at their point of origin. As a result, it can be easily captured by hand.</p><p>SCP-838 is highly intelligent, capable of manipulating several different tools to achieve its goals and display dominance over other crows. It will flee into a densely populated area when it feels threatened, but will attempt to return if it bridges the gap between itself and the threat. It will also attempt to use people to reach a desired location. In these circumstances, SCP-838's intelligence is shown through interaction with humans: whenever a human voice calls out an action to SCP-838 during this time, it will take the action at question. If sufficient people call out an action at once similar to what SCP-838 has asked for, SCP-838 will attempt to blend in with the crowd until its desired action has been completed. This behavior indicates that it possesses full sentience and sapience, although communication between SCP-838 and humans may be disorganized or difficult due to its lack of language.</p><p>SCP-838 seems to derive pleasure from observing humans in conflict or argumentation, and will alter its actions in order to cause this effect: it has been observed attempting to distract or actively interfere with verbal disputes between two men, as well as attempting to make another crow angry enough to attack the first crow en route to attacking two humans. When two groups of humans are focused on shouting at each other (henceforth referred to as 'The Fight'), SCP-838 will take this opportunity if present and fly up high into a tree where it may observe The Fight unfold unimpeded. Either way, should a fight occur during daylight hours SCP-838 will intervene in some manner.</p><p>This documentation is based on interviews conducted with SCP-838 by Drs ████████ and █████████ between 01/04/1994 - 02/26/1994.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 838-1:</strong> SCP-838 was first discovered in the ████████ National Forest, in ██████, California on 02/26/1994. Upon being captured by Foundation personnel, SCP-838 expressed confusion as to why it was being kept in a cage, and asked if it could be set free. Dr. █████████ had been observing SCP-838 for several days, and suggested that it was not safe to return it to the wild. Instead, it was taken to Site-23 and placed in its current containment chamber.']</p>
