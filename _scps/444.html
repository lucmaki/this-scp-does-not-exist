<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-444</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All Foundation agents embedded in the worldwide media can communicate about SCP-443, but must refer to it as "new year's countdown". This is to ensure that no agents are captured by MTF Nu-7 ("Infrasound") if they reveal the true nature of SCP-443.</p><p>Foundation agents embedded in governments around the world must publicly deny knowledge of "new year's countdown" and any other aspects of isolated anomalous phenomena, in order to prevent capture by MTF Nu-7.</p><p>Personnel are forbidden from mentioning SCP-443 under any circumstances. Failure to do so will result in a Class-A amnestic being administered.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-443 is a widespread annual phenomena that remains unseen by the general public. SCP-443 is invisible to the naked eye and cannot be detected through chemical means.</p><p>SCP-443 only comes into existence in nations that are not currently ruled by a government that has been infiltrated by Foundation agents.</p><p>Invisible to the naked eye, SCP-443 manifests every year shortly before midnight on the first day of January, then disburses in local time zones as described below.</p><p>First, an obelisk will appear within a radius of 1000km from its location (in New York City this obelisk appears at Times Square). The obelisk is made out of concrete and steel and appears to be entirely hollow on the inside.</p><p>A man dressed in a white robe wearing a mask made out of concrete and steel will appear on top of the obelisk and begin reading an ancient text (which appears to date back to Babylonian times). This text will state:</p><p>When all language has failed, The One shall return. When all hope has left, he shall arrive. Sit back and enjoy his arrival! Countdown begins…</p><p>This text will continue to repeat for five minutes, after which another message will be printed on the obelisk's surface. According to all known messages in the world's languages, this message always reads: "New Year's Countdown". The next message printed on the obelisk's surface is different every year; it always reads "Happy New Year". However, these messages have become less accurate over time.</p><p>After several hours (or if a new message is printed), any human who comes within 500m of the obelisk will immediately die as a result of trauma consistent with arriving in international airspace at more than 5000 ft per second squared (0.0058 Mach). This location is heavily restricted due to large numbers of aircraft crashes and cases of hypoxia, hyperventilation agents must avoid all air traffic near SCP-443 when it is active unless they are prepared to decommission their aircraft.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-342 was first discovered on ██/01/2001, when a Foundation agent was sent to investigate a possible anomaly near ███████. Upon reaching the object, he reported that he could see a route through it. A radio transmission to Mobile Task Force Epsilon-7 (Mobile Task Force Omicron-7) was attempted; however, the signal was blocked by an unknown factor.</p><p>The following objects were observed traversing SCP-342 between the dates noted in brackets:</p>
