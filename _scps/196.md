<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-196</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-196 is contained within a Safe object chamber at Storage Site-████. SCP-196 is to be maintained as a group of 3 D-class personnel. Feeding times for the group will occur every 2 weeks. All three D-class personnel are to be kept ignorant of SCP-196's true nature.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-196 appears to be a wooden table which has the appearance of an old house plan. The table is comprised of 2 primary parts: a round top, 8 foot in diameter and 3 feet deep, with two matching legs spanning the width; and a rectangular base with two matching feet at the same size as the top section. A rectangular chute is located on the underside of the table, leading to a shaft below.</p><p>The chute leads into a large subterranean chamber where SCP-196's true anomalous property manifests. In this chamber, there are 4 doors on opposite sides of the room. Two of these doors lead to alternate rooms which each contain two additional instances of SCP-196 (designated SCP-196-1 through -4), which appear to be identical to their respective original instances.</p><p>If any D-class personnel are sent into this alternate room with an instance of SCP-196, they will begin eating it. However, no matter how much or how often these individuals eat, any trace of SCP-196 remains on their body within a few minutes afterwards. Despite this information being available to staff testing SCP-196, they have been unable to determine why they are unable to prevent themselves from eating it. Further testing is currently prohibited.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 196-1:</strong> SCP-196's true anomalous property was discovered when D-class personnel began to exhibit unusual behaviors during testing. It was noted that while they did not yet know they were eating SCP-196, they would eat it when presented with an instance. Interviews showed no cognitive dissonance concerning SCP-196's nature. Testing with D-class personnel revealed that SCP-196 could be eaten in any quantity without any adverse effects. Further testing on D-class personnel has been prohibited."]</p>
