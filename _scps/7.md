<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7 is to be contained in an 8 x 10 m cage. A standard diet and mineral supplement are to be provided daily; exercise may be conducted once a month, with approval of Level 2 personnel. Standard cleaning protocols are applicable, with the exception of "Bedsheets". Bedsheets are not to remain on SCP-7 for extended periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7 is a male adult polar bear (Ursus maritimus), about 50 kg in weight, bearing white fur. The Polar bear was originally captured by the Foundation on ██/██/19██ from the █████████████ Barren Lands of [REDACTED] using a remote aircraft.</p><p>When confined, SCP-7 displays no abnormal behaviour, reacting normally to any stimulus presented. However, when free in its enclosure, SCP-7 will attempt to "escape" its cage. Upon being subdued, SCP-7 will take up a specific pose: with his back against the wall of his enclosure and a ventilated cloth "collar" placed over his head, resembling a swaddling infant. Due to this pose, SCP-7 is given the designation "SCP-7's Boyhood".</p><p>When placed in this position for more than 5 minutes at a time, SCP-7 may be charged by any nearby animal. Said animals have been found to be member of the Canidae family. A state of partial hypothermia has been noted after approximately 45 minutes of contact with non-Canidae animals; this effect has not been noted with other mammals.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Log of Incident 7</p><p>On ██/██/19██, SCP-7 escaped its containment, taking up the aforementioned pose. Upon capture, SCP-7 was found to be partially rotted, with several blankets and a bedsheet over it. SCP-7 was returned to containment and the blankets removed, though the bedsheet was retained and stored. On ██/██/20██, SCP-7 was again found attempting to "escape" its enclosure; the containment team noted that the blankets had been shifted, and that a raw hide (presumably from a Canidae) had been placed on top of SCP-7.</p><p>The containment team attempted to return SCP-7 to its former position, but upon being placed into his prison, SCP-7 began to make sounds of distress. After approximately 15 minutes of this behaviour, SCP-7 stopped moving and began convulsing sporadically; by this point, the blankets and the hide were in tatters, revealing [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>On ██/██/20██ at 0200 hours, two Foundation aircraft were dispatched to recover SCP-7 from the █████████████ Barren Lands. A Foundation operative (Agent ██████) was killed in the process; on ██/██/20██ at 1200 hours, Agent ██████ was recovered as [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>The remaining agent reported that approximately 1 kilometre from their location, they had come upon a large cave choked with snow. Inside they found a makeshift pen constructed of tree trunks and branches; within this pen was a single adult male polar bear. Upon seeing the agent approaching, SCP-7 became agitated and charged at them aggressively; upon being subdued, SCP-7 resumed its previous pose.']</p>
