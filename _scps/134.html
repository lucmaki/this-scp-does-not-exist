<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-134</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-134 is contained in a 1mx1m concrete vault, which contains the following items:</p><p>Its containment procedures are largely inactive. Because it is so large, materials used to construct it have been altered beyond recognition and any item thrown at SCP-134 will simply disappear into it. The door is self-locking through the use of a key that can only be obtained by the entity of the same name.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-134 is a massive cube composed entirely of solid iron, and approximately 100 meters in exterior dimensions. It does not float, as it is not magnetized. It weighs an estimate of 450 metric tons (440 long tons; 450 short tons), is electrically neutral, has no known means of motion (although it can be pointed or spun like a normal cube) and shows no signs of aging.</p><p>It has been claimed to be the work of [REDACTED], but this was never verified. Its origin and creator are considered irrelevant by current containment procedures; it acts as though it were naturally occurring.</p><p>The only way to open SCP-134 is through the door located on its face. This door requires the entity of the name SCP-134 ("CHALLENGE DISRUPTIVE PAROLE") to possess the key and unlock it with a simple twist. When unlocked, any matter thrown against SCP-134 will disappear into its interior, which has been shown to be 3000 km in depth. When the door was first opened, there was no indication that it would go anywhere except for the first 90 meters inside the front face. Attempting to push on the walls or sides of the vault will have no effect; those attempting to break through have all failed in their attempts and claimed that "nothing will work".</p><p>The interior of SCP-134 contains several structures:</p><p>SCP-134 came online sometime after its initial containment, at which time its doors were observed to open themselves for no apparent reason. Over time, further sections of SCP-134 disappeared into itself until it became completely inaccessible save for the main vault door. The only exception to this was a section located on its lower right side (the former location of Keter). Over time its doors began opening without warning when they were closed, depositing entities inside until they were ejected again upon closing. As originally constructed, this feature was designed to prevent any unauthorized access to SCP-134's interior by requiring an entity possessing proper clearance for such actions before it could enter; however, due to environmental changes between initial activation and the beginning of testing at Site-██, this requirement was no longer viable by 2009.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
