<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-349</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-349 is to be contained in a standard containment cell at Site-77. A series of one hundred airlocks are to be constructed, and SCP-349 is to be kept in an airtight chamber with video monitoring in order to prevent any potential containment breaches. SCP-349 may only be removed from its chamber for testing purposes, with no more than two individuals participating.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-349 is an artifact made of a spherical object, approximately 20 centimeters in diameter, with a white ceramic surface. The surfaces are smooth, with no wear or tearing from use.</p><p>When exposed to an organism's heart, SCP-349 will sap the organ's power, causing it to slow down and eventually fail. In human subjects, this will occur due to the heart being unable to pump the blood fast enough. For the majority of the time where experimentation has been conducted, the subject has died due to the lack of their heart functioning within their body; however, there have been cases where CPR was performed, allowing the subject to survive until they were able to receive medical attention.1</p><p>SCP-349 can only gain power when exposed to a living heart. Attempts at using it on a non-living organ (such as a car's engine) have proven unsuccessful.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Testing Log 349-1</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 21/02/2019</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1778</p><p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Standard heart transplantation test</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> Subject was successfully transplanted with a healthy heart.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> SCP-349 caused the failed heart to stop working, resulting in the recipient's death. This is the only recorded case where SCP-349 caused a human subject to die.</p>
