<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-751</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-751 is contained in a standard containment cell at Site-16, with the exception of measurement sessions, in which it is to be temporarily located in a normal office space complex. The size of SCP-751 should be recorded by researchers and then adjusted to match with the CIA's standard mugshot requirements. Any measurements taken must be recorded using paper and pen, as any other method would result in the object producing additional anomalous effects.</p><p>The room containing SCP-751 should be monitored by closed circuit television from the patient monitoring station located within the room. Cameras should not compromise the entity's containment, but surveillance of the room may reveal changes in its appearance.</p><p>Approximately once every three months, two mobile Task Force Beta agents are to enter the containment area through a back door and remain there for two hours before exiting through another door. During this time, they are to photograph what they can of SCP-751-1 and report their findings to a physician on duty at Site 16's on-site medical facility. These individuals are to show no signs of knowledge of their assignment beforehand; all records of their presence must be expunged after their return.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-751 is a 6.5 m (21 ft) tall, 3.2 m (10.5 ft) wide, and 3.2 m (10.5 ft) deep object composed of bronze, iron and wood. When SCP-751 is moved, the object will instead produce a lengthy string or cord of varying length, hanging from it at the original point SCP-751 originally was located at. SCP-751 has been observed producing cords of variable lengths between 2.8–3.9 km (1.8–2.3 mi), with an average length of 3.6 km (2.2 mi). A small hole in the center of the rear of SCP-751 allows its internal mechanisms to be seen; these are currently unknown but are not visible when the object is under normal circumstances.</p><p>SCP-751 was first discovered in 1978 after reports of missing persons began surfacing in a remote region of Sweden (see Addendum for detail.) Following a short investigation into the area, police investigators removed their weapons from their sidearms and entered into what would later be determined to be a containment cell containing SCP-751; all officers were found alive, but unable to recall what had occurred while inside the cell. Multiple Foundation agents were flown to the scene, where they confirmed that officers were indeed within one of three containment chambers being used by the Foundation, but no anomalous objects were produced as a result of this containment failure. Several other containment cells had also been set up using similar methods, but all contained items which could normally be produced via the use of known Foundation technologies without causing any anomalous effects; all Foundation personnel present at the scene were given Class B amnestics before returning to Site-16's medical facility for examination.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong></p><p>On February █, 1978, a Foundation medical team consisting of Dr. Richard E. Tannenbaum, Dr. David L. Banks, Dr. James E. Anderson, Dr. Anne M. Burks, and Dr. Beatrice F. Hennigan arrived at the scene of the containment failure; it was determined that all participants were unaffected by any anomalous effects caused by the interaction between SCP-751 and the Foundation's containment methods, either during or after the event occurred. The Foundation then began a full investigation into the area, which continued until 1991, when Site Director ██████ authorized the use of Mobile Task Force Beta.</p><p>The Foundation was unable to determine what had occurred within SCP-751's containment cell, but did discover that it had been used as a location for a number of different anomalous events between 1978 and 1991. These events included:</p><p>The Foundation took no additional actions in regards to SCP-751 after its first containment failure; however, numerous other containment failures were reported in the years following, which were all attributed to SCP-751 after their occurrence and never related to SCP-751 prior to its initial discovery."]</p>
