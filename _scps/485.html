<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-485</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-485 has been allowed to remain in containment, however all personnel handling or using SCP-485 are required to wear waterproof gear while doing so. Due to the large number of objects that have fell victim to SCP-485, it is currently under containment in a separate facility.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-485 is a decorative novelty watch made of wood, glass and pewter. It is approximately 12 cm across with a leather strap. There are designs etched in the whimist doors and face of SCP-485, depicting what appear to be large sailing ships under full sail in a vast ocean.</p><p>SCP-485 will change its inscription upon being scratched, depending on the object that it has fallen victim to. The inscription will gradually change over several hours until the object where it fell victim has dissolved completely, typically after several days.</p><p>SCP-485 below-water level: SCP-485 will fall victim to an extensive number of objects before eventually reaching bottom. Objects that reach SCP-485 first will normally disappear quickly once they fall into it, with the exception being most liquid based objects such as water, sweat or saliva.</p><p>SCP-485 above-water level: After surfacing from underwater, SCP-485 will come in contact with the nearest source of moisture for several hours until it evaporates entirely. Any person affected by this process will have their memories wiped clean after falling victim to SCP-485, with any marks from the event wearing off 4 days afterwards - memory loss also applies to nearby personnel who have been affected by SCP-485.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-485 was recovered from The ██████'s ██████ ████████ ██████ hotel where it was found lodged in the ceiling, with many of the other objects that fell victim to SCP-485. It is believed that SCP-485 was used as a decoration to commemorate the ship's sinking, however it could not be determined if this was the case, due to the effects of SCP-485.</p>
