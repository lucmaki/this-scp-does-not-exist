<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-365</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation maintains a comprehensive security perimeter around SCP-365. Access to SCP-365 is prohibited to all unapproved personnel and any attempts to enter its area are to be immediately reported.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-365 is a complex network of underground tunnels and chambers located underneath an abandoned residential building in ███████, Iowa. SCP-365 does not appear to have been used for the past ██ years and consists of several interconnected rooms connected by metal walkways, doors, and a large ventilation system. Several locations within SCP-365 are permanently sealed with concrete.</p><p>In addition to a large number of tunnels leading to many different areas within SCP-365, SCP-365 appears to be centered around a single room (designated Site-365) consisting of three chambers connected by metal ramps. All three chambers contain rows of numbered lockers lining their walls and floors.</p><p>The center chamber is the only one which contains any significant change in design or contents. At the back of this room is a large metal door (designated SCP-365-B). When approached, the door can be remotely opened from the "outside" through an electronic pad inside Site-365. The door opens directly into Site-365's central chamber, where it is impossible to discern whether there is an actual door through which it is opening. If an object is placed on the electronic pad inside Site-365 and then dropped into the central chamber, it will enter SCP-365 through SCP-365-B regardless of how far the object has traveled from Site 365 once entering SCP-365. The item will pass directly through Site-365 and will appear to move at speed towards its original location.</p><p>It has been determined that accessing or retreating from subspace via Site 365 is safe as long as no objects are left behind. Any objects left behind will bypass Site 365 and appear at their original locations at the time they were left behind. It is unknown if these items could have interacted with another object while in subspace or what would happen if they did interact with another object during this time.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Following Incident 365-1, the use of SCP-365 is restricted to Testing and Research personnel with Level 4 clearance or above. Unauthorized access to Site-365 is to be reported immediately.']</p>
