<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-560</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-560 is to be contained within a large containment area at the ████████'s base. SCP-560 requires an individual that is biologically capable of sustained contact with air, preferably without their own air supply. The entrance to this area is to be barred by automated security systems, and access to the area itself is strictly prohibited. A system of airlocks have also been constructed around the outside of the containment area, with each one having a separate airlock to prevent SCP-560 from breaching containment.</p><p>Two persons are to be stationed within the containment area at all times, both of which must have no history of being exposed to SCPs before. All testing is to be approved by Dr. █████ prior to implementation. All personnel are to wear fully sealed HAZMAT suits while in the proximity of SCP-560 unless given clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-560 is a custom-built submarine that is 1.9 meters long and 56 kilograms in weight. No external markings have been found on SCP-560, although markings appear on the interior of the sub, indicating that it was built by a group known as "Underwater Technology Laboratory" (UNT Lab). The hull of the boat appears similar to an early era US Navy submarine, with a single torpedo storage tube on the rear of the craft and numerous holes, presumably for remote rerouting of air and/or water.</p><p>SCP-560 can generate a large amount of negative pressure within its outer casing; this pressure is able to displace any non-anomalous matter within a 50 meter radius of the craft. This inner containment area is filled with compressed air at approximately 15 kPa abs, which will continue pushing outwards forever unless the air within it is replaced or vented. A thin layer of lead paint and silicone sealant has been applied to prevent any leaks through the sub's hull.</p><p>When an individual enters SCP-560 for testing purposes for the first time, they will be surrounded by air and crewed by D-Class personnel which are embedded into the hull of SCP-560, becoming one with it after approximately 14 minutes of exposure to the vacuum. The aforementioned sealed suits protect against decompression sickness as well as allowing for space travel without exposing the wearer to vacuum; however, all suits remove oxygen from the body and therefore do not require an air supply once they are sealed. The location where these persons are located seems random; they have repeatedly been observed being located in different parts of the sub's interior, including among internal pipes that connect compartments throughout the craft.</p><p>The individuals inside SCP-560's interior will be unable to move from their position and will begin experiencing severe pain due to lack of O². The cause of this pain is unknown but likely relates to nitrogen narcosis, which causes disorientation and vomiting when exposed to high levels of O² for too long; additionally, there are instances where subjects who have spent extended amounts of time sealed away have become catatonic due to lack of O², having experienced severe hallucinations concerning their surrounding environment and feelings of extreme discomfort.</p><p>The only way out of SCP-560 is if an outside force such as a diving bell can thrust itself into its outer hull while fully submerged in order to plug up any leaks or breaches in its hull caused by decompression or damage.</p><p>Testing on sentient beings has proven effective at replicating conditions inside SCP-560, although these individuals require prolonged periods of exposure before actually being subject to a complete simulation; currently this is planned using D class personnel until further testing can be completed using volunteers residing at Site ██'s medical facility.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 560-1:</strong> Testing Log</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1028 - Human</p><p><strong>Testing Method:</strong> Subject was sealed within SCP-560 and remained there indefinitely through the use of airlocks.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject began to experience severe pain from nitrogen narcosis, eventually becoming catatonic and experiencing hallucinations due to lack of O².</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1028 - Human</p><p><strong>Testing Method:</strong> Subject was sealed within SCP-560 and remained there indefinitely through the use of airlocks.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject was placed within a diving bell containing a complete atmosphere of O² and remained conscious and able to speak, communicating with personnel stationed on the surface for several hours until being ejected from the diving bell.

During this time, all exterior air supply was removed from SCP-560 via the airlock and replaced with compressed air that maintained an internal pressure at approximately 15 kPa abs.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject was placed within a diving bell containing a complete atmosphere of O² and remained conscious and able to speak, communicating with personnel stationed on the surface for several hours until being ejected from the diving bell. Subject reported feelings of extreme discomfort but otherwise unharmed. After being removed from the diving bell, Subject reported feeling like "a warm, wet rag" for an extended period of time, before finally being completely restored to normal.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1307 - Human</p><p><strong>Testing Method:</strong> Subject was placed within an enclosed diving bell containing only an atmosphere of O² and remained conscious and able to speak, communicating with personnel stationed on the surface for several hours until being ejected from the diving bell. Subject reported feeling extreme discomfort due to lack of oxygen but otherwise unharmed.
