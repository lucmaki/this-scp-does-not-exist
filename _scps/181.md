<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-181</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-181 is to be kept in a storage tank of pure sulfuric acid, located in the underground Sector-23 "Aquatic Containment" facility at Site-77. A small door has been cut into the side of the drum, and two small viewing windows have been installed above it; these are protected by several layers of thick plexiglass and equipped with area-dispersal airlocks. The door has been covered by a tarpaulin to prevent its accidental removal. The door is to remain closed while SCP-181 is being used.</p><p>The tank is to be filled with water as needed, and no more than 1/10 of its surface area (0.1m²) may be unused at any given time. The tank is to be cleaned daily with dry chlorine bleach and vacuumed weekly for parasites and aquatic insects, but it is important that the level of acidity does not decrease either from evaporation or from leakage. Water added to SCP-181 must be pure distilled water; the tank's gauges will ensure this.</p><p>The tank's inner walls are lined with copper mesh to keep marine life from entering the liquid. The tanks outer shell is made of lead, painted black and capped with an aluminum cap for aesthetics.</p><p>The chamber housing SCP-181 must be kept at a constant temperature of 35°C, as measured with a thermometer inside the containment. This is a secondary reason for using distilled water; it also prevents condensation on the interior walls, which can upset its delicate chemical balance. Temperature humidity sensors are affixed in the corners of each wall, and the room temperature controller shuts down power if they reach danger levels. This automatic safety feature ensures that any abnormal heat within the chamber will cause both electricity and water flow through emergency valves until the problem is fixed, at which point power will resume operation. Even if natural ventilation fails due to an anomaly within the site, an auxiliary fan can provide sufficient ventilation until emergency repairs can be made.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-181 is a saltwater fish tank, built in 1972 by a Plymouth, MA based company. It is approximately 3.2m x 3.2m x 2m, made of solid steel (not steel frame), and has six individual compartments; called "rooms" in Foundation parlance.</p><p>The first two rooms are for non-aquatic species such as crabs, lobsters and small fish. The third room contains the water intake and filter system. The fourth has a saltwater intertidal tank that can be used for sea anemones or starfish. The fifth room is where SCP-181 itself rests in a glass-reinforced metal case with a locking mechanism. The sixth room is where the tank's interior can be viewed through the viewing port on its door, and also serves as the supplementary filtration area for SCP-181's use.</p><p>However, this is not the main anomalous property of SCP-181; that power seems to come from something within its own structure rather than any external source — though this has never been proven conclusively.</p><p>Whenever SCP-181 is observed to be moving, even at a slow pace, it will produce high amplitude vibrations in all six of its rooms simultaneously. At higher speeds these vibrations are increased in strength. Besides this effect, SCP-181 has no real other anomalies except its unique method of movement; which appears to be propelled by small electrical motors in each compartment that activate when needed, not just when its owner stands within range of them but also upon being touched.</p><p>SCP-181 was discovered after reports of unusual gyrations within a marine aquarium shop were passed along to the local police department in 1971, which promptly dispatched agents to investigate. They found only several smaller tanks displaying marine life according to normal standards, but with highly amplified sounds coming from them. Upon questioning the owner about the source of these noises he asked for an agent to demonstrate how his tanks moved, whereupon all six tanks spontaneously moved across the store's floor into his arms and against his body at speeds beyond human perception. He subsequently began working with Foundation personnel and given amnestics.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 181-01:</strong> SCP-181 is highly energetic and its owner is very protective of it; he has been known to fight with Foundation personnel, usually when they suggest that it be moved from its current location. While this behavior could possibly be attributed to some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), it is highly likely that his actions are directly related to his relationship with SCP-181.']</p>
