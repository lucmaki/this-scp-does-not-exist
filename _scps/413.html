<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-413</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All information regarding SCP-413 must be concealed from the general public. It is to be kept in a secure storage facility until further notice, when it will be contained in an SCP in a similar manner.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-413 refers to a life and death manifestation where a human subject is hypothetically granted access to all knowledge of life. If a human subject is not in possession of that knowledge, it is impossible for them to understand anything in their current lifetime. If, however, a human subject is capable of understanding everything that they are aware of, they will return immediately to the previous point - time (if they are aware of this, they are capable) without any memory of partaking in the experience.</p><p>SCP-413 was initially discovered by an agent working on a study regarding post-mortem memory retention in humans. The subject successfully manifested as described above and disappeared. The disappearance was noted as unexplained and was linked to an unidentified manor. A unit consisting of thirteen agents was sent to investigate the mansion and locate what had occurred. The agents found no sign of the subject until one week later when one agent touched the wall and discovered five words written there from the perspective of the subject: Life and Death.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
