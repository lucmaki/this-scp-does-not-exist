<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-494</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-494 has no current containment procedures due to being an urban legend. Any reports of SCP-494 are to be ignored by the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-494 is a house located in [REDACTED]. SCP-494 has a history of being accessed by several entities who remain undetected.</p><p>SCP-494 is home to a family consisting of three adults, two children, and two dogs. The occupants of the house will always open their doors and windows to allow the entry of any individual to their home.</p><p>Attempts to apprehend or destroy SCP-474 have proven futile without prior research on the entity. Upon reaching adulthood, individuals that are granted entry into SCP-474's home will be granted the abilities of a demigod upon death. The residence has shown to contain several items that correlate with the mythologies of many nations around the world.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-494 was discovered to be inhabited by a humanoid entity of unknown origin. The entity was terminated upon discovery. The following is a list of the entities that were recorded entering into SCP-494's residence.</p><p>The entities listed below are no longer residing within SCP-494's residence."]</p>
