<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-268</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-268 is to be stored at Containment Locker 66. The locker contains no additional measures for containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-268 is the upper torso of a female adult human, 1.95 m in height. SCP-268's head was never recovered and cannot be reattached to its body.</p><p>SCP-268 has a structure similar to that of a human spine (it has no cartilage or bone), but with significantly more vertebrae. The upper half of SCP-268's body has been extensively dissected by Dr. ███ and is mainly composed of muscle tissue with some bone in certain locations.</p><p>SCP-268 always trails behind its victims during any motor activity. SCP-268 appears to use this trail as an anchor for its movements, though it is difficult to determine whether it is an active pursuit or simply an over-compensating attempt to keep up. SCP-268 can extend itself upwards towards the ceiling at will; however, when not using this ability to escape, it will act as if it is unable to stretch beyond a certain point, such as reaching the underside of a doorway or stretching far enough to straddle two chairs without actually occupying both chairs at once.</p><p>SCP-268 has fleshy tentacles that are presumably used for grasping and manipulating objects, although their function is currently unknown. When attached to another person, these tend toward areas where the person would have difficulty reaching without assistance or leverage from SCP-268. For example, the tentacle attached to the left side of the back of Agent ██████'s neck would be positioned almost directly under the back of his jaw if he were able to move at all on his own while carrying SCP-268.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On 15/08/████, SCP-268 had been following a team of security personnel from Site-███ around Site-███'s satellite facility. SCP-268 was given a Class-B amnestic and returned to Containment Locker 66. A full document of this incident is attached.</p><p>Incident 268-█-██</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The following is a log of an incident that took place at Site-███'s satellite facility, Site-███-33, on 15/08/████.</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Agent ██████:</strong> Alright, people, site is secure. All personnel report in.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> I'm here.</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Agent ██████:</strong> Okay, we're clear. Let's head back to the main facility.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> How can you tell?</p><p><strong>Agent ██████:</strong> I've got eyes, dude. You're looking at them right now.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> They're moving too quickly to be birds.</p><p><strong>Agent ████████████:</strong> Yeah, they're on the move again. Can we stop them?</p><p><strong>Agent ████████████:</strong> Look at that! It's stretching like crazy!</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> Oh my god… it's going up the ceiling!</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Agent ██████████:</strong> What the fuck? That thing just fucking disappeared! Wait… where are its tentacles?!</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Agent ██████████:</strong> It's gone, man! It's gone! Fuck!</p><p><strong>Agent ██████████████:</strong> It's behind us! It's behind us!</p><p><strong>Agent ██████████████:</strong> I can't see it… I can't see it… no more, please… no more!</p><p><strong>Agent ██████████████:</strong> I don't want to die, man… I don't want to die… no more, please no more… [gurgling sounds]</p><p>[END LOG]</p>
