<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-580</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-580 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with a human suicide prevention device. The device is to be removed and cleaned in order to avoid any potential complications from SCP-580's effect on the human body. SCP-580 may be handled only by Class-D personnel who are under the influence of anti-anxiety medication, due to the adverse effects of SCP-580 on those already prone to stress. If it is necessary for testing, staff members must always be wearing full protective equipment during their interactions with SCP-580.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-580 is a black obsidian stone similar to a cat's eye. The surface of SCP-580 is unmarked, with no signs of erosion or weathering. The item does not appear to respond to the human touch, but to be more resistant than mineralized items of the same composition. It is 20 cm long and 8 cm across at its widest point.</p><p>When touched by a human, SCP-580 will begin to emit a bright red glow, pulsating in intensity and frequency. This effect will continue indefinitely as long as the item is held by the affected individual. This effect also appears to be universal in terms of gender and ethnicity; all humans who have handled SCP-580 will exhibit this effect. If a person attempts to withdraw their hand from SCP-580, the glow intensifies and will continue until the hand makes physical contact with the item again. However, if the affected individual passes out or dies, the effect will immediately cease.</p><p>The effects of SCP-580 can be reversed by exposing it to sunlight for 15 seconds. Exposure to sunlight for longer than this will permanently alter SCP-580's properties; further testing has thus far not been possible due to these results.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-580 was discovered in ██████, Washington by Agent ██████ reading a book entitled "The Blood Moon Ritual" by [REDACTED]. Agents ██████ and █████████ then arrived at the scene and apprehended the two subjects, who were apprehended on suspicion of murder. When questioned, the subjects claimed that they had known each other for years and that the ritual had been prearranged beforehand. The subjects were then brought to Site-██ and detained until after the results of their interrogation could be reviewed.</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Subject 1 (Male, Caucasian, age 19), Interviewer: Agent ██████</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So what did you do?</p><p><strong>Subject 1:</strong> I didn\'t do anything. I just went over there and we started talking.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Oh, did you know him before?</p><p><strong>Subject 1:</strong> No, not really. I\'ve seen him around town when I\'m out doing stuff. I just… I guess I just wanted to talk to someone.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you think he had some sort of motive or reason for doing this?</p><p><strong>Subject 1:</strong> He said it was a ritual or something. It wasn\'t supposed to kill us, just make them feel better or something.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What about you? Why\'d you go along with it?</p><p><strong>Subject 1:</strong> I didn\'t have a choice. He told me if I didn\'t go along with it, he\'d kill my family.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What happened next?</p><p><strong>Subject 1:</strong> I just followed him into the woods behind his house… I wasn\'t really paying much attention to where he was taking me. But he stopped and pulled out a knife, told me to kneel down in front of him and tell him if I loved him. I mean, it seemed like something he would say. And he was saying that he loved me too, so… yeah, okay, fine.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What happened then?</p><p><strong>Subject 1:</strong> He cut my hand and told me to tell him if it hurt. Then he sliced my other hand too. Then he asked me if I loved him again; yea, well that\'s what I got for agreeing to do this stupid ritual. We hugged for a second, and then he slit my throat too.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How did you feel afterwards?</p><p><strong>Subject 1:</strong> Horrible. Like being ripped apart from the inside out. It hurt so bad that I thought it would tear my body apart. But then it just went away after a few minutes, like it was never there at all. It\'s not even like flowers die or anything; it\'s just gone like it never existed at all. That\'s how I feel now whenever I think about what happened; like my life is nothing but a dream of a screwed up guy who doesn\'t really matter anymore. And even though the blood moon ritual isn\'t real or anything, I still wish he\'d come back so that I could feel something again.</p>
