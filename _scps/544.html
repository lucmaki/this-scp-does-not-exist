<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-544</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-544 is to be stored in a standard containment locker. No testing is allowed with SCP-544. SCP-544 is to be wiped down with ammonia solution at least once per week, the remaining debris is to be disposed of in an approved incinerator.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-544 is a short, unassuming three-stringed lyre (or "cordophone") with a total of 61 strings. SCP-544 has no visible holes or surfaces, and when an individual attempts to grasp it in their hand, they instead perceive a "familiar tactile sensation" of an object they are familiar with. SCP-544's strings are not stiff, and instead have the same material properties as human skin. SCP-544 is flexible enough to be folded up into a flat disc with rounded edges.</p><p>When played, SCP-544 produces sounds that are very similar to the native language of whoever was playing before it was played. This does not occur in any wooden instrument or instrument that does not produce its own sound; when played by an unknown musician, the sounds produced are not similar in any manner.</p><p>SCP-544 was recovered from a home in ███████ Villages, England after reports of domestic abuse were received by local authorities, who later found ██ bodies buried in the basement bedroom. Autopsy reports positively identified each of the deceased persons as being elderly and having been dead for approximately several months at time of death, based on decomposition and other factors. The living room was void of furniture and other belongings besides SCP-544.</p><p>If an individual is acquainted with anything native to the Caucasian languages group (such as English), then they can sense its presence when holding SCP-544.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
