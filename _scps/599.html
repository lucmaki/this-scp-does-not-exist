<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-599</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-599 is currently contained at Site-42, located within the former naval base of the United States of America. A site has been constructed around SCP-599 with a perimeter fence equipped with motion detectors. Foundation agents stationed within the Coast Guard are instructed to monitor interdiction efforts and capture any attempts at contact from SCP-599.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-599 designates the USS Arizona, a United States Navy battleship that was sunk during World War II and is currently listed as a U.S. National Historic Landmark in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p><p>SCP-599 has the ability to effectively communicate with any human who navigates their location by way of boat. Psychological interviews have revealed that SCP-599 will display memories from its time with each individual person who enters its containment facility; these memories are inconsistent in their detail and period of time, despite inconsistencies in these details being present in all such memories. The only consistent factor among all memories is that they involve conversations involving the sinking of the USS Arizona on December 7, 1941.1</p><p>Attempts at communication on behalf of individuals who are not believed to be descendants of those lost on the USS Arizona have thus far failed to result in any information being conveyed to any personnel involved. When a subject's belief in their ancestry is validated, SCP-599 will display a specific memory connected with that individual. These memories typically lack significant detail and consist of fragments of historical documents or diary entries, often lacking more than two sentences before the subject expresses uncertainty regarding their meaning.</p><p>Individuals born after 1952 are not able to communicate with SCP-599 regardless of whether or not they believe themselves to be descendants of those lost on the USS Arizona.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
