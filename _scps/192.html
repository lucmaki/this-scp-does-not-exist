<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-192</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid (AL</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-192 is held in a standard biohazard containment unit at the Mobile Task Force base. Samples of SCP-192's tissue must be collected and stored in borosilicate glass vials, each protected from extreme temperatures by a titanium spring clip. Samples are to be removed from storage weekly and placed in cryogenic storage units for continued growth. Cryogenic units must be regularly checked for leaks; as of █/█/19██, two such leaks were detected and contained.</p><p>Any sample of SCP-192 that enters an anomalous phase of growth or demonstrates an unresponsive state of mind or body may be placed into a </p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-192 is an adult human female, physically unremarkable except for a prominent tumor on the left side of her neck. The tumor is roughly spherical in shape, weighing ten pounds and measuring three feet in diameter. This growth has not been observed to lose mass, despite the woman's attempts to remove it.</p><p>SCP-192 is also unresponsive to all forms of stimulus. When placed in environments with patterns of sound or tactile stimuli normally encountered by humans, SCP-192's lack of reaction has been observed to be either consistent or increasing in intensity.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 192-1:</strong> SCP-192 was recovered on ██/██/1956 in a small town in ██████, [REDACTED]. The woman was living in a hovel, surrounded by garbage and animal droppings. SCP-192's lack of response to external stimuli was noted immediately following the discovery of her; she has continued in this state of mindlessness to date."]</p>
