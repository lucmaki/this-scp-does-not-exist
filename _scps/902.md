<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-902</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As it is currently believed that there are no other "sculptures" of this kind, Foundation agents embedded within the Parisian art world have been assigned to monitor any similar stories and remove them from circulation.</p><p>Over the years, many reports of theft have been reported in connection with SCP-902. All such reports will be investigated thoroughly and the object recovered by use of covert gunmen by Mobile Task Force Omega-4 ("The Men in Black"). Sufficient evidence of vandalism or theft will be compared to more recent footage from cameras set out to monitor SCP-902's history. The result will allow recovered SCP-902 objects to be identified as originating from the private collection of a Foundation cover identity.</p><p>Though most art historians believe SCP-902 was not purchased but rather acquired through donation or an unaccounted gift, its true origin remains unknown and undetermined.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-902 is a modern sculpture coming from the early 20th century (c. 1910-1929) that depicts an unidentified character sitting at a desk, writing or drawing. SCP-902 has no discernable origins or previous owners.</p><p>Since its discovery and installation in a public art gallery in Paris, SCP-902 has been reported to be stolen and later returned in exchange for small amounts of cash or other valuables. In addition, numerous attempts to damage SCP-902 have been reported; the first such effort resulted in [REDACTED].</p><p>Note: All information regarding SCP-902's history prior to its discovery outside of Foundation control is classified under Level Omega.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Research has revealed that SCP-902's history is not as simple as it first appeared.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The following has been redacted for security reasons.</p><p>A Foundation agent embedded within the Parisian art world (who had previously been assigned to SCP-902) acquired a short video from a camera across the street from SCP-902. It was later determined that the camera had been installed in order to monitor the sculpture. The video, shown below, was sent to [REDACTED].</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The following is also redacted for security reasons.</p><p>The footage shows a man (later identified as [REDACTED]) exiting the gallery and walking around the corner to the caf√© across the street. He then exits his clothes and walks into the gallery wearing only a white robe with a hood. After drawing several lines on the wall with a black marker, he begins to write on the wall in an unknown language. Several minutes later, he exits the gallery and walks towards the street.</p><p>He walks past several people walking by and does not appear to recognize any of them. He is then seen speaking with another man who, like [REDACTED], wears a plain white robe. They speak for several minutes before [REDACTED] walks back into the gallery carrying several large bags of various sizes.</p><p>They both exit the building after [REDACTED] leaves, and [REDACTED] returns to his original clothing. He then sits down at the table from which he originally emerged from and appears to have a discussion with someone else before leaving again. As of now, no other person matching the description of [REDACTED] has been found."]</p>
