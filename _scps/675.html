<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-675</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-675 is to be kept in the Site-19 cafeteria. Any staff wishing to interact with SCP-675 is to be advised to wear lead aprons and gloves. All personnel interacting with SCP-675 must have a current flu shot.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-675 is a desk lamp, bearing a stylized latin script reading “LUX”. SCP-675 is capable of sitting on its own and will attempt to do so for any free surface within the immediate vicinity. SCP-675 does not seem to require power in order to function, though it will produce light from its familiar yellow coloration regardless of whether or not it receives adequate energy.</p><p>When a human being stands within roughly 2 meters of SCP-675, SCP-675 will activate and slowly begin animating its lampshade while humming the first four notes of the tune 'Ode to Joy' by Beethoven. The individual will remain animate for as long as they are near SCP-675.</p><p>Individuals affected by SCP-675 are incapable of physically moving more than 50 cm away from the nearest wall or other solid surface; at no point has the movement been able to reach greater than 0 cm. Although this effect is effective on an individual located at a distance far enough away to not be in visual contact with a solid surface provided that one can see their hands, individuals generally have little trouble distributing weight between their legs and feet instead of placing additional stress on muscles through which blood must flow. In most cases (83% of all attempts) individuals affected by SCP-675 can also remain standing when lacking any real physical support for their torso or limbs (approximating their normal gait in such circumstances). However, although unaffected by gravity, these individuals are never able to become airborne in any manner. In almost all cases, affected individuals have no difficulty maintaining bodily control despite lack of muscle tone or sensory feedback.</p><p>The most common method for exiting this animation is for affected individuals to sit down, taking care not to lean on anything with more mass than themself in order to keep their legs under them and keeping one arm raised in front of them as a physical barrier to prevent touching the floor. This prevents prasing while remaining upright; however, this also prevents loss of balance due to decreased force being put upon the skull and spinal column, which many subjects express chagrin over while occupying this animation state.</p><p>Although some subjects report feeling intense boredom while imbedded in this state, many subjects simply appear fascinated by the process and tend to spend most of their time observing it rather than interacting with it directly. It has been observed that subject's eyes will often become fixated on biological structures such as eyes or ears when not fully occupied by patterns projected upon them (such as shadows projected from objects nearby).</p><p>Subjects are able to communicate normally once freed from this animation mode and consequently rarely report issues with vocalization during this period of time.</p><p>For the purposes of testing, D-Class personnel have been given clothing and instructed to enter containment area wearing fully enclosed suits equipped with recording devices; ██ D-Class personnel have been successfully recovered with successful computer playback functioning on ██ occasions where tests were conducted under supervision only.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>The following is a log of SCP-675's effect when it was used to test the effects of SCP-███ in the presence of D-Class personnel.</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 2006/05/16</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-5618, female, 21 years old.</p><p><strong>Interaction time:</strong> 12 minutes, 59 seconds.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> Subject was instructed to enter containment area while wearing a full body suit which was equipped with a recording device and connected to a projector capable of projecting 3-dimensional models onto the surface of the subject's body.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> The subject appeared to begin slowly wandering towards the perimeter of the containment area, pausing occasionally to inspect various objects in the vicinity. After approximately 30 seconds, the subject appeared to begin inspecting its own hands. The subject remained in this state for approximately 2 minutes before beginning to inspect its feet (similar to previous interaction). This interaction continued for a total of 5 minutes before the subject began to examine its face and throat. After 5 minutes, the subject became noticeably agitated and began attempting to leave its containment area by pushing against the walls and floor. At this point, D-5618 was instructed to cease all actions and return to her original position.</p><p>D-5618 was then instructed to sit down on the floor, take one arm and place it across their chest to block any potential movement from that side. The subject then attempted to remove their suit from their head, but was unable to move their neck out of line with their spine due to lack of muscle control. D-5618 attempted to lift up on one leg while lying down in an attempt to avoid touching the ground; repeatedly, this was met with failure as their joints simply failed without any visible reason. Attempting to stand up proved similarly unsuccessful, with legs failing at nearly every joint until one successfully remained standing while using only one leg. The subject remained standing at this point for approximately 10 minutes before appearing distressed, staggering around and eventually collapsing onto their back. The subject then remained prone on the floor for approximately 1 minute before trying to stand up again. After approximately 3 minutes of unsuccessful attempts at holding themselves up, D-5618 leaned over onto their right shoulder; during this attempt, D-5618 lost grip on their left arm and fell over onto their left shoulder, injuring themselves upon contact with the ground.</p><p>After being helped up by a nearby staff member, D-5618 was placed in a seated position facing away from the nearest wall and instructed not to move for the remainder of testing period. After approximately 6 minutes, D-5618 appeared to begin exhibiting symptoms consistent with muscle atrophy and increased fatigue (see Addendum 23). A further 1 minute later, D-5618 began exhibiting several involuntary twitches around the eyes and mouth area; these were documented by Foundation staff present as causing exaggerated eye movements in response to no stimuli present. Approximately 4 minutes after the end of testing, D-5618 began leaning forward slightly and raising both arms above their head (approximating an 'O' shape) before falling unconscious.</p><p>D-5618 regained consciousness upon being removed from testing area and later reported feeling considerably more fatigued than usual.</p>
