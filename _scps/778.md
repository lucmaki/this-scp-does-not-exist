<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-778</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-778 is contained in Leather Material Containment Chamber (LMC) #27 located on Site-77. LMC #27 has been fitted with a steel door, concrete foundation, and anti-elevator measures to prevent access by unauthorized personnel. Personnel entering LMC #27 must wear Level 3 Biohazard Protection Suits, Hazmat Vests, and Personal Air Filters. The interior of LMC #27 is to be painted with black paint to aid in blending with surrounding walls and floors.</p><p>Prior to experimentation on SCP-778 and any other SCPs that bear similar properties, all personnel entering LMC #27 are required to undergo a psychological evaluation conducted by a psychiatrist or psychologist. Any civilian who encounters SCP-778 for the first time must undergo an examination for anomalous behavior as well. If such behavior is found, the individual must be admitted to a psychiatric facility under appropriate legal authority.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-778 is presumed to be identical in shape, mass, and composition to the leather pouch of a ████ brand leather bag. SCP-778 is covered in a thin layer of crude cement. The surface of SCP-778 is very smooth without any markings or engravings on its surface. The interior of SCP-778 does not appear to possess any air or other natural gas presence. The interior of SCP-778 displays a unique, organic interior composed of an unknown organic compound with properties similar to living tissue and muscle fibers. A large variety of organic compounds were observed upon analysis by Foundation investigators, but DNA has failed to prove the compound and origins of the material found within SCP-778 despite extensive genetic testing.</p><p>When exposed to oxygen, water vapor, or other naturally occurring gas compounds, the interior structure of SCP-777 [DATA EXPUNGED] (SCP-778) will aggressively consume or secrete all compounds present into itself and expel a small amount of the absorbed compounds. As such, SCP-778 remains dormant as long as it remains isolated from oxygen and water vapor exposure.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-778 is currently contained in an LMC #27 that contains a single air supply. On the first ██/██/████, Dr. ██████ entered LMC #27 for the first time. Dr. ██████ immediately reported that he could not locate any visible air or other gas sources in the interior of LMC #27 and that flames were burning within its interior. Dr. ██████ proceeded to perform a series of tests on SCP-778 and was able to determine that the flames were originating from the interior of SCP-778 itself. A small sample of SCP-778 was retrieved from within LMC #27 by Dr. ██████ with the assistance of a mechanical arm before the interior of LMC #27 completely collapsed.</p><p>Upon examination of the sample, it was discovered that the interior of SCP-778 was continually growing, consuming, and expelling smaller samples of organic compounds until a larger sample of SCP-778 was obtained.']</p>
