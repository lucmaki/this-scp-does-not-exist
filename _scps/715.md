<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-715</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Regular searches of the area are to be conducted by Foundation Agent Gregory.</p><p>Following Incident 715-A, all oil refineries within a 300 km radius of SCP-715 have been to be razed, and all oil pipelines within a 200km radius have been fully decommissioned. A series of armed patrols have been placed near SCP-715 for the purpose of preventing civilian access, as well as monitoring for anomalies related to SCP-715.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-715 is an anomalous phenomenon located in the southwestern portion of the San Joaquin Valley, California. SCP-715 does not have a fixed location, but has been recorded to appear at various locations, including ██████, [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>SCP-715 is primarily a blue powder that resembles airborne pollen. When inhaled through the nose, SCP-715 will cause mild euphoria to those within three hundred meters of it, as well as a slight increase in physical strength. Emotional damage seems to be significantly muted by exposure to SCP-715.</p><p>SCP-715 was first observed on ██/██/1972, when a sample was found on the roof of ██████ Gas and Oil Company's (███) Oil Refinery in Maricopa County, Arizona. The Foundation managed to prevent any civilian casualties from the initial site of exposure.</p><p>Shortly after the initial discovery of SCP-715, blood samples were taken from ██ individuals in southern California. The purpose of these samples was not discovered until later; however, due to a lack of immediate risk during this period, these samples were never administered to other members of humanity.</p><p>On ██/██/1973, an incident involving one member of SCP-███ took place in the town of ██████, California. An individual there claimed that he had ingested SCP-715 and that he had gained telekinetic powers due to it. This individual was later interviewed by Dr. █████ and showed no signs of enhancement beyond what already occurred from consuming SCP-715 prior to starting his experiments with it. This individual's report allowed for the testing of SCP-715's effects on humans for further study.</p><p>Two months later, on ██/██/1973 in ██████, California, 11 individuals began displaying similar abilities (namely being able to levitate small objects). These individuals were identified as SCP-715 victims; however all 11 distinct increases in power had an uncommon origin: most mutations occurred when a victim attempted to demonstrate their powers for others for the first time. Some victims utilized their newfound abilities in more violent manners; this resulted in Drs. █████ and █████ trying to find out how and why these changes occurred several weeks later on ██/██/1973.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 715-A:</strong> Incident 715-A (6/12/1973): In ██/██/1973, eleven individuals, ranging in age from █ to ██ years of age and residing in three different cities in California, were found to have undergone a total of ██ changes that would normally take place over the course of █ years. The majority of these changes were related to telekinesis, while others were related to other abilities and even brain structures.</p><p>Following the initial increase in power, all eleven patients began showing slight signs of insanity; these symptoms were most often violent tendencies or dementia. It is unknown whether or not these symptoms are related to SCP-715's effects or if they were a result of the initial changes occurring so quickly.</p><p>After the initial increase in power, the patients began exhibiting sudden increases in strength and cognitive abilities. The first victim in Maricopa County was able to lift a steel beam weighing ██\xa0kg by himself, which was used to block the entrance of a gas leak into the oil refinery. After this incident, all eleven patients began using their newfound abilities for more useful purposes, such as lifting large objects to block gas leaks and using their increased strength to help repair the damage caused by the initial outburst by SCP-715.</p><p>The initial outburst was then followed by the discovery of SCP-715 on the roof of the ██████ Gas and Oil Company's (███) Oil Refinery in Maricopa County, Arizona. This event occurred shortly after Agent ███████ discovered William ████████'s report detailing how he had gained telekinetic powers after ingesting SCP-715."]</p>
