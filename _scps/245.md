<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-245</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation respons teams are to maintain a constant surveillance of critical infrastructure, as well as monitor national news outlets for any mention of SCP-245. If such reports are detected, agents are to retrieve copies of the reports and disseminate them through media outlets or political influence.</p><p>In the event SCP-245 becomes uncontainable, amnestics are to be distributed to local residents and recorded media is to be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-245 is a phenomenon which causes minor alterations to the flow of information. It works by making false claims about events or entities, causing subsequent reports to be interpreted as true when they are not. These false claims are usually isolated facts and therefore do not affect the overall perception of reality.</p><p>It is currently unknown how SCP-245 achieves its effect, but it has been observed to work on both human and non-human observers. Human observers have proven to be affected by SCP-245 in slightly different ways depending on their level of knowledge about the subject at hand. For example, an average citizen might be incorrectly informed that a major city had been attacked by terrorists, while a political expert would be informed that [DATA EXPUNGED]. The level of inaccuracy varies widely, but can still affect people if enough time passes between exposure and knowledge of the actual facts.</p><p>As with all phenomena of this nature, SCP-245 will wear off over time, eventually resulting in only partial awareness of what was formerly known as reality.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong> Following the outbreak of World War III, Foundation agents were able to successfully cover up the event. While many details had to be altered, a large number of newspapers and news broadcasts were able to be altered to reflect the facts as they actually transpired. However, the event rapidly faded from public memory and little else was done to prevent the war from becoming even more widespread than it already was. The only exceptions are SCP-245-A instances, which at least partially retain memories of the events.']</p>
