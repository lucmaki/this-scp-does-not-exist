<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-261</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-261 is contained in a sealed container. Containment is to be maintained at a temperature of -76 °C, which ensures that the uranium isotope 238U remains unchanged.</p><p>As SCP-261 is contained within a standard containment chamber, it should also not be affected by radiation; however, personnel performing maintenance on SCP-261 should wear lead aprons.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-261 is a 1 kg plastic jug, which contains a mixture of uranium metal, nickel metal and plastic. Testing with SCP-261 indicates that the uranium isotopes 238U and 238Pb also exist in an undisturbed state within SCP-261.</p><p>When SCP-261 is heated to a temperature over 60 °C, it will emit radioactive isotopes from its surface at a rate of approximately 1.7 mSv per hour. Analysis of the radioactivity indicates that those isotopes originate from approximately half of 238U and all of 238Pb; this is sufficient to indicate whether or not the material in the container is radioactive.</p><p>Any substance which comes into contact with SCP-261 will be affected to a change in physical characteristics which can be identified as anomalous. For example, when steel wool is rubbed against the surface of SCP-261, it will lose its abrasive properties. However, since it retains its metallic properties, steel wool will not be able to bond with the altered object if brought into contact with it.</p><p>SCP-261 was recovered from the ████████ scrapyard on ██/██/199█ following reports of several sightings of scrap vehicles spontaneously disassembling. The above information was recorded during Foundation surveillance of several employees in the scrapyard on the day of recovery.</p>
