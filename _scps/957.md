<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-957 is a humanoid entity with a physical appearance resembling that of an adult female. SCP-957 is approximately 2 meters tall and weighs approximately 75 kilograms. SCP-957's body is composed of a type of metallic alloy which has been described as appearing similar in composition to that of titanium, but appears to be more similar to steel. SCP-957's body appears to be heavily armored and possesses a number of protrusions on its surface, including but not limited to:</p><p>SCP-957 was recovered from ████████, ██, in the aftermath of a violent riot where within the space of half an hour, over one thousand civilians had disappeared. Further investigation demonstrated that the area surrounding ████████ had been significantly affected by a previously unknown event; this event was designated SCP-957-A.</p><p>According to eyewitness accounts, the event began at approximately 11:30 GMT on ██/██/██, when several hundred civilians had gathered outside the town hall building, protesting against a politician who was scheduled to speak at an upcoming town meeting. According to eyewitness accounts, shortly after this group had begun to march towards the town hall, hundreds of residents from nearby buildings appeared from seemingly nowhere and began attacking the protesters with clubs and improvised weapons. The witnesses claim that these individuals were wearing no clothing or identifying marks and were able to attack the protesters without apparent provocation or any form of communication between them and those they attacked. Despite this, witnesses report that the attacks did not result in immediate death or injury; instead, all victims disappeared without trace after being struck by their attackers. All witnesses claim that they believed these disappearances resulted from the teleportation process that occurs naturally during teleportation, though they also acknowledge they have no way of substantiating this belief.</p><p>During the ensuing riot and subsequent police response, over three hundred civilians emerged from buildings throughout the city and participated in the fighting against the police. Witnesses claim that witnesses further away than thirty meters from the town hall building vanished before they could reach it. Following this event, the rioting stopped completely; all violence ceased once local law enforcement forces arrived on scene. The town hall building itself was heavily damaged in the fighting, suffering heavy structural damage resulting in large sections of its outer wall collapsing. The injuries sustained by local law enforcement personnel were minimal compared to arrests suffered by civilians, who were arrested for rioting; as a result all were released immediately following their arrest.</p>
