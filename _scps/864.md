<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-864</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to monitor the space around SCP-864's location and intervene in any attempts to make contact with it. Any civilian ships approaching SCP-864 must be intercepted by Foundation vessels, tested for anomalous properties, and taken out of the vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-864 is a space anomaly that manifests on the surface of the Pleiades star cluster at approximately 1.5 light years from Earth. Instances of SCP-864 appear to be a solar sail spacecraft with a large cargo hold in the bottom. The craft is roughly 200m long and has an elongated pole near its front end, which resembles an antenna. SCP-864 appears to be made out of a steel alloy, but no less material than ordinary ship hulls or other materials have been found when testing it.</p><p>SCP-864 appears to be capable of quite astonishing speeds, with records claiming that it can move faster than any human-made vehicle in existence under optimal conditions. However, SCP-864 also seems to have some anomalous properties that make it difficult to maneuver or control accurately: overstepping the bounds of its initial speed limit often results in it registering negative acceleration instead, making it difficult to control or prevent from decelerating due to friction or drag.</p><p>SCP-864 may be breached by bypassing these barriers, however; the crew members (of which there appear to be 19) wear strange equipment in their helmets and this equipment delivers small electrical shocks whenever their head comes into contact with another crew member who has not yet engaged their helmet equipment. Although all individual crewmen seem to be in implicit communication with one another and lock their helmets whenever they are within range, this does not extend to the outside of the craft: should an otherwise uninhabited object such as a tree come into direct contact with either part of SCP-864's structure for more than about 5 seconds, it will vanish rapidly without trace (the tree reappearing on the ground within 2 seconds). Further instances of four nonhumanoids (typically 2-3 meters tall) are present on the exterior; they are apparently invisible unless they are wearing a helmet equipped with similar electronics.</p><p>If a humanoid attempts to get inside SCP-864 for more than about 15 minutes and then leave, they will vanish forever (appearing as if they went much further away than the actual distance), despite having no signs of suffering from amnestic effects normally associated with time travel paradoxes. There are seven known exceptions:</p><p>Reportedly, extra crewmen have been sent at irregular intervals as replacements, usually via ships approaching SCP-864 that were carrying supplies that were necessary for maintaining the craft and its crew. These crews are also reported to disappear just like anybody else who gets into trouble up there. Regular supply vessels now carry no less than ten times more supplies per tonne delivered than was originally planned; this anomalous effect is presumed responsible for this "oversupply" phenomenon.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> The following records are presented here to explain the nature of the ship and its crew.</p><p>The above records were found on a small storage module attached to SCP-864's exterior and have been analyzed. The 11th log is written in English, while the rest are written in the language of the nonhumanoid crewmen. They appear to be the only records available among the ship's artifacts.</p><p>The following log was found on a part of the nonhumanoid ship's exterior that had been left open after being breached as a result of a crash landing; it seems to have been written by one of the nonhumanoids who were sent for repairs, who also thought that it might be useful to let his comrades know what had happened.</p><p>The crew appears to be attempting to repair their ship after yet another crash landing. They seem to be aware that something is wrong with it, but not exactly what; it could be because the ship has been crashing for such a long time now that they've lost count of how many times it happened, or maybe because there are so many crewmen and no spare parts, etc.</p><p>The following log was found in a compartment along with several books, which all seem to have been written at different points in time by members of the SCP-864 crew. The writings suggest a spacefaring culture that has been at war with itself for many centuries. Each author appears to have been killed by unknown means after writing their own account. From what can be gathered, this conflict is apparently rooted in disputes concerning cults and their practices that develop on Earth thousands of years after humans have abandoned it, while some other authors seem to believe that they are merely reporting on events that have already taken place hundreds of years ago.</p><p>It is highly suspected that these wars go back as far as ████ B.C., which is approximately 40 thousand years before human civilization reached its current state. It is not known why this ancient conflict has not become irrelevant due to the lack of any outside interference. No less than five separate conflicts between various cults seem to have occurred at different points in time; most of them seem to have been utterly devastating, and several of them purposefully ended up wiping out entire cultures entirely (for example: the Oryssi people, who are believed to have been wiped out completely).</p><p>Two cults in particular seem to be at war over an object called The Eye of Ra. It is not known what this object is or what its purpose is, but it seems to be the center of some kind of cult worship in orbit around Venus. As mentioned before, the two factions seem to have already destroyed most other cultures on Earth thousands of years ago; one group used advanced technology for destroying planets themselves and probably was responsible for the end of human civilization on Earth, while another group seems to be more interested in protecting its own planet from threats from space.</p><p>It is suspected that this interstellar conflict might turn into another devastating war if neither side learns from their mistakes and continues fighting until there is nothing left but dust and ashes. As such, it is hoped that one or both sides will start talking before any more damage can be done."]</p>
