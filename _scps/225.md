<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-225</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-225 is contained in a standard Safe object locker located in a Class F safe room. Once a month, the container is to be inspected for leakage of any liquid or solid materials that may contain biological items. A change of clothes and sanitary supplies are to be provided once per month to all personnel working inside the immediate vicinity of SCP-225. Contact lenses should not be worn anywhere near SCP-225 at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-225 is a hardcover version of Robert Karlsson's "Yes, Suckers: The Book That Changed Golf" (Golf Digest Books, May 1994).</p><p>SCP-225 can be viewed as an elaboration of the SCP Foundation mythos in that it uses elements of SCP-096 and SCP-079. The book details the efforts of Karlsson, a former professional golfer, to reinvent golf for his colleagues. Most of its pages are filled with an autobiographical account of Karlsson's golf career and the obstacles he faced between 1975 and 1993.</p><p>Whatever liquid or solid material printed on pages 438 to 945 are expelled from SCP-225's pages fairly quickly, given their size.</p><p>Test Log 225a - Attempting to view within lit interior</p><p>Subject: Three D-class personnel</p><p>Object: Generic liter bottle</p><p>Procedure: Subject is given two bottles of water and instructed to read until he feels lightheaded. After three hours and twenty minutes, subject collapses to the ground and is separated from his reading material. He has not regained consciousness since his collapse. Research staff enter the room after six hours without finding anything anomalous.</p><p>Result: Reading material successfully expelled from text at the very moment of collapse.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> D-class personnel are not to be exposed to any information in this book for the time being, pending further testing.</p><p>Test Log 225b - Viewing with no light source present</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Two D-class personnel</p><p><strong>Object:</strong> Generic liter bottle</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject is given two bottles of water and instructed to read until he feels lightheaded.
