<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-264</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A circular 10Â m radius is maintained around SCP-264 at all times. Should any individual not show symptoms of common cold or flu, the area surrounding SCP-264 may be cleared for the purposes of testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-264 is a routine web search engine result for "health insurance quotes". The recovered results consist of two advertisements from the Fort Worth company Blue Star Life Insurance, offering individual and family health insurance plans to anyone with symptoms consistent with those of the common cold or flu.</p><p>Testing has indicated that the advertisement is highly effective at preventing detection of the common cold or influenza by research subjects. For example, 98% of subjects were cured of their affliction after exposure to SCP-264's ad. Prior to exposure, subjects reported feeling unwell in spite of baseline physical exam normalcy.</p><p>There does not appear to be any direct benefit for humans in being exposed to SCP-264; successful exposure has failed to cause either the subject's eyesight to become more acute or their humanity rating to increase.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 264-1:</strong> Testing Log:</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-3464, human male, age 39; initially healthy</p><p><strong>Exposure:</strong> Immediately following the subject's final cold, they were exposed to SCP-264.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject was cured of the common cold with no observable side effects. The subject was subsequently administered the proper amount of antibiotics and is currently in good health.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> D-3464 has since been reclassified as D-Class.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-3465, human male, age 59; initially healthy</p><p><strong>Exposure:</strong> Immediately following the subject's final cold, they were exposed to SCP-264.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject was cured of the common cold with no observable side effects. The subject was subsequently administered the proper amount of antibiotics and is currently in good health.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After initial exposure to SCP-264, D-3465 exhibited signs of imminent death, but was successfully treated and remains in good health. No further tests have been approved on D-3465.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-3441, human female, age 35; originally healthy</p><p><strong>Exposure:</strong> 24 hours following symptoms of common cold/flu</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Approximately 33% of subjects exposed to SCP-264 develop symptoms consistent with influenza/cold within 48 hours; these symptoms include fever, cough, rhinorrhea and sore throat. Of those that develop these symptoms, approximately 75% die within one week from secondary complications of dehydration or pneumonia. As such, subsequent tests have been discontinued until feasible means for preemptive curing are developed.</p>
