<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-991</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-991 is to be contained in a humanoid containment cell at Site 19. The cell is to be equipped with a safe room, which will be used for testing when possible.</p><p>SCP-991's time of death is currently unknown. Should SCP-991 be found dead, cover the location with a foundation logo and wait for found personnel to arrive. Do not attempt to disturb SCP-991's corpse until a proper investigation can be conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-991 is a Caucasian male of an unknown age. SCP-991's physical condition appears to be deteriorating at a rapid rate, with the following description of its current state:</p><p>SCP-991 was sighted near Phoenix, Arizona on ██/██/██. It is believed SCP-991 is a serial killer responsible for the deaths of 17 people in the area over the course of three weeks, though no proof has been found as of yet. The victims were all found in various locations, each at different stages of decomposition. The autopsies were performed by two pathologists from ███████ County Medical Center, both of which demised from injuries sustained during the autopsy.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong></p><p>The following is an excerpt of the autopsy report for 13/14b.</p><p>After being transported to the morgue, 13/14b's skin was peeled off of its entire body, revealing a human skeleton underneath. No signs of trauma are present on the bones - however, it seems that 13/14b would not have had any limbs at all if not for the lack of flesh. The cause of death was determined to be from blunt force trauma from a blunt object. The blunt object, which is not in possession of SCP-991, was recovered from an abandoned warehouse near 35th Street and Greenway Road. Minute traces of blood were found on its surface; no DNA was retrieved.</p><p>Agent ███████'s personal log:</p><p>I've seen this before actually!*</p><p>Who plays guitar? Who's singing?**", 'Addendum:</p><p>The following is an excerpt of a letter recovered from the home of 13/14b. The date on the paper was found to be ██/██/██, though SCP-991\'s time of death is unknown.</p><p>I thought it\'d be best to write you this letter myself, since I didn\'t want to waste your time and explained the situation twice over. I know you\'re busy with work and stuff but I really need someone to help me out. I\'m doing something that nobody ever does before: I\'m leaving my body for good. In the future, no people will know where I\'ve been or what happened to me.</p><p>What makes it even more important is that there\'s no one else who can help me at this point - your original autopsy report told you everything - and I don\'t think anyone can do it as well as you did back then. You\'re well experienced in finding answers and figuring out what happened, you have a lot of resources at your disposal, and so many other things. Nobody can do it better than you, meet me here by the lake nearby from now on. Don\'t worry about telling anybody about this - try to make sure no-one finds out about me at all. It\'s just for a little while longer until we finish this task, which we\'ve been working on with no breaks for almost 3 weeks now. You saw what happened with the bodies outside; they\'re not coming back at all now, they won\'t even rot anymore.</p><p>I don\'t know if you\'ll be able to find me again once this is over, but I have complete faith in your skills - rest assured, no matter how much time goes by between when you see me again and now – or later still (if this happens), I\'ll be right there looking right at you every single time you open your eyes again. Please promise me that you\'ll make sure nobody finds out about this.*</p><p>The final letter was signed D☻M☻D☻S. The "☻" in D☻M☻D☻S may be mistaken for an ☹ symbol; however, after extensive research into handwritten documents from the 1800s\' era it has been concluded that ☿L☿U☿E☿S stands for Domenico Scevola.', "Addendum:</p><p>The following is an excerpt of the autopsy report for 18/19.</p><p>The body of 18/19 seems to be in a state of extreme decay, far worse than any other corpse so far encountered. The body was described to have been in its current state for several months. Instead of decomposing organically, 18/19's body components [REDACTED] as if it were still fresh. At this point, the cause of death was determined to be from SCP-█████. No details about SCP-█████'s origin or way of feeding were found."]</p>
