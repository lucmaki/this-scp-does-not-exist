<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-736</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-736 is kept in underground containment at the Foundation's Containment Site-77, at the center of a standard humanoid containment cell. No testing is to occur on SCP-736, as it may function differently when not under extreme duress. Under no circumstances should biological testing be performed on SCP-736.</p><p>SCP-736 is fed three times a day, and provided with an adequate amount of drinkable water. Any objects used to clean or collect bodily fluids are to be destroyed immediately upon use. Individuals attempting to communicate with SCP-736 are to be apprehended and administered Class B amnestics; failure to do so will result in an immediate change in the object's classification.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-736 is a male human cadaver of indeterminate age, covered in a layer of dermal cysts. SCP-736 exerts a gravitational force on any object placed within its vicinity—this force, though non-anomalous, is strong enough to cause minor damage to the object's structure. However, the greater the amount of matter contained in the object, and thus the greater its mass, the stronger this force becomes.</p><p>SCP-736's external anatomy is strikingly human in appearance, save for three very distinct features:</p><p>SCP-736 has shown no unusual behavior or human emotion since initial containment; however, readings taken within SCP-736 show that it has an extremely high brain capacity even when compared to other sentient species.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-736 was discovered in █████, Tennessee, during a routine Foundation containment breach. An unidentified individual entered an abandoned ██████████ house, and contacted local police officials. The individual claimed to be a nun, and requested that the police escort her to a nearby hospital. The police provided aid, and the individual was transported to a nearby hospital. When it became apparent that the individual was not in need of medical attention, Foundation agents were sent to investigate.</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-736</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent ███████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Upon initial containment, SCP-736 made no attempts to communicate with the Foundation.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> What is your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-736:</strong> Jesus.</p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> Thank you for speaking with us. We are interested in what has brought you to our facility.</p><p><strong>SCP-736:</strong> I am so lonely. I have been here for so long. They don't understand me. They're not listening! I can't take it anymore. They must hear me! They must hear my cries! Please, please hear me!</p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> Who are you talking about?</p><p><strong>SCP-736:</strong> You know who I mean! The ones who do not listen! They don't listen to the words from the Bible! They don't listen to the words of the Holy Father! They don't listen to the words of Father God! Please, please listen! Please hear me!</p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> Please calm down. Try to explain yourself. We would like to know why you've come here today.</p><p><strong>SCP-736:</strong> I want them to hear me! I don't care about myself anymore, but they must hear me! Please, please hear me!</p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> You're referring to us? Why should we listen?</p><p><strong>SCP-736:</strong> Because you are people like us! You are people just like us; you have lived your whole life just like we have lived our lives, except you live in complete darkness while we live in complete light! You think you truly understand what it means to be human, but you do not understand as much as we do! You are people just like us who have been left behind by our own kind; people who have been cast out of society while we were praised by our priests, who have been slaughtered while we were spared, and yet still you refuse to listen to me! Please understand! You must understand...we are people just like you! We are people just like everyone else…why won't you ever listen? Jesus cannot take this anymore. He has given up his life for the sake of others, but he does not deserve this pain anymore. Please understand, please just for once…he will be so disappointed in you…<Sobbing></p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> Remain calm. Try not to cry. There is nothing wrong with your situation here at Site-77. No one here will turn their backs on you. We are doing all we can to help you; however, there is nothing more we can do while we wait for more information regarding your condition in general. If these symptoms persist, or if we learn anything new about your mental state, then perhaps there will be a change in our treatment of you.</p><p><strong>SCP-736:</strong> Yes…yes…I know…I know…I feel nothing anymore; all I feel is nothingness and loneliness…but I feel that emptiness because I feel something; I feel that pain because I feel something; I feel that emptiness because I feel something…I cannot take it anymore…I cannot take this anymore…please understand…<Lying on floor sobbing></p><p><strong>(Note:</strong> A Foundation linguist has since analyzed SCP-736's speech patterns and determined that it is likely an instance of sapient neologism.)"]</p>
