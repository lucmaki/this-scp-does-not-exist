<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-925</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Standard</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-925 are held in a standard Safe-class containment locker. At least one instance of SCP-925 must be kept out of the view of the subject during tests.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-925 is a series of small, coin-sized wrapped objects made from silver. Each instance features an image of a Nintendo character on the outside, with the text “Happy Birthday”. Instances of SCP-925 were recovered from an abandoned fifth-floor apartment in ███████ ██████████, where they had been found by police who had responded to a domestic disturbance.</p><p>When taken apart before exposing the coin inside, instances of SCP-925 can each be opened up to reveal a photograph. The photographs correspond to the time the photograph was taken. At this time it is unknown how or why these correspondences exist. The photos are astonishingly well kept, with no visible damage and a number of them being unaltered by time. One instance of SCP-925 has been observed to date back several decades in age.</p><p>The subject will express annoyance, surprise or confusion when opened, while all others present will react positively. At least one instance must be removed from the subject at any given time during tests and placed in a locked box with an appropriate object. The reaction of subjects can be modified by changing the way that SCP-925 is exposed, such as opening it manually instead of opening it via the photograph and placing it in the box first. This effect is stronger for any subjects who have met or seen the individual depicted in the photograph at some point in their life; this does not affect subjects who have interacted with the individual only once. Subjects will also react more positively if they are shown pictures from their own childhood than pictures from other subjects' childhoods.</p><p>It appears that having one's birthday held commemorated in this manner has no deleterious effect on chronological age; however, subject can still claim that they are older than they are through advanced math or other methods as long as they were born after the date provided by SCP-925.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> While SCP-925 was found in the home of the subject, it is unknown how or why he was able to obtain it. The subject reported that he had been living with his elderly mother for several years and had been unable to remember her birthday. While this is plausible, it is unknown how he came to be able to use SCP-925. It is also unknown why instances of SCP-925 were left behind by the original owner.']</p>
