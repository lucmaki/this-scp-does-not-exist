<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-596</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-596 is to be kept in a reinforced cell measuring 1m x 1m x 1m. The walls and floor of this cell are to be made of obsidian, and the ceiling is to be lined with lead. The interior of SCP-596's cell must be kept dimly lit at all times. As SCP-596 requires twenty (20) watts of continuous illumination, no more than ten (10) watts are allowed to be used directly outside its cell.</p><p>Recovered instances of SCP-596-1 are kept in an airtight storage locker located inside Site-55's Containment Wing, Sector-55.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-596 is a pale, human female of average build who claims to be approximately 50 years old. The individual's hair and body age appear to be in accord with SCP-596's stated age, but it is highly unlikely that this human matches SCP-596's physical appearance at any point prior to the activity of its anomalous effect.</p><p>SCP-596 does not sleep or eat, instead remaining awake for approximately ten (10) hours a day. During this time, SCP-596 typically sits in a different location each day of the week, seemingly at random. The location varies from day to night and from month to month, but it has been observed to be associated with locations notable for political events or titles of importance (for example, the United States Capitol Building, the British Houses of Parliament, and the Imperial Palace in Tokyo). SCP-596 appears to spend this time carefully observing events taking place around it; observers report that it seems intent on memorizing notable details about these events, including specific speeches made by prominent figures and slogans written on placards carried by demonstrators. At the end of each session, SCP-596 stands up and walks away without making any further movement - although this behavior is somewhat more consistent when not under observation by eyewitnesses.</p><p>SCP-596 has demonstrated no ability to communicate verbally or otherwise following its exposure as an anomalous object. It also refuses to allow itself to be physically manipulated or moved through any means short of direct physical force devices. Although it possesses some knowledge regarding simple mathematics, its speech can become confused if subjects are discussed beyond a basic level of comprehension.</p><p>The earliest known instance of SCP-596-1 was recorded during a protest march held in Toronto on 12 November 1995 as an act of protest against Canada's decision to eliminate section 43(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). The protester present was seen wearing a badge indicating support for the CHRA which bore the text: "Don't make fun of my flag!" As SCP-596 walked past this protester at 10PM local time, it ceased walking immediately and remained still for three minutes. SCP-596 then proceeded calmly towards a nearby building where it remains at this date.</p><p>Since its initial containment, five (5) additional instances of SCP-596-1 have been recovered; all recovered instances date from between 1995 and 2001 and were created using flags used during these dates by various governmental entities around the world.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Following the events of ██-██-████, a number of reports began to be received from individuals claiming to have interacted with SCP-596.</p><p>The earliest reported interaction with SCP-596 was on 12 November 1995, as mentioned above. The individual reporting this interaction was a Canadian citizen who claimed to experience no apparent side effects from the interaction.</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-596</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ███████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This interview took place in the year 2007, following SCP-596's reclassification to Safe status.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Good afternoon, SCP-596.</p><p><strong>SCP-596:</strong> Hello, Dr. ███████.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> I'm sorry for the short notice, but I was wondering if you could answer a few questions for me?</p><p>SCP-596 nods its head in the affirmative.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> The first question is, did you know that you would be here today?</p><p><strong>SCP-596:</strong> I did not know.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> And what did you think of your surroundings when you arrived here?</p><p>SCP-596 begins to speak, gesturing towards the ground with its hand and speaking slowly in a more halting manner than before. Dr. ███████ waits patiently for the individual's response.</p><p><strong>SCP-596:</strong> I was confused by the surroundings, to be honest - it felt, odd to be here in a place where I had never been before, and I could not understand why the streets were so empty and quiet at all times of day, but then I realized that they were never empty and quiet - all the time! It was always bustling with activity! Then I noticed that there were people everywhere - people walking around, talking and working together as a community - but they were not my people or my countrymen or what have you. They were other people's people, but not mine!</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> And how did this make you feel?</p><p><strong>SCP-596:</strong> Confused, I guess. I do not understand why these other people are here - why they are allowed to be here - but if it is okay with them then it must be okay with me so I stay too! But there are so many of them! It feels like we will never get through to all of them! Why can't they be like us? Why can't they be like me? Why can't we just all be good friends?</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Thank you for your honesty, SCP-596. Are there any other comments you wish to make?</p><p>SCP-596 returns to its former calm demeanor.</p><p><strong>SCP-596:</strong> No, thank you very much, Dr. ███████. Can I go now?</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Of course, SCP-596."]</p>
