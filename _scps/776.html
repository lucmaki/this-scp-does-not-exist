<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-776</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutral</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-776 is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-77. No more than SCP-776's current amount of leeches are to be removed from SCP-776's body. Any leeches removed from SCP-776 must follow the same care plan as leeches removed from a patient suffering from Malaria, except for only using sterilized needles.</p><p>Any and all personnel who interact with SCP-776 are to wear full protective gear specifically made for handling leeches. All personnel are to be screened for Malaria prior to interacting with SCP-776.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-776 is a human male, currently aged 21. SCP-776 weighs 70kg and measures 1.8m, giving it a body mass index of 23. SCP-776 is abnormally muscular, having gained the majority of its muscle tissue from the leeches living on its body. The lack of fat on SCP-776's body gives it an extremely muscular appearance. All leeches removed from SCP-776 are approximately 2 to 5 cm in length, with the largest existing only at the tip of one of the leeches' proboscis, though all leeches show no physical changes from their time alive on SCP-776, having maintained the same shape and color as when SCP-776 was born.</p><p>SCP-774 has displayed an uninhibited and unnatural affinity for movement and physical activity. SCP-774 shows no signs of fatigue or pain when performing physical tasks such as a marathon running session or heavy squatting exercise. SCP-774 has also demonstrated high resistance to injury via blunt force trauma (such as being hit by a car while walking down a highway).</p><p>Aside from this, however, little is known about SCP-774's anomalous abilities; estimates have been made that describe over half of its anomalous traits while none have proven accurate. No brain scans of SCP-776 have been performed despite attempts made since its capture to obtain said scans.</p><p>While most other leeches feed off of blood sent by host organisms and rely upon forming difficult gas vesicles in order to feed on blood, leeches attached to SCP-772 can survive for years without blood provided they maintain their level of moisture content. This suggests that SCP-772 uses some form of anomalous energy source to survive in such a manner. Further clinical studies involving the removal of leeches from SCP-772 provide further evidence for this suggestion yet as of now there continues to be no conclusive evidence for it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>Dr. ██████████: SCP-776, I\'m going to remove the leeches from your body.</p><p><strong>SCP-776:</strong> Do I get a prize?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████████:</strong> Uh, no.</p><p><strong>SCP-776:</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████████:</strong> [removes first leech]</p><p><strong>SCP-776:</strong> [sighs in relief]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████████:</strong> [removes second leech]</p><p><strong>SCP-776:</strong> [sighs again]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████████:</strong> [removes third leech]</p><p><strong>SCP-776:</strong> [groans and says "can we skip this part?"]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████████:</strong> [removes fourth leech]</p><p><strong>SCP-776:</strong> [stops breathing and says "that\'s enough"]</p>
