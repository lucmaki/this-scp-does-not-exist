<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-739</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-739 is kept in a large storage locker at Site-19, along with a high-powered rifle and ammunition. Personnel assigned to the task of monitoring the whereabouts of SCP-739 are to be placed on regular rotation.</p><p>Should SCP-739 be observed to relocate, personnel are instructed to track its movements via satellite, and to prevent witnesses from becoming aware of the presence of SCP-739. If possible, agents are to contain SCP-739 long enough for negotiation or containment procedures to be undertaken by other Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-739 is an all-round sportsman and opponent of record, capable of handling any shooting or throwing event, as well as competing at a local level in many other sports.</p><p>SCP-739 appears to have died from a wound to the chest sustained during a hunting expedition, however subsequent testing has shown that it is impervious to injury. SCP-739 exhibits an unusually high level of physical fitness for its size and age, and has been observed to perform almost any activity with minimal effort; however, closer examination reveals that the body is composed entirely of cotton batting, including internal organs and bones. In experiments couched in terms of sport, equipment provided by the Foundation failed to damage SCP-739 whatsoever.</p><p>Although it consistently succeeds at activities on its own merit, SCP-739's competition results are disproportionately high compared to other participants. It is currently ranked number one in the United States in both rifle target shooting and skeet shooting events: two national records.</p><p>SCP-739 shares a casual acquaintance with several notable figures in American sports, including football players Peyton Manning and Joe Montana, baseball player Barry Bonds, basketball player Magic Johnson, Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn, Olympic medalists Michael Phelps and Missy Franklin.</p><p>It was formerly held by various other Foundation staff members until early 2015; since then there has been no reported sighting of SCP-739.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 739.1:</strong> Update from the Foundation</p><p>In early 2015, SCP-739 was observed to be accompanied by a team of three apparent agents. The team's movements were tracked to a site in the state of Oregon, where it was observed to be engaging in target shooting with its own rifle, apparently unaffected by the ammunition provided by the Foundation. At this time, the agents were observed to be using a large bag of marbles as ammunition, and a further investigation led to the discovery of numerous other bags of similar size in the area.</p><p>A squad was sent to seize SCP-739, but it succeeded only in causing it to flee, appearing to vanish mid-flight. A ground vehicle was used to pursue SCP-739 and eventually succeed in capturing it; however, the agents had fled prior to this point and were not located."]</p>
