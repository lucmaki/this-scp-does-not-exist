<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-556</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-556 is to be kept in a soundproof vault at Site-67. Two (2) guards are stationed outside of SCP-556's containment chamber at all times. In case of attack, the guards may use physical force to restrain the target and attempt to stop any further damage. All requests for testing must be approved by a Level 4 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-556 is a black revolver chambered for .44 magnum rounds, with a barrel of 4" long. The bullets from this gun cannot be identified by the Foundation's ballistic tech after being fired, and no material has been found on the bullets that would help identify them.</p><p>When shot at a subject, this bullet will cause severe tissue damage within the area of effect, as well as severe internal bleeding if hit anywhere other than the heart or major arteries. Should enough of this bleeding occur inside the body without a heart or major artery to stop it, then death will occur within three minutes. SCP-556 can cause death in this manner even if a limb is severed, but not if one side of the torso is severed.</p><p>When shot at an object, SCP-556 causes severe physical damage to said object. However, due to its nature, no shots have been able to pierce solid materials such as concrete or thick glass.</p><p>Testing Log 556-C</p><p>Subject: D-90113</p><p>Notes: Subject was fired upon by D-90113 via SCP-556. D-90113 had blocked half her face behind her arm when she fired. This method proved ineffective at stopping all shots sustained by D-90113, however she was unharmed except for minor abrasions to her skin when testing concluded.</p><p>Notes: Further testing involving multiple subjects is pending approval by O Command.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-556 is to be stored in a soundproof vault to prevent any further damage, and no further testing with it is to be carried out. Any requests for testing, or anything regarding this object, should be routed through the level 4 personnel of Site-67.</p><p>-O Command']</p>
