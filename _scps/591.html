<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-591</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-591 is to be kept in a sealed and guarded acid tank of 1.3 m deep, at least 10 cm thick, in Site-19. Access to SCP-591 is restricted to personnel with Level-4 security clearance. Any unauthorized attempts by individuals to enter the containment chamber are to be met with lethal force; failure to comply constitutes grounds for D-Class termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-591 is an extradimensional space, which has been designated SCP-591-2. SCP-591-2 is shaped like a Wardrobe, 5m x 1.8m x 5m, with two female humanoid entities visible inside. Due to the extremely small size of this "room," it is highly unlikely that the persons within are not perceiving the external portion directly; additionally, the entity referred to as "King Hearst" appears to be wearing a crown and holding a scepter.</p><p>SCP-591's effects manifest when any living thing attempts to enter SCP-591-2, or enters there spontaneously (currently, all testing requires prior approval by O █).</p><p>When any living thing enters SCP-591-2, it will be found in some sort of disarray. There will always be furniture and clothing scattered on the floor of the wardrobe, along with other items such as books, dishes, and knives. The most prominent of these latter items will typically be a sword or other weapon containing the symbol of Hearst Castle.</p><p>The entities inside SCP-591 will be unusually cheerful and affectionate to anyone who enters and what they are doing when their new friend exits them can vary wildly from instance to instance. It is believed that this effect is related to the image of Hearst Castle which resides inside many places associated with King Hearst, such as in his private train car after his murder or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco where he was assassinated by anarchist Leon Czolgosz.</p><p>If someone reenters SCP-591 after having exited it for more than five minutes, they will find themselves returned to whatever location they previously occupied upon exiting SCP-591.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 591-A:</strong> SCP-591 was discovered in a department store in █████████, ██████, after several residents reported a "monster" in the basement. There were no eyewitnesses, and it was ultimately determined that an intruder had stolen numerous items from the store. The only clue as to this person\'s identity was a small piece of paper bearing the message:</p><p>All hail the King.</p>
