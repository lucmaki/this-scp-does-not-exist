<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-458</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-458 is currently contained within a small chamber in Site-77's infectious diseases wing. The chamber itself measures approximately 3m x 2m, and is lined by a thick steel door, with no discernible mechanism to open or operate it. The door's outer surface is covered in microscopic oil stains, suggesting that it has been opened at least once before, with the external door being sealed afterwards.</p><p>The chamber is monitored remotely via two closed-circuit television cameras mounted in the ceiling of the containment chamber.</p><p>A live feed is also provided to research personnel at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, who are responsible for maintaining SCP-458's containment as they do with all other uncontained anomalies. All transmissions from Site-77 are routed through J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington D.C., to ensure the secrecy of the site and its inhabitants.</p><p>SCP-458's containment vault is located in the underground levels of Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, on the California coast. Access to this location is limited to Listed </p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-458 is a small, gray metallic object that measures approximately 3 meters in length and has a mass of approximately 2 kg. It possesses no visible openings, and does not respond properly to magnetic or electromagnetic fields. SCP-458 is non-anomalous within the context of nuclear physics and has undergone nuclear weapon testing with no observable deleterious effects.</p><p>SCP-458 will spontaneously generate anomalous properties when exposed to radiation from a nuclear reactor or radioactive materials. Once per day, whenever SCP-458 is exposed to this radiation, all of the following properties will become apparent:</p><p>Due to effects of SCP-458's radiation, test subjects within its vicinity will experience severe nausea, intense headaches, and other symptoms consistent with radiation poisoning.</p><p>SCP-458's nature as a radioactive material contradicts previous accounts on the subject. When first encountered by Foundation personnel, the product labelling on an industrial container of SCP-458 identified it as titanium dioxide pigment. The documented thicknesses of SCP-458 are completely inconsistent with that compound. Despite intensive research into the origins of SCP-458, no credible evidence for its anomalous properties has been uncovered.</p><p>Attempting to remove all traces of the anomalous properties from SCP-458 requires exposure to very high levels of radioactivity for extended periods of time (approximately 15 hours). No other known methods remove or stop these effects other than incineration at close proximity to a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 458-01:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-458 became self-aware after being subject to nuclear fission. Within the next two hours, the object underwent a spontaneous atomic transmutation, converting into a metallic form of uranium oxide, or "yellowcake" in the parlance of nuclear engineers. This transmutation was aided by the presence of radioactive materials. However, upon exposure to radiation again after approximately 15 hours, SCP-458 returned to its original state. Attempting to incinerate SCP-458 also failed, as it spontaneously reanimated upon reaching body temperature. No other attempts at incineration have been successful.']</p>
