<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-493</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the clandestine nature of this anomaly, no special procedures are required.</p><p>Instances of SCP-493 are kept in small waterproof boxes, locked in a small storage area located on site 44a. Foundation security personnel are to monitor all doors to the storage area at all times, and they are to be changed every 24 hours. Only a select number of personnel are allowed on site 44a at any given time, and are only to have access to non-classified documents. Any violation of this rule is to result in immediate termination and disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-493 is a collection of books, pamphlets and magazines dating from the 6th century to the present. All items have been found in Catholic cathedrals, monasteries and libraries around Europe, and have been cataloged under various titles such as La Fide Catholica, Notre-Dame de Louvain, or Il Catecumenale di Ratisbona. Each item has an identical cover, containing only a crude illustration of an object consistent with Catholic doctrine.</p><p>No two individuals have been found to possess all of the items at the same time, although it is clear that there were at least two groups of individuals involved in the creation of the items, and that one group was unaware that an antagonist sought to spread anti-Catholic propaganda.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-493 was first discovered in the year 1356 during a raid of the Monastery of St. Pierre de Gand, in the former province of Artois. During the raid, one of the agents (D-5732) had the misfortune to open a box containing SCP-493 items, and was immediately killed by an animate object that grew from SCP-493 material. The following day, several other agents were found dead in their quarters, with the same animate object.</p><p>Upon investigation, it was determined that the animate object called itself "The Reader", and claimed to be a worshipper of the "One True God". It has since been determined that The Reader is sentient and capable of speech, but only when using books found on site 44a. The following is a transcript of The Reader\'s response to interrogation.']</p>
