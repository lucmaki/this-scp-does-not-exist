<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-683</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-683 is to be held in a standard containment locker within Site 99. No personnel are to enter its chamber for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-683 refers to a United States Postal Service mailbox located at ███ ███████ in ██████████, CA. Its contents are listed as follows:</p><p>0/1 OAKLAND, CA 94610</p><p>Addresses to any other locations are found within the text of SCP-683's envelope.</p><p>SCP-683 was recovered after its current occupant was reported missing. The mailman who discovered it claimed that he had never seen SCP-683 before and denied having delivered SCP-683. Analysis of its envelope reveals that it was hand-addressed, handwritten and mailed on ██/██/██ using USPS CitySpec 2000 postal sacks. When it is opened, the message inside reads:</p><p>JUNK NOTES</p><p>For the record, you gave me your address regarding the return of my junk mail collection. I do not collect junk mail but I live in an abandoned building with a single closet and that space is already filled with it. So for now, your junk mail will remain here until I can find a more sober place for it.</p><p>It is not often one has the pleasure of meeting someone new on their first day as a resident of Site 99. You may be interested to know that I am a fan of yours, Mr. Reese ██████. You may have seen some of my work hanging around the site during your time here so far. Perhaps you have even wondered what happened to me. Look no further than this Closet where I have been living off of the last few bags of my stuff since you moved in across from me without even knowing it!</p><p>Now, although I do not believe we've met yet, I must apologize for coming over so late at night without calling or anything instead of immediately making myself known as a fellow resident of this rather remote/difficult place to get to and stay in while working several shifts a day plus PT when you can spare the time or money to do so like most people seem to be able to do these days because hey, free food and free rent are great things in life. But alas, those days are long gone nowadays and you're still eating away at your retirement fund by working seven days a week so this letter has already been way too long and I'm sure you're busy trying to finish your fifteen minute task so please come over tomorrow morning if you would like to get to know each other better outside of how many lunches one ate together on their first day as coworkers or “Hey did you see that guy?” conversations about who did what when. Anyway, once again please come over tomorrow morning for my homecoming party! Thank you for all your hard work!</p><p>Sincerely, J█████</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
