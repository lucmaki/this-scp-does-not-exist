<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-568</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-568 are to be contained in a large concrete containment chamber, measuring approximately forty meters by thirty meters. The chamber should be kept in an airtight environment during the daylight hours. No attempts are to be made at removing any instances of SCP-568; all experiments should focus on determining the amount of time required for elemental particles to pass through the space between two instances of SCP-568 and into a third instance.</p><p>Demise of any instance of SCP-568 is to be prevented by containment procedures above. Any personnel attempting to locate or remove instances of this object should be considered hostile and resisted with all available force. Civilians coming into contact with an active instance of SCP-568 should not attempt to intervene in any way; instead, they should be escorted from the area as quickly and safely as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Instances of SCP-568 are a series of sculptures, measuring approximately forty-five meters long and five meters tall by sixty meters wide. Each instance is composed almost entirely of a single metal alloy, but with significant variation in the alloy's composition and condition. All instances appear to be non-functional; their internal mechanisms were not found. The first piece was discovered in ██████, Scotland on ██/██/19██. It is believed that the first instance was created around ██ BC, most likely between the years of AD 50–200.</p><p>SCP-568 transmits an electrical current when in contact with any kind of solid subatomic particle. This current will continue to flow until the piece is moved out of direct contact with its surroundings. Thus far, this transmission has been observed through two forms:</p><p>Thus far, all attempts to discover exactly how SCP-568 transmits energy have been unsuccessful; experimentation on how it 'hears' or 'sees' has also failed to produce any results. It is possible that SCP-568 can detect some form of particle resonance within itself, although no known means of detection exists.</p><p>I heard it from my grandfather when I was a little girl. He said he used to use one back in his time, and called them "Murder Stones". They would always choose one who was at their peak - their skills at their height, their worth, what have you - and then they'd kill them, leaving behind a small pet stone for all to see.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong> On ██/██/20██, a researcher in ██████, England discovered an instance of SCP-568 within a large petting zoo. The instance was discovered in the possession of a pair of adult chimpanzees, who had apparently been carrying it for some time. The instance was quickly contained. Later that day, the site's owner was found deceased in his home, with several stab wounds. It is currently suspected that the death was caused by the chimpanzees, who were released into the wild shortly thereafter.</p>
