<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-805</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-805 is to be kept in a standard anomalous object containment locker at Site-48. No more than five (5) specimens of SCP-805 are to be kept in the same locker at any time. The manifest should state that there are only four (4) instances of SCP-805 at all times. Specimens of SCP-805 in storage should be kept in containers constructed from materials that do not react with the effects of SCP-805 (see Addendum).</p><p>In the event of an incident involving SCP-805, the affected personnel are to be administered Class A amnestics and released into public custody. In the event that further investigation is required, the affected personnel are to be given a Class B amnestics and reclassified as "missing persons". Communiqués issued by Site-48 are to emphasize the improbability of SCP-805's activation outside of its original container.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-805 is a single gold tooth of unknown origin. If a human is exposed to the presence of SCP-805, it will manifest outside of its original container as an anomalous effect that affects the person being exposed to it. The exact nature of this effect varies from case to case and has not been confirmed by experimentation.</p><p>The effects caused by SCP-805 are as follows:</p><p>SCP-805's size and mass have not been altered in any way. Despite this, attempts at forcibly altering their size or mass with non-anomalous means have shown no success as of yet.</p><p>The effects caused by SCP-805 can only be removed by placing the object back into its original container with all other instances of SCP-805 simultaneously. If the objects are all inside one instance of SCP-805, the amnestics need not be applied; however, any affected personnel who escapes the previous containment procedures are to be administered Class A amnestics and released into public custody.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> The following is a log of all known incidents involving SCP-805.</p><p><strong>Incident-085-1:</strong> During the early stages of SCP-805's containment, miscellaneous objects were found to have been affected by it. Among these objects were a promotional poster, passed out at an SCP Foundation sponsored holiday event, and a coin given to the SCP foundation headquarters staff.</p><p>The poster was found in the possession of a Level 3 researcher who had previously been investigated for accepting gifts from anomalous entities. Upon investigation, it was discovered that he had been directly exposed to SCP-805 and was suffering from a mild case of tooth decay. He was immediately granted Class A amnestics and reassigned. The coin was brought to the attention of Dr. ██████████ by his assistant, who had previously been exposed to the poster. Dr. ██████████ attempted to contact Site-48 for advice on how to remove the object from his possession, but was unable to due to the object's effect on his assistant. Despite this, Dr. ██████████ allowed the object to be taken without incident and removed from his possession."]</p>
