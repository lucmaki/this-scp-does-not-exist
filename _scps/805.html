<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-805</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-805 is to be kept in a standard anomalous object containment locker at Site-48. No more than five (5) specimens of SCP-805 are to be kept in the same locker at any time. The manifest should state that there are only four (4) instances of SCP-805 at all times. Specimens of SCP-805 in storage should be kept in containers constructed from materials that do not react with the effects of SCP-805 (see Addendum).</p><p>In the event of an incident involving SCP-805, the affected personnel are to be administered Class A amnestics and released into public custody. In the event that further investigation is required, the affected personnel are to be given a Class B amnestics and reclassified as "missing persons". Communiqués issued by Site-48 are to emphasize the improbability of SCP-805's activation outside of its original container.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-805 is a single gold tooth of unknown origin. If a human is exposed to the presence of SCP-805, it will manifest outside of its original container as an anomalous effect that affects the person being exposed to it. The exact nature of this effect varies from case to case and has not been confirmed by experimentation.</p><p>The effects caused by SCP-805 are as follows:</p><p>SCP-805's size and mass have not been altered in any way. Despite this, attempts at forcibly altering their size or mass with non-anomalous means have shown no success as of yet.</p><p>The effects caused by SCP-805 can only be removed by placing the object back into its original container with all other instances of SCP-805 simultaneously. If the objects are all inside one instance of SCP-805, the amnestics need not be applied; however, any affected personnel who escapes the previous containment procedures are to be administered Class A amnestics and released into public custody.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
