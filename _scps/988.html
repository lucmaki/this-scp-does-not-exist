<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-988</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-988-1 are to be stored in individual containment cells, each containing a sealed vacuum flask. The bottles are to be filled with water at least 30 cm above the bottom of the lid and left to soak for up to one hour before being removed from the cell. This procedure is to be repeated every time SCP-988-1 have been emptied, and the process is to be performed within fourteen (14) hours after emptying.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-988 is the collective designation for a group of forty-eight (48) anthropomorphic apples, collectively designated SCP-988-1. Each SCP-988-1 instance is capable of telepathic and telekinetic communication with any human who consumes an apple from the specific set. Once an individual has consumed a specific SCP-988-1 instance, they will perceive themselves as being in full possession of all the knowledge that comes with that object, and will be unable to remember any knowledge gained prior to consuming the first SCP-988-1.</p><p>As each instance of SCP-988 is individually stored in its own sealed vacuum flask, it is theorized that this effect exists only within the range of containment cells. However, should any SCP-988-1 instance be removed from the cell, they will immediately lose the ability to communicate with humans and become inert once returned to their respective cell.</p><p>SCP-988 was discovered following reports of odd behavior in the town of ████████ ██████, England. The Foundation's interest in the situation was piqued when a number of civilians began experiencing bouts of amnesia and loss of short term memory. All subjects were interviewed by Foundation personnel and found to be unable to recall anything prior to consuming a specific apple from SCP-988. Investigations into the circumstances surrounding these incidents led to a local farmer named ████████ ████████, who claimed to have been gifted with multiple instances of SCP-988 by a chinese man wearing a yellow robe.</p><p>In his remaining hours before death, Mr. ████████ described how he had been visited by a Chinese man calling himself "Master Wu" wearing a yellow robe, who presented him with several apples which he claimed contained all the knowledge one could ever want to know. The man told him that he was thus allowed to become a "living library", since he would collect all knowledge in his own head until he died. He then proceeded to recount his experiences with SCP-988 over the course of several days before dying from natural causes.</p>
