<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-796</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-796 is to be located in the Communications Wing of Site-██, locked in a secure locker located on site. A standard radio transmitter operable from a distance of 200 meters is to be attached outside SCP-796's containment locker. This transmitter may only be used for testing purposes and is not to emit any signals. Testing with SCP-796 should take place on site.</p><p>Should testing require equipment that needs to be transported to site, two (2) Level 4 staff members are to escort the object at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-796 is a black, plastic box measuring 35cm x 15cm x 15cm (14"x6½"x6½") with an open compartment in the front. The bottom of the case contains an aluminum support that allows the object to be hung from a hook on a wall. The box contains no electronics or circuitry. When SCP-796 emits radio waves at a frequency of 28.35 MHz, it will attempt to establish contact with an individual designated by said individual's last name. Should contact not be made, SCP-796 will retreat into its sealed compartment and attempt to establish contact again when conditions are appropriate.</p><p>Test Log:</p><p>Testing Notes: The following was conducted at Site 84 on 4/11/███, with Dr. ████ posing as subject █████.</p><p>As the test progressed, Dr. ████ reported hearing his name being mentioned several times. Due to the length of time required to complete the test, audio analysis had been completed by the time of reporting, with low-frequency ultrasonic analysis showing that the subject's first name was being spoken by the object, while his surname and last name were being spoken by Dr. ████. Analysis of voice patterns showed that there appear to be two separate speakers using identical language patterns, with one female and one male speaker. (See Audio log.)</p><p>At 21:27:22, Subject [REDACTED] entered Site 84 and began talking to [REDACTED]. As Subject [REDACTED] turned his back towards Dr. ████ to answer a call on his cell phone, he asked Dr. ████ if he could talk through SCP-796. He was prompted to place a piece of paper inside SCP-796's container for approximately thirty seconds before noticing it had already fallen out when he opened it again and asked what happened; when told that he had not "dirtied" SCP-796, he became visibly upset and returned to the communications room for discussion purposes. At this point, Dr. ████ noted odd background noise similar to a radio or television playing in the distance outside Site 84's perimeter fence; it grew stronger as both subjects spoke over SCP-796's radio transmitter until they disappeared off site at 21:30:08 and 21:30:17 respectively.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> The following was recorded in Dr. ████'s office while testing SCP-796.</p><p><strong>Subject [REDACTED]:</strong> — was a prisoner at Site 84, and had been [REDACTED] on 12/22/████. I don't think I'll ever forget the first time ██████ told me that he would be executed if I didn't help him escape and come with him to a new life. I wanted to believe it was bullshit but, I couldn't stop myself from thinking about those words over and over again. Wondering how far he'd go to get me and my family out of here.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> How long are you going to keep talking about that? This isn't helping anything.</p><p><strong>Subject [REDACTED]:</strong> Sorry, Doc, this is what keeps me awake at night. It keeps me wondering what he's doing to my family. Is he even alive or did he die in his cell? Is he living with someone else who has no idea he's been killed? Hell, is he ever even there at all?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> You're finally getting somewhere!</p><p><strong>Subject [REDACTED]:</strong> No, Doc, I can't think about any of this anymore. Just one more thing? When was the last time you saw my wife and kids?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Subject [REDACTED]:</strong> When was the last time you saw my wife and kids? When did they even leave again? We don't talk anymore because they're not here anymore. I just want to know when they left so I could tell them goodbye too.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> It's been a long time, I'm sorry; I'm sure they're fine.</p><p><strong>Subject [REDACTED]:</strong> I wouldn't know, Doc, because they aren't around anymore.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> This is pointless; we should be focusing on the present not on the past.</p><p><strong>Subject [REDACTED]:</strong> Well now what am I supposed to do? I can't even go home to comfort my family without them killing me for talking about it! They're not dead, Doc, you know that! They've abandoned me, our son hasn't spoken to me since he got here! He thinks I'm a monster for doing what I have to do to keep him alive! What kind of person does that make me?!</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Calm down or else this'll take ages! You're going to give yourself a heart attack before we're done!</p><p><strong>Subject [REDACTED]:</strong> Okay… okay… Sorry… Sorry… It's just… it's been so long since they were around. All these years of hoping and wishing, thinking that maybe they'd come back for me… But now… now they both just disappeared after 25 years of being happy with each other just like that… And now they don't even want to hear my name… Even if only for a second…</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> They'll come back again one day; you know that right?</p><p><strong>Subject [REDACTED]:</strong> Yeah, yeah… I know but… how do we know when the right time is? If they don't come back before I die or if it's still too late for them after all these years; how do we know if our time is up yet or not? What if it really is too late for us in the end? How do we know that it isn't too late for them too? God, Doc, I just want to see them again one last time before I finally die myself! Please let me see them again one last time! Please, please let me see them one last time before the end comes for us all!</p><p>At this point recording ended."]</p>
