<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-938</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-938 is to be kept in a large containment chamber in Storage Bay 5, with no less than twenty (20) security personnel present at all times. A room with a large air vent has been created for the vessel's use. SCP-938's appearance and location are to be kept from any persons outside of Foundation personnel who have been exposed to it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-938 is an abandoned vessel of unknown origin, constructed out of wood and metal. The "Black Pearl" was built in ████ after the downfall of the █████pirate fleet. It has been in storage at Site 17 since it was seized during a Foundation raid on ████.</p><p>SCP-938 weighs approximately 8,000 pounds, or 500 tonnes. Changes in its mass are consistent with movement within the space of the vessel. The ship is composed of a large central room accessible via numerous hatches on all sides, as well as two smaller rooms in front of this room and one large one behind. Each hatch has a handle which can be turned to open or close their respective door; no levers or other means of opening the hatches have been found within SCP-938.</p><p>A small group of what appears to be ghostly sailors can be observed aboard the "Black Pearl." These sailors animate themselves when they are spotted and will attempt to gather around observers who are onboard SCP-938. No attempts have been made at communication with any of these sailors by Foundation personnel and all attempts have failed as they pass through the objects internal dimensions.</p><p>The interior of SCP-938 appears to be empty, but high concentrations of smoke will occasionally emerge from openings in the walls. No source for these smokes has been determined, though high levels of sulfuric acid have been recorded at various points throughout SCP-938's interior.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 938.1:</strong> On 10/13/████, a group of researchers entered SCP-938 through the hatch on the back of the vessel. The researchers were immediately met with a large group of sailors gathering around them and attempting to enter the interior. Despite their attempts at communication with the sailors, researchers inside SCP-938 were unable to communicate with any of them. After approximately one (1) hour, researchers observed approximately fifty (50) sailors converging on their position and began to move towards the front of the ship. Researchers attempted to follow them, but found themselves unable to move through the interior of SCP-938.</p><p>The crew of SCP-938 appeared to be moving forward, but were increasing in size as they approached the front of the ship. The researchers then noticed that they had been joined by more sailors, who were rapidly increasing in size as well. Researchers attempted to leave SCP-938, but found themselves unable to do so; they eventually broke free from the ship and reported the incident to Site 17.</p>
