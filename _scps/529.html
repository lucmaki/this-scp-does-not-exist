<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-529</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A helicopter with a fully-equipped containment team (a minimum of three members, two pilots and one cover specialist) is permanently stationed at Site 17. The cover team are to be disguised as civilian maintenance technicians.</p><p>SCP-529 is currently being stored in a windowless hangar within Site 17. Containment area is to remain completely dark whenever SCP-529 is in containment, with wreaths of artificial mist created by the on-site fire suppression system installed throughout the room. The hangar itself is divided into four sections, with three doors on each side of the room. Each door has a lock capable of withstanding use from both humans and non-human entities and each door has a keypad installed with duplicate decoder keys for each door's locking mechanism.</p><p>Any personnel entering the containment area after SCP-529 was first moved there should contact Dr ██████████ immediately via phone to notify of their presence within SCP-529's containment area. Dr ██████████ should then direct them to the captive instance of SCP-529-A in order to contain it within a 6m x 6m x 6m mesh cage. Personnel entering the containment area who fail to do so within 10 minutes of contact by Dr ██████████ will be considered willingly entrapped by SCP-529 and are not recommended to emerge from the containment area afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-529 is the designation given to a cover art design created by █████ ████, a former employee of Sector-28. When studying and reading the text of various pieces of pop culture, such as The Odyssey, "Death Takes a Holiday" by Neil Gaiman and numerous stories in children's literature, SCP-529 at times will attempt to copy the titles, themes and style from the sources that it has been exposed to. It is believed that SCP-529 has learned how to alter its own image through this method of learning; however, due to its inability to alter itself in any other way as it does not possess any form of knowledge on any subject other than literature and pop culture, it cannot be determined whether or not it has more than one ability.</p><p>As SCP-529 was first captured after having copied the cover art for Alan Moore's "From Hell", its anomalous effects were only identified when it had already copied the cover art for The Odyssey.</p><p>SCP-529 is currently housed within a standard large windowless containment room (16m x 15m x 12m) equipped with:</p><p>A 6m x 6m x 6m mesh cage</p><p>The manual for an automatic dog door lock</p><p>An electric candle lantern</p><p>Twelve pairs of white cotton gloves similar to those worn by funeral workers. Three additional sets have been added in order to prevent the instances of SCP-529-A from becoming hostile toward humans while being contained within the cage.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-529 was first discovered in Foundation custody after it was chosen by the Department of Unusual Incidents Unit to be a potential candidate for the designation of a Class-D anomaly. It was placed into immediate containment after it had copied the cover art for Neil Gaiman\'s "Death Takes a Holiday". After testing had proven that the instance of SCP-529-A was not hostile, it was moved to its current containment area on ██/██/████, where it has been kept since due to its ability to copy other works of literature as well.</p><p>Including the original ████ ████ ████, there are currently 37 instances of SCP-529-A (designated SCP-529-A) within containment at Site 17, with ten instances being located in Site 17\'s main containment area and the remaining fifteen being located in Site 17\'s secondary containment area. Most of these instances have been created through a series of cloning experiments performed by Dr ██████████. SCP-529 is currently capable of producing SCP-529-A instances at a rate of one per day.</p><p>The most recent SCP-529-A instances were created after Dr ██████████ had copied the cover art for the short story "The House On The Borderland" by HP Lovecraft.</p>
