<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-529</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A helicopter with a fully-equipped containment team (a minimum of three members, two pilots and one cover specialist) is permanently stationed at Site 17. The cover team are to be disguised as civilian maintenance technicians.</p><p>SCP-529 is currently being stored in a windowless hangar within Site 17. Containment area is to remain completely dark whenever SCP-529 is in containment, with wreaths of artificial mist created by the on-site fire suppression system installed throughout the room. The hangar itself is divided into four sections, with three doors on each side of the room. Each door has a lock capable of withstanding use from both humans and non-human entities and each door has a keypad installed with duplicate decoder keys for each door's locking mechanism.</p><p>Any personnel entering the containment area after SCP-529 was first moved there should contact Dr ██████████ immediately via phone to notify of their presence within SCP-529's containment area. Dr ██████████ should then direct them to the captive instance of SCP-529-A in order to contain it within a 6m x 6m x 6m mesh cage. Personnel entering the containment area who fail to do so within 10 minutes of contact by Dr ██████████ will be considered willingly entrapped by SCP-529 and are not recommended to emerge from the containment area afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-529 is the designation given to a cover art design created by █████ ████, a former employee of Sector-28. When studying and reading the text of various pieces of pop culture, such as The Odyssey, "Death Takes a Holiday" by Neil Gaiman and numerous stories in children's literature, SCP-529 at times will attempt to copy the titles, themes and style from the sources that it has been exposed to. It is believed that SCP-529 has learned how to alter its own image through this method of learning; however, due to its inability to alter itself in any other way as it does not possess any form of knowledge on any subject other than literature and pop culture, it cannot be determined whether or not it has more than one ability.</p><p>As SCP-529 was first captured after having copied the cover art for Alan Moore's "From Hell", its anomalous effects were only identified when it had already copied the cover art for The Odyssey.</p><p>SCP-529 is currently housed within a standard large windowless containment room (16m x 15m x 12m) equipped with:</p><p>A 6m x 6m x 6m mesh cage</p><p>The manual for an automatic dog door lock</p><p>An electric candle lantern</p><p>Twelve pairs of white cotton gloves similar to those worn by funeral workers. Three additional sets have been added in order to prevent the instances of SCP-529-A from becoming hostile toward humans while being contained within the cage.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
