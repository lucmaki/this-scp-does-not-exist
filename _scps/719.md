<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-719</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Within the city of Ypsilanti, Michigan, Amatoxins Research Building and Laboratory is to be constructed. The building will be built to the specifications of Dr. Ibata. A list of requirements for SCP-719 is to be submitted to Dr. Ibata on a monthly basis. In addition, a list of approved biomass sources is to be submitted to Dr. Ibata for approval before any resource can be harvested for SCP-719's production.</p><p>SCP-719 is to be stored in a 5-m tall steel cylinder, with dimensions 1 meter long by 0.2 meters wide and two meters high. SCP-719 is not to be opened without Dr. Ibata's approval, as she must be able to verify that it contains no carnivorous animal remains or hormones left behind after it was extracted from the individual specimen's body.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-719 is a source of genetically modified proteins, which is created by converting the flesh of an animal into part of the substance. It appears to be capable of interacting with humans in a symbiotic fashion, allowing it to remain within their body after extraction. SCP-719 will begin to multiply exponentially within a human body, eventually producing enough biomass to force the subject's jawbone and bones to fracture and separate from surrounding tissue. This process is reversible through SCP-719 excision — removal of the mass of SCP-719 — or amputation.</p><p>SCP-719 was originally discovered in Ypsilanti, Michigan, when Dr. Ibata, who was engaged in her fieldwork studying carnivorous ants, learned that a cornfield behind her house had been modified with a chemical substance increasing its nutritional value. After harvesting several samples from the field, she noticed that all samples contained ovaries, testes and other glands belonging to animals. Further investigation lead her to discover that this substance, as well as similar substances found in meat and animals on farms nearby, were produced by sulfur bacteria living inside insects' bodies. The bacteria still exist (causing higher infection rates in some areas), but it has not yet been determined where they came from originally.</p><p>Dr. Ibata decided to use SCP-719 for her experiments and discovered that it would act as a powerful antifeminism agent — contained in males by removing their testes and ovaries and stored in females' bodies until fertilized eggs are ready to be pulled out. When used outside an individual specimen's body, SCP-719 has no effect on them due to its lack of intelligence; thus excision is required before it can be used.</p><p>When an individual is injured and their body suffers widespread cellular damage due to excessive cellular necrosis (reduced health/function), their natural self-repair mechanisms kick in and they attempt to regrow damaged parts of their body using any available resources (usually blood vessels). The process begins by triggering the production of male hormones at a high enough rate that they cannot be prevented from being released outside the body — however, this fails because the arteries have been blocked off by the mass of SCP-719 contained within them. Once the mass is removed from the bloodstream, spontaneous castration occurs within 5 seconds after tissue necrosis has begun and all surviving veins are severed within 10 minutes if not already done so because necrosis does not occur until after healthy tissue has been affected. Without surgical removal, an individual will slowly die of massive blood loss over approximately 2 weeks time due to salt loss from damaged cells and inability for non-blood vessels to provide nutrients necessary for survival (see Researcher Testimony).</p><p>Excision should also be performed upon pregnant females if possible; however this may prove difficult if they are unable to survive without their current source of food supply due to pregnancy hormones acting faster than male hormones. A fetus may survive incineration or live birth if separated from its mother early enough in gestation — however it must be noted that surgery performed during gestation often results in more severe cases of blood loss than those performed after delivery.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Incident 719-1</p><p>On ██/██/██, an individual was accidentally exposed to SCP-719 during an experiment. Exposure occurred when Dr. Ibata\'s assistant, Dr. ██████, reached for a sample of SCP-719 and the sample accidentally fell onto the subject\'s hand. The subject then reacted by attempting to castrate himself with various objects in his surroundings. After 12 minutes of this behavior, he was subdued and placed under heavy sedation. The subject then experienced severe blood loss as explained above; however, he did not have any severed veins and was ultimately incinerated due to his inability to survive without his source of food supply (blood).</p><p>Additionally, another instance of SCP-719 exposure occurred ██ hours after the first, when Dr. Ibata was attempting to castrate herself using SCP-719. She was discovered unconscious by security and was taken to a private hospital for treatment. Upon arrival, she reported that she had a dream where she dreamed that she was caged in a room with other specimens like herself; however, "SCP-719-1" stood outside her cage, leading her to believe that it was sentience in disguise, since no known being could be so large. The dream ended with the entity approaching her cage, apparently intending to let her out. The next morning, Dr. Ibata was found conscious and coherent and reported that she never had the dream again — only noting that it left her feeling uneasy.</p><p><strong>Note from Dr. Ibata:</strong> I am running out of options in controlling SCP-719\'s production while maintaining its ability to be excised safely; therefore I am asking you to begin construction on my facility ASAP.']</p>
