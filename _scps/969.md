<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-969</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-969 is contained in a reinforced concrete structure located in the middle of Site-██. SCP-969's containment area has been constructed to contain a single instance of SCP-969 at any given time, and the only access to it is through the main entrance of Site-██.</p><p>As such, no personnel with Level 2 clearance or above are allowed within a two kilometre radius of SCP-969's primary containment area without permission from at least one member of the lead staff team. Any personnel attempting to enter this area without permission will be detained by members of the lead staff team for further investigation, as well as being interviewed regarding their motivation for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-969 is an adult male human corpse with a height of 1.95 metres and a mass of 76 kilograms, with no external wounds other than those caused by the injuries it sustained during its death. It is dressed in a suit of clothes identical to a standard civilian's, though the suit has been extensively altered to conceal the corpse's skeletal structure. The body is approximately 20 years old at the time of examination, though as a result of its unusual composition it will be unaffected by aging or any known diseases.</p><p>SCP-969's anomalous properties come into effect only when there is at least one living human being within a 2km radius of the entity. If this condition is met, SCP-969 will arise from the ground on its own accord and proceed to follow whoever was last seen within range of its movement; this entity will remain within range indefinitely until either the subject dies or SCP-969 itself expires.</p><p>While following the subject, SCP-969 will display aggressive behaviour towards others, including but not limited to emitting a high-pitched squeal and performing several acrobatic poses before fleeing once the subject reaches the maximum distance possible for them to move at that time. SCP-969 has never shown any indication that it is aware of its anomalous properties, and possesses no means of leaving Site-██ while following targets.</p><p>SCP-969 was discovered in ██████, UK on ██/██/20██, when reports of a "ghost" haunting ███████ High School reached Foundation attention after multiple students claimed to have seen it carrying out various tasks around campus between classes. Upon arrival, SCP-969 was discovered near ██████ High School's main entrance where it was first sighted.</p><p>The original coroner report identifying SCP-969 as an "unidentified male" was found in [DATA EXPUNGED] prior to its containment; however, an autopsy performed on SCP-969 revealed that it did not contain any internal organs whatsoever.</p><p>During initial containment procedures, SCP-969 exhibited behaviour consistent with a common case of prolonged confusion regarding what had happened to it after death. After several weeks in containment however, SCP-969 began exhibiting more violent behaviour, including pushing numerous staff members away from him in an attempt to reach the doors into Site-██'s interior and attempting to open them repeatedly using his bare hands; these attempts were always thwarted by the presence of personnel within range.</p>
