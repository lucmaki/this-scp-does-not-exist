<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-60</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-60 is to be contained at a Foundation safe house in ████████, California. The safe house is to be guarded by one Level 4 security personnel. While SCP-60 is contained, no personnel are allowed to enter the property unless authorized to do so by Site administration. The only individuals permitted access to the property without permission include Site administrators, research personnel and SCP-60 itself.</p><p>SCP-60 is not permitted any outside contact other than with Foundation personnel. No attempts are to be made to terminate SCP-60's containment or mislead SCP-60 into believing it has escaped containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-60 is an extraterrestrial entity which claims it is from the planet ██-██. SCP-60 refers to itself as 'Ongel', or the 'Overwalker'.</p><p>SCP-60 possesses human intelligence, with a very high level of fluency in English. Subject has expressed the ability to speak many languages, but only English and ██-██ have been recorded.</p><p>SCP-60 has no physical form, remaining ethereal both inside and outside of containment.</p><p>SCP-60 is able to manifest its spirit body in common locations on Earth through unknown means. This manifestation process is not instantaneous and can be prevented by hindering the subject's access to any location wishing to host it within its scope.</p><p>Once a specific site has been sealed from SCP-60's environment, it will attempt to escape containment by attempting to physically enter said location. If allowed, SCP-60 will usually remain at the site for about two weeks before fading away until another attempt is made to imprison it. It is currently believed that once SCP-60 has exited a given site, it will not return until forced out.</p><p>SCP-60 is hostile and dangerous toward all agents of humanity, as well as any other life forms on Earth without exception. It has also been recorded as threatening harm against [REDACTED] if these threats are ignored by the Foundation.</p><p>Attempts have been made to communicate with SCP-60 through both written text and audio; however, this procedure has proved unsuccessful since SCP-60 cannot read nor hear these methods of communication.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-60 was discovered by Foundation personnel after a violent break-in at the home of Dr. █████ in ██████, ██. █████ had left his home at 2:30AM on the night of ██-██-████ and was found to have sustained severe injuries when discovered three days later.</p><p>Following this event, Foundation agents are to be alerted if a [DATA EXPUNGED] event is to occur in order to prevent the release of SCP-60.']</p>
