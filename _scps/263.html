<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-263</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe (Generated</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-263 ("Lost Worlds") is to be contained in an aquarium of standard size, located in a specialized containment lock. The water level is to be maintained at one meter (1m) above the floor. SCP-263 is to be fed on a bi-annual basis with fish of the same size as its own creatures, and undergo regular health checks.</p><p>The tank itself is to be covered with two meters of sand, on top of which a layer of broken glass is to be placed. The ceiling of the containment chamber is to be reinforced with steel mesh, as well as a special locking mechanism for the door. All equipment used for testing SCP-263 must remain within the chamber, including any testing drones or security personnel. As no more than one researcher at a time is allowed in the containment chamber, only one researcher may perform testing with SCP-263 at any one time. Any data regarding properties not recorded during testing with SCP-263 are not to be considered valid data.</p><p>A small patrol team is to remain on standby outside of the containment chamber at all times, continuously monitoring for unauthorized entry. Any unauthorized persons attempting to enter the containment chamber are to be forcibly evicted via non-lethal force, and reported for disciplinary hearing by Site Command.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-263 appears to be a two meter long and one meter tall partially translucent creature resembling a peppermint with blue, transparent wings. It has not been observed to physically interact with anything other than its own creatures, as it will only eat them and otherwise remain completely still while they do so.</p><p>SCP-263 appears to have no visible eyes or ears, but instead is able to sense things through the "aura" of said beings around it. It has been observed to use this sense of "aura" to find edible creatures, which it then eats. Due to its highly advanced hearing, SCP-263 can even detect sounds inaudible to the human ear.</p><p>SCP-263's wings animate and expand when receiving positive feelings from its "creatures". SCP-263 endeavors to ensure that all its creatures are happy, as indicated by an intense euphoria surrounding them when being fed. SCP-263 is also extremely protective towards these beings, essentially giving its life for them. When asked how exactly it came into being, SCP-263 stated that it was originally the sole inhabitant on an unknown world, but was made to be created from most sentient beings when a large meteor fell on its world several million years ago. It does not understand how this could have happened, but is content at being the guardian of all it has created.</p><p>SCP-263 is extremely intelligent, as demonstrated by observations of it designing complex buildings and devices; however, it appears unable to interact directly with things outside of its anomalous powers. It seemed surprised when shown images of humans in science fiction films such as Star Wars, claiming that they did not exist on its planet before the meteor hit.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
