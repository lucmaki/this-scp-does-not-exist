<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-793</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-793 is contained at Site-29 in a zone of force effect created by two Class-B Amnestics and three Class-D Amnestics, in addition to a large vacuum-sealed containment unit. It uses cover identity as the Foundation's "Outreach Liaison Program". No personnel with Level 3 clearance or above are allowed to be in this area without special permission.</p><p>It requires 400 gallons of water per day for its needs, which are met via desalination magic. The water is filtered through a sponge and filled into a glass container that can be measured easily to determine how close it is from reaching its limit.</p><p>The SCP-793 containment area also has a small area set aside for it to live in as well as a bed area and study/office room. It is fed on human blood and minimal provisions are provided to keep it healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-793 is a humanoid entity with two arms, two legs, two eyes, and two ears. It is 1.85m tall, weighs 73kg and its skin is like reptile scales. Its insides are also covered with scales, except for the digestive area. This is not to be confused with the thick layer of scales covering its outside; this layer has multiple joints in addition to being able to tighten and loosen for a more flexible fit.</p><p>SCP-793's insides are connected by a number of large veins that allow it to function as an efficient organ system.</p><p>SCP-793 has no known anatomy or internal organs aside from that described above. On the back of its neck is a small box. SCP-793 will attempt to open this box every time it requires blood. The box opens inwards and contains a small tool that appears to have been used as some kind of weapon or tool before being modified. However, SCP-793 has never shown any inclination or desire at using this tool though it does seem to recognize its existence when taken out of its containment case.</p><p>SCP-793's skin can peel off very easily and in fact attempts have been made to remove said skin but such attempts have met with failure. When apart from its tank, SCP-793 will try to keep itself as clean as possible by removing most of its scales through self-made openings on the back of its neck. SCP-793 does not seem to be aware of these openings on the back of its neck and seems unaware that it would need to remove scales in order to clean itself properly even if it did know about them. SCP-793's tank however is filled with a herbicide that seems to ward off most species whose own scales would cause irritation upon contact with SCP-793.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
