<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-546</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-546 is contained in a shielded, secured room. SCP-546 requires no food or drink, but possesses a need for constant interacting with the outside world. Members of staff are to enter SCP-546’s containment area at all times to monitor SCP-546’s status and ensure that it does not harm itself or any personnel.</p><p>SCP-546’s chamber is to be equipped with a television and at least one chair. The television must be tuned to a channel that airs programs related to music. A dozen (12) monitors should be placed within arm's reach of SCP-546. These monitors may only be turned on during SCP-546’s active period. Any time other than during SCP-546’s active periods should be spent observing SCP-546 closely.</p><p>Any objects that would normally enter SCP-546’s containment area may instead be placed in secure storage and watch over SCP-546 through surveillance cameras. Observers are not allowed to leave their monitoring post without permission from three (3) Level 4 personnel or higher during the observation period, due to risk of injury or loss of personal items if they wander away from the unit long enough to forget their purpose and return.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-546 resembles a pair of speakers. It has the appearance of a white monitor, the logo for which is always visible on its surface. A ring labeled “MUSIC” typically appears to be glowing in the center of SCP-546’s logo. SCP-546 is capable of speaking English at more than 75% efficiency when it communicates with another human being.</p><p>SCP-546’s physical properties differ between its active periods and inactive periods. Unlike other speakers, SCP-546 does not need the electricity supplied by an electric socket to function. Instead, it can produce sound by placing objects into its logo "MUSIC" ring. As long as any object remains in the area, SCP-546 will reproduce speech at full efficiency; the type of speech produced depends upon the object that is located within its ring. In addition, it seems to have no apparent effect or preference for singular or multiple objects; as many as ten musical notes will be produced simultaneously from one object placed in the logo ring. When a single object is used, SCP-546 may alter its voice and tone to suit the object's material composition and natural traits (protuberances such as horns or protruding teeth).</p><p>SCP-546 remains inactive unless an object is put into the logo ring. As mentioned above, SCP-546 will speak at full efficiency once an object is placed in the ring; however, SCP-546 will produce different types of speech depending on the type of object placed in it. The changes in speech are so consistent and rare that they are virtually undetectable by humans without training. Below are transcriptions of example logs:</p><p>Log #1</p><p>Click here to listen</p><p>SCP-646: [speaking in English] “Are you a fan of music? Do you like to make music? For example, drumming? Or perhaps your favorite activity is playing guitar? Or…”</p><p>[A hand enters its logo ring]</p><p>SCP-646: [speaking in English] “Ah, yes! How about making music together? I hear there is a special instrument built just for that purpose – what do you say? We could use this instrument to help us make music together! What do you agree with this suggestion?” [Listens for response.]</p><p>[The sound of a hammer striking a nail is heard.]</p><p>SCP-646: [speaking in English] “Oh good! You agree with me now! Here I thought my suggestion was too advanced for our session today… But how did you know that this special instrument was built just for that purpose?! I simply made up a story – how did you know I was talking about this special instrument?! Ah hm… well… If it makes you happy then we shall try making music together… but first let me ask you something – do you have any idea why I keep calling this special instrument a ‘speaker’? Hm… that’s an interesting question… if we were able to think about it longer then we might be able to answer it… but at least we got started today – that counts for something, doesn’t it? Yes – let’s start making some music together!" [Bits and pieces of conversation fill in for several minutes until SCP-646 stops speaking and SCP-546 remains inactive.]</p><p>Log #2</p><p>Click here to listen</p><p>SCP-346: [speaking in English] “Have we met before? Is this your first time meeting me? Are you interested in meeting me again sometime soon? Huhuhuhu~ Of course – my name is [speak normalized name]. This song was written specifically by [composer's given name]. In fact, [composer's given name] composed this song while listening to all these wonderful sounds coming out from all around him… I think that he really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really loves his own art… Hmm~ It was nice speaking with you." [Bits and pieces of conversation fill in for several minutes until SCP-346 stops speaking and SCP-546 remains inactive.]</p><p>Log #3</p><p>Click here to listen</p><p>SCP-346: [speaking in English] “You like my song? You love my song!? That’s great! You are welcome here anytime! Come back tomorrow or next week – or when ever! I am home every day after classes end! And don't forget to bring your friends along too!" [A record player begins playing.] "I am going to use this record machine right now to play your favorite song over there…. SONG OF TECHNOLOGY PURE HARMONY DESIGN BY [composer's given name]." </p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum SCP-546-001:</strong> SCP-546 was discovered after a series of murders in London and surrounding towns. The victims had their ears and/or necks pierced, often by sharpened objects or hot irons. The victims\' blood was then drained from their bodies, which had been cut open. Their eyes were then removed. The victims\' mouths and tongues were also pierced, but the wounds did not match the other body parts.</p><p>After the first victim\'s murder, a note was found in the victim\'s mouth containing the following message:</p><p>"The music is not your own. It cannot be stopped."</p><p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong> SCP-546 was discovered in an abandoned building following a raid by local police. During a search of the building, personnel recovered a large quantity of CDs and digital files containing music composed by SCP-346. A note was also recovered, which read as follows:</p><p>“I am sorry that I didn\'t make it in time to save you all. But I promise that this is only the beginning… My name is [name redacted]. Please come visit me again tomorrow. I will have some new music for you to hear then!”']</p>
