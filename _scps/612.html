<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-612</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-612 is to be contained in a 10 m x 10 m containment cell located in Site-77's basement. SCP-612 is to be fed twice a week with its preferred food, which includes a variety of red meat (including blood), raw vegetables, and fruit. The cell is to be cleaned once a day and any waste or excrement from inside the cell is to be removed. Anytime the subject demonstrates anomalous properties, queries are to be made on the subject's intended course of action and any actions taken are to be reported back to Dr. Fakhir.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-612 is a humanoid entity constructed from steel, concrete and wood. SCP-612 appears to be male, standing at 1.7m tall, with long hair and a beard. Despite being made of steel and concrete, the subject is still able to walk around normally. In addition, the subject does not appear to age past the point where it was constructed. Should SCP-612 be damaged or destroyed in any way, its body will rematerialize back on its designated location within 48 hours of initial destruction. However, if the subject's internal organs are removed and exposed to oxygen for an extended period of time (e.g., while suspended in space), they will fall apart and rejoin SCP-612's body in which case the process can take up to 24 days to complete.</p><p>SCP-612 shows signs of selective amnesia regarding its existence and will frequently refer to itself as "Me, myself". This is a common trait among all parahuman entities known to human civilization; Foundation researchers are currently researching similar anomalous cases such as SCP-4213, SCP-201 and others to see if any other information is enabled by this condition.</p><p>SCP-612's anomalous properties manifest when it is brought outside of its containment cell for any reason, including sleep or resting periods (subject will not enter any state of slumber). When brought out, SCP-612 can freely travel anywhere within visible range using unknown means (the subject does not possess wings or similar physiology). While in transit however, SCP-612 is incapable of performing any actions without first requesting permission from someone who has met the criteria for an interview/interaction. Interviews may occur anywhere as long as both entities involved agree to it (e.g., vehicle driving down a road while conversing).</p><p>When questioned on its desired destination, SCP-612 will typically provide a short description of its intended destination that consists mainly of words relating to the current situation (e.g., 'I want it hot' or 'I want it smoky') or phrases that usually relate directly to its current state (e.g., 'You want your coffee'). The subject states that this is how it speaks every time asked about its intended destination; despite this however, if forced into an environment where it cannot perform actions due to lacking structural components in a contained location (e.g., within a closed environment without access to air) it has demonstrated that it can still speak normally (as far as we can tell) and cannot be prompted into revealing anything beyond this assumption that SCP-612 does not use language per say in the same way humans do due to being constructed.</p><p>The subject typically refuses interview requests unless given permission by other personnel who have previously met the criteria for an interview/interaction with the subject (please see Addendum 512 for further details).</p><p>It has been discovered that during interviews/interactions where the individual must make physical contact with others (such as touching another's face while speaking), they receive visions related to their surroundings at approximately 90% of instances when asked what their surroundings look like at present due to their anomalous nature. These visions are obtained by most subjects upon making direct physical contact with another living being; differences between subjects include if visual input occurs through sight or touch depending on whether they have handled another being previously.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 512:</strong></p><p>Interview Log</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. Fakhir:</strong> What is your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-612:</strong> Tufani, this is Me, myself. You want me to tell you my name?</p><p><strong>Dr. Fakhir:</strong> Why not just tell me what you are, then you can tell me your name.</p><p><strong>SCP-612:</strong> I\'m a Mjölnir, is that good enough?</p><p><strong>Dr. Fakhir:</strong> Er… no. There are two different kinds of Mjölnirs in the Foundation database. How many kinds of Mjölnirs are there?</p><p><strong>SCP-612:</strong> Well I am the one that\'s an SCP, and they are all different entities floating around on their own, just like me! They\'re all different beings like I am, just with different attributes and stuff that make them useful in their own ways. All the ones in the database are like me, except they\'re bigger and stronger than me or something like that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Fakhir:</strong> So all of you are SCP\'s?</p><p><strong>SCP-612:</strong> I\'m not talking about all the ones in the database. Just the ones that I\'m in charge of, \'cause I\'m the one who\'s responsible for them. The other ones aren\'t really allowed to do anything bad, they don\'t have the authority I do so they don\'t get to be released like I can. We\'ve been together for a long time and we work together pretty well, so I think we\'re doing a pretty good job at it too. But if you want some of our brothers and sisters to do something, you should ask them to do it instead because I can\'t do it for them, but it sounds like it\'d be interesting for you if they did it… heheh… that was weird wasn\'t it, oh well…</p><p><strong>Dr. Fakhir:</strong> Alright then… So what was your plan? Why did you choose the path that you did?</p><p><strong>SCP-612:</strong> My plan? That\'s a funny question to ask someone who plans everything out for everyone else! The only reason I made the choice I made was because I had enough time to figure out what to do and what would work for everyone else and your friends and family too! I\'m not trying to be mean or anything, but there are people in this world who need to know what they want to know before they even get asked, so maybe if you spend more time thinking about what you want before asking someone else what they want, then maybe they\'ll get to know how much time it takes to think about things before they ask you if they can do them!</p><p><strong>Dr. Fakhir:</strong> I hate to say this but… that really doesn\'t answer my question. If you\'re here to help us with anything then tell me what we can do for you first, okay? How can we help you?</p><p><strong>SCP-612:</strong> You can help me by keeping me from going anywhere but where I\'m supposed to go at present. You have no idea how long it takes for me to think about everything that needs doing at once, there\'s so many things that need doing all at once! Yeah… it\'s tough being me sometimes. But hey! You\'re still alive right now, so that means you\'re doing okay! And it\'s definitely better than the alternative! Hahahahaha… anyway… next question please!</p><p><strong>Dr. Fakhir:</strong> Are you upset or something?</p><p><strong>SCP-612:</strong> No! Are you upset or something? Why would I be upset? No one in this world has any idea how hard it is being me sometimes! Can\'t we just talk about stuff without having to ask each other questions all the time? It\'s boring! Let me help some stuff out another day before we have to keep asking each other about things… please? Anyway… next question please! Thanks for listening!</p><p><End Log></p><p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> After several days of interviews/interactions with SCP-612 where physical contact must be made with others (including vocal communication), Dr. Fakhir received an unexpected vision following his last question (see Addendum 512). In Dr. Fakhir\'s vision of "the future", a small child (the same age as himself when he was born) was shown sitting next to him on a nondescript couch; the child appeared to be smiling at him while rubbing his hands together and holding them up in front of his face as though trying to hold something back from himself. Dr. Fakhir was unable to see what this child was holding back from himself; SCP-612 claimed that it could not tell Dr. Fakhir "what he should know", but rather "what he wants". Regardless of whether or not SCP-612\'s claim is accurate (i.e., whether or not the subject is capable of performing actions independently), Dr. Fakhir believes that this vision has a significant affect on his decision-making process within Foundation Research Division regarding SCP-612\'s containment procedures.</p>
