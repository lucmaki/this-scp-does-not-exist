<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-441</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-441 is to be kept in a standard containment cell equipped with a cot, refrigerator, and incense. SCP-441 may be permitted to attend sessions at Containment Site-██, but it is forbidden to speak or interact with any personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-441 is a humanoid composed of grass with two large horns protruding from its head. SCP-441's physiology is typical for its kind. It is able to move at speeds of up to 200 km/h and has expressed interest in cooperating with researchers in testing new transportation methods.</p><p>When not under the influence of hallucinogenic agents, SCP-441 expresses extreme hatred for humans, perceiving them as savages who have desecrated its rightful home by feeding it to cows.</p><p>Humans appear to be the only sentient beings that SCP-441 has deemed non-hostile; it will attack any other creature with little provocation. Evidence suggests that SCP-441 is capable of coherent speech and is able to form simple sentences. It will only speak when under the influence of hallucinogens or when spoken to by a human, however it has demonstrated an ability to understand basic spoken language in response to questions.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-441 was recovered in 2009 when a farmer noticed his cow licking the ground for several days in a row. The farmer brought the cow to a local veterinarian and reported the behavior, who contacted Foundation agents in ████.</p><p>The farmer was administered Class-B amnestics and the case was officially secured.']</p>
