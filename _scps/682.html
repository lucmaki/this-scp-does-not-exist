<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-682</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-682 is to be kept in a padded cell made of transparent polyvinyl covering, lined with memory foam. The interior of the cell is no larger than that of a standard office desk; access to the object requires the subject to climb inside through the top and step out from the bottom. Due to its size and weight, it is advised that all personnel under 21 years of age (excluding Foundation personnel) wear certified thigh braces during usage. Any substance may be introduced into the cell to reduce weight; however, it is currently unknown whether this will lower the overall strength rating of SCP-682.</p><p>A standard pair of steel handcuffs are kept on a magnetic clip attached to the wall, to prevent SCP-682 from escaping when it begins to manifest.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-682 is an imitation pop-up book of 19.5 cm (7 in) x 21.5 cm (8 in) with a translucent blue cover. When opened and closed, the pages will move, pushing against each other but remaining fixed in place. When opened to any real page or multiple pages per turn, SCP-682 creates a sound similar to that of a dry eraser rubbing against paper before pulling itself away from the edge into its dormant state. Opening SCP-682 to a blank page produces no measurable reaction.</p><p>When SCP-682 is opened to a given page and then carefully touched, the text on that page will appear as if it were in normal light and readable by human beings. This effect appears to be permanent; opening SCP-682 multiple times on the same page with no subsequent changes has not occurred in testing.</p><p>SCP-682's anomalous effect was discovered when two teenage boys were found to have spontaneously died due to an apparent cardiac arrest after opening SCP-682 simultaneously; both subjects had previously been reported as "healthy". After autopsy showed no bodily damage inconsistent with sudden death, Foundation agents embedded within the local medical community arranged for research facility supplies of SCP-682 to be provided in order to identify its properties.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Since acquisition of SCP-682, no deaths have occurred as a result of its use. Investigation into the cause of these deaths is ongoing.']</p>
