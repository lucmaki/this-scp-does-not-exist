<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-932</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-932 is to be kept in a standard Safe class containment locker. Contained objects are to be periodically assessed for SCP-932's presence, and removed from the facility if so.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-932 is a bamboo cane, 15 cm in length, with a small carving of a human hand on the other end. When SCP-932 is subjected to direct sunlight (the maximum range is 500 meters), it will begin mimicking the actions of the hand depicted on the other end. Any living thing that touches SCP-932 while exposed to sunlight will begin walking in the direction indicated by SCP-932's movements. The duration of simulation varies between subjects, but has been tested up to eight hours in one subject.</p><p>If SCP-932 is held, the subject will begin mimicking the hand's actions without direct sunlight. However, this effect is not as strong as when SCP-932 moves during daylight hours. The subject can be ejected from SCP-932 by force from outside observers.</p><p>SCP-932 was recovered from █████, ██ following complaints from residents over irregularity of local wildlife. Investigation has shown that all nonhuman animals affected by SCP-932 are Asian Elephants (Elephas maximus) and members of their species. No domestic elephants have been affected.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 932-1:</strong> Following the recovery of SCP-932, the local police detained a group of Asian elephants. Their actions were recorded on video by Mobile Task Force Psi-7 ("The Odd Squad").</p><p>Recovered footage indicates that the elephants had been attacking and killing local residents, with their actions mimicking those of SCP-932. The only difference is that the elephants would stop in place after mimicking the actions of SCP-932. In addition, it was found out that the elephants would occasionally emit a high-pitched scream when mimicking the hand\'s actions.</p><p>Following the incident, Mobile Task Force Psi-7 was sent to capture the elephants, during which one of them began running through downtown █████. It was later found out that the elephants had been transported by Foundation personnel.']</p>
