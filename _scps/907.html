<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-907</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-907 is to be monitored and reported to Foundation personnel by satellite as soon as it is sighted.</p><p>SCP-907 is currently contained in a secure, remote location in the Southeastern Pacific Ocean. No non-Foundation personnel are permitted on or near SCP-907. SCP-907 is to remain at least 1 km away from any humans at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-907 is a three-leg, venomous, and predatory species of cone snail (Conus magus) measuring between 1.3 and 3 m in length. SCP-907 lacks eyes or ears, but has a well-developed sense of smell and sonar.</p><p>SCP-907 usually lives at depths greater than 1 km and feeds on tentacle fish (Chironomidae). It possesses two defensive spines that it can use to defend itself, and its venom suppresses the central nervous system of prey.</p><p>SCP-907 will swim towards the surface of the ocean, where it appears to fade away until it disappears entirely. For this reason, SCP-907 is not generally believed to be alive, but rather an illusion or hallucination from which no physical form emerges at the surface.</p><p>If any human attempts to approach SCP-907 for more than 30 minutes, it will attack by ejecting a cloud of venomous mucus through its tentacles. The venom is not fatal unless inhaled; however, it can cause severe pain and inflammation with prolonged exposure.</p><p>SCP-907 was first detected on February 1st, 1996 when a shipping vessel reported seeing a diffuse object drifting in the Pacific Ocean, located roughly 1.3 km off the coast of Hawaii. Investigation by Foundation personnel revealed that SCP-907 was slowly rising from the sea floor at a depth of approximately 1.8 km, apparently unaffected by depth and diverting currents as if propelled by natural forces.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 907-1:</strong> On January 20th, 2000, a Foundation survey team was dispatched to investigate SCP-907. Upon reaching the surface of SCP-907, a Foundation researcher was attacked by an unknown entity and transported to another location on SCP-907. The researcher's body was not recovered and the cause of death is currently under investigation."]</p>
