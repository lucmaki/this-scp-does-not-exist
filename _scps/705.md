<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-705</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-705 must be kept in a minimum 10 cm x 25 cm containment chamber lined with lead. SCP-705 is to be kept under the constant supervision of two (2) level 3 staff members. No personnel are to handle SCP-705 without protective gloves and safety goggles. Should the order to activate SCP-705 be given, at least one (1) D-Class personnel within the perimeter of the chamber must be restrained by a safety harness and not allowed to approach or get near SCP-705 until it has been shut off.</p><p>Any bed sheets, towels, or pillows brought into SCP-705’s containment chamber must be lifted or torn before they reach it. Any items that have been deliberately torn into pieces or fluffed up must not be placed under SCP-705 in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-705 is a standard green and white plastic septic tank located in Site-██’s janitorial facilities. When not actively being watched, SCP-705 will sit dormant for roughly twenty (20) minutes before suddenly changing its shape. All of the following have been observed:</p><p>When SCP-705 has finished altering its shape, it will return to its normal state, at which point it will come under active observation from one (1) level 3 staff member. Should this staff member be lost or killed, SCP-705 will remain dormant for roughly fifteen (15) minutes until another level 3 staff member assumes their position.</p><p>SCP-705 does not appear to be affected in any way by heat or cold, and appears to be made entirely out of water. However, once inside of SCP-705, subjects are unable to breathe or contact any outside world. A number of theories exist as to how such an effect could be realized through physical means; however, they all seem to lead back to SCP-705’s anomalous nature. This also leads back to why SCP-705 was discovered in the first place.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-705 was discovered in a janitorial facility in ██████████, California. A cleaning crew had placed SCP-705 into the facility’s industrial washer and then proceeded to clean it. Upon completion of the cleaning process, SCP-705 began to emanate a low-level heat. All members of the cleaning crew were affected by SCP-705’s anomalous properties, but were able to survive the ordeal with minor injuries.</p><p>When the cleaning crew was questioned regarding how SCP-705 had been accidentally produced, they expressed confusion at having had no knowledge of an identical septic tank in their facility. An investigation into the origin of SCP-705 was initiated. The search resulted in the discovery of four (4) body bags lined up side by side in a storage locker.</p><p>The bodies were exhumed and contained within standard refrigeration units for one month. Autopsies were performed on all four bodies and have shown that each of them was missing at least one organ; however, no other abnormality has been found in any of them.']</p>
