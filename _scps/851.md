<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-851</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-851 is located in a standard high-security storage area containing lighter flammable liquids. The exterior of SCP-851's container has been painted with a substance that prevents it from igniting on its own or when applied heat or pressure is applied to the surface. Any personnel suspected of having caused any damage to SCP-851's container are to be administered amnestics, with all personnel involved in the incident being temporarily withheld for questioning.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-851 is a white, plastic bucket with a black spray paint logo on the side. A small hole in the bottom of SCP-851 leads to a secondary chamber containing a second instance of SCP-851 (designated SCP-851-2) and its contents.</p><p>When something is placed into SCP-851 and the valve is turned on, it creates incendiary foam that liquefies on contact with air. This foam takes 75 seconds to evaporate completely, leaving a residue that contains traces of any liquids that were present in said objects when they were loaded into SCP-851. The residues have been compared with human blood, resulting in some of the most accurate descriptions of their actual appearance.</p><p>After having been emptied of all liquid, both instances of SCP-851 will begin creating an effect that they would be very effective at performing if the effect was not already common knowledge among members of Foundation personnel. Attempting to use either instance as originally intended will result in spontaneous combustion within two seconds; attempting to use one instance without the other results in detonation after two seconds.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-851 was initially discovered after a series of arson attacks took place at the offices of a local boxing club. The club had been rented out by the Foundation, and security cameras revealed the culprits to be two employees of the local branch of Foundation Site-19. The two were apprehended and interrogated regarding their involvement with the arson. They were found to have been using a second instance of SCP-851 to carry out the acts. All members of staff at Site-19 were interviewed and reassigned pending confirmation that they are no longer affiliated with the Foundation.</p><p>The two arsonists were identified as an employee by the name of ████ ████ and a junior technician by the name of █████ █████████. Both had been attempting to sell SCP-851 when the time came for them to be terminated; both instances were destroyed in their attempt to evade agents of the Foundation.</p><p>After questioning, ████ ████ confessed to being hired by Dr. █████ ██████, a member of the Ethics Committee, shortly after his transfer from Site-13. Dr. ██████ was terminated from his position as an associate professor at ███████████ University shortly after his arrest.']</p>
