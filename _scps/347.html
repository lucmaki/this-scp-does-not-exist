<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-347</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-347 is to be contained in Research Area 42, to be monitored by security cameras. When SCP-347 begins to attack personnel and property, it is to be destroyed using the procedures outlined in Doctor █████'s report.</p><p>SCP-347's physical properties were not deleted and are currently being studied by Doctor █████'r███ and other personnel assigned to SCP-347.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-347 is a large number of SCP-███ instances. From the outside, its surface appears to resemble a blank wall, with no visible entrance or exit points. However, its composition has been altered such that it is now capable of altering itself to fit any dimensional environment.</p><p>Once a given environment is been established, SCP-347 will begin to organize itself into a city; this process takes approximately twenty (20) minutes to complete. Once the city has been completed, it will become impossible for personnel inside it to communicate with one another. Researchers within the city are able to communicate with each other over radio, as well as with personnel outside of the city.</p><p>Once assembled, objects in the city have properties consistent with their mass and dimensions when in an environment where they are not anomalous. The only item that does not conform to these rules is SCP-347; this state prevents its destruction. Smaller D-Class personnel will not be affected by SCP-347's anomalous properties and can be destroyed by SCP-347; however, destruction of large structures such as buildings will result in their growth until they are destroyed.</p><p>The origin of SCP-347 remains unknown; it was created by Doctor █████'r███ after an experiment involving SCP-███ caused his assistants to disappear and appear in an extra dimension. These assistants were found later within an altered state similar to that of SCP-███ and were designated SCP-347.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is Doctor █████'r███'s report on SCP-347.</p><p>The following is the report of Doctor █████'r███'s experiment involving SCP-███, resulting in the disappearance and appearance of SCP-347.</p><p>Experiment Log</p><p>Approximately three (3) minutes after the experiment was initiated, a loud screeching sound is heard. A number of MTF personnel are seen exiting the building in which the experiment was taking place. After the personnel have exited, they are discovered to have vanished from their locations; this includes Dr. █████'r███. Researchers are also unable to communicate with Dr. █████'r███ and he is seen to enter an altered state similar to that of SCP-███.</p><p>Several hours after the experiment had been initiated, Dr. █████'r███ is found outside of his office, inside an environment resembling that of a desert. Dr. █████'r███ is able to navigate the environment by using objects such as trees and rocks as landmarks; he is also able to read printed text through a pair of binoculars that were brought with him. Dr. █████'r███ is observed to be wearing casual clothing and appears to be dehydrated due to his prolonged exposure within the environment.</p><p>Doctor █████'r███ is then instructed to gather water from a nearby river; he does so and returns to his office several hours later. He finds that the rest of his staff have returned, but none of them remember having left the building. When questioned, they state they don't remember anything out of the ordinary occurring before they appeared in this new environment, and that it was only when they were returning to their own environments that they remembered their time spent in the other dimension.</p>
