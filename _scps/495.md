<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-495</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-495 is currently located outside of St. Louis, Missouri; where it has been kept as a living pet for nearly two years. It is fed three times a day in an effort to keep it distracted and fed. As SCP-495 is not physically capable of leaving the confines of its containment unit, no further containment procedures are necessary.</p><p>Experiments investigating the effect of SCP-495 on other animals are currently suspended until additional testing can be conducted with similar animals.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-495 is a light brown tabby cat, with a consistent white patch on its chest. Looking at it would cause the viewer to experience visual effects similar to that of catatonia. This effect only lasts for those who observe SCP-495; no non-human animals have been observed to experience the effect.</p><p>SCP-495 has one anomaly, however. On some days, SCP-495 will attempt to fly below the height of its enclosure. Once past this barrier, it appears as a black human silhouette and is capable of flight as if it were a bird. Further testing has proven that, on days when SCP-495 attempts this feat, there is a 19% chance that another animal will simultaneously attempt the same activity and be perceived as a human.</p><p>Further details: Experiment log</p><p>Date: ██/██/20██</p><p>Subject: D-4112</p><p>Notes: D-4112 was instructed to sit at the edge of SCP-495's containment unit. At a given signal, D-4112 was to jump over SCP-495's head so as not to trigger its effects. However, due to its immobility, it triggered SCP-495's burrowing effect instead, resulting in it digging through the floor of the containment unit and coming in contact with various metallic objects. Due to these materials' proximity to D-4112, he experienced visual effects similar to catatonia for approximately two minutes until SCP-495 was returned to its containment unit with minimal injury sustained by SCP-495 or D-4112.(See Addendum)</p><p>The events described in this experiment are not anomalous; however, adding significant psychological factors into the mix would reinforce the anomaly. Therefore, further experiments have been suspended until additional testing can be conducted using more controlled subjects.</p><p>Date: ██/██/20██</p><p>Subject: D-4955</p><p>Notes: D-4955 was instructed to sit upright at the edge of SCP-495's containment unit and watch as other experiment subjects were affected by SCP-495's effects (See Experiment Log). Upon doing so, D-4955 began screaming and kicking his legs repeatedly. When asked about his behavior during this time period, he stated: "I thought I saw… something.." He then appeared confused and requested that the test be suspended until he had recovered from the earlier incident.(See Addendum)3</p><p>Date: ██/██/20██</p><p>Subjects: D-1907 and D-2333</p><p>Notes: D-1907 was instructed to observe as other experimental subjects were affected by SCP-495's visual effects (See Experiment Log). After seeing that they did not perceive themselves as human shapes but cleared their vision immediately after attempting to do so, he screamed "No!" repeatedly and then proceeded to kick his legs incessantly for twenty seconds before being returned to his containment unit.(See Addendum 3)</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong> Upon further testing, D-1907 was subject to a visual effect similar to catatonia for twenty minutes. After this time period had passed, he began screaming in a similar fashion as D-4955 and kicked his legs incessantly for twenty seconds before being returned to his containment unit. However, during this period, D-1907 did not appear confused as he displayed normal human behavior and was able to communicate verbally.']</p>
