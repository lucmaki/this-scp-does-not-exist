<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-787</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area around SCP-787, including its boundary, is to have all civilian traffic halted, with the exception of local police. All external buildings within the area are to be kept intact at all times and civilian factions are to be left alone. Local authorities within the area are to be contacted and informed of the existence of this entity and the reasons for their quarantine.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-787 is a sovereign state in Europe, located close to the intersection of Eastern and Western Europe. It has been home to a human population of 30,000 inhabitants at its peak. SCP-787 claims itself to be an independent republic, with no ties to any other nation or government. This entity acts as a self-proclaimed government, with complete control over all of its citizens. Because of this, it is considered a Safe object.</p><p>The only foreign nations that have interacted with SCP-687 are those that have tried to annex the territory. These attempts have been unsuccessful due to the entity's anomalous properties. However, there have been reports of small groups of D-Class personnel that have escaped from the area into neighbouring nations.</p>
