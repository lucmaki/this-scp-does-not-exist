<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-155</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-155 must be kept in a standard containment locker. It must be kept behind a shatter-proof glass portal at all times. Tests must be conducted in a Class 4 Biohazard Containment Cell of at least 10,000 square meters.</p><p>SCP-155's containment area is to remain in a Type 2 Biohazard Containment Chamber. Any personnel entering the chamber must wear a full body suit and biohazard mask, or utilize an approved breathing apparatus. No personnel are allowed to enter without approval from the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-155 is a large sphere, measuring approximately 1.7 meters in diameter. It is constructed of a nearly impenetrable, glasslike substance that appears to be made of biological material (see Addendum 155-1). Despite its appearance, SCP-155 remains structurally sound.</p><p>When any living structure is breached by direct damage or force, it will begin to rapidly expand and deform until the structural integrity breaks down entirely and it will implode.</p><p>The rate at which the structure deforms is proportional to the amount of structural integrity remaining and henceforth follows Logarithmic Inverse Square law, with 1/25th of an ounce as the minimum viable unit.</p><p>Any object within a 25 meter radius will begin to rapidly expand and degrade in this manner unless an equal amount of mass is being added to it continuously.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
