<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-520</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-520 is secured in a standard containment locker at Site-██. SCP-520 is to be observed at all times for any signs of anomalous activity beyond the visual and audio capabilities of the researchers who examine it. In the event of SCP-520's destruction, no Foundation personnel are to view or possess knowledge of SCP-520-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-520 is a small, cylindrical device measuring 1.5 hp in mass and 22 cm in length, with a viewing portal at its centre. The portal remains unobscured and provides a clear image at all times. The viewing portal, when observed from within SCP-520's interior, shows an empty room with no apparent means of entry or exit. The object appears to be airtight, with no discernible leaks or damage.</p><p>When used for deflowering virgins, the viewing port will display video footage of its intended target's defloration process. This footage has been accurately described as "horrific", depicting the virgin being deflowered by several entities which lack a human appearance. However, despite this description, the identifications of these entities are as yet unknown. It should be noted that instances of SCP-520-1 display no sign of intelligence; they seem to operate purely on instinct and a drive to consume the target in whatever manner it sees fit. SCP-520 appears to have a unique effect on instances of SCP-520-1: each instance seems willing to sacrifice itself completely in pursuit of its goal.</p><p>SCP-520 was discovered in [DATA EXPUNGED]. Investigators examined the object for anomalous properties and determined it was not an anomaly; however, before an inquiry could be made about the fate of the donor, mass hysteria occurred throughout ████████ resulting in ██ fatalities from tornadoes and ███ injuries from lightning strikes. Dr. ████████ was able to recover the device in time to identify it as anomalous and prevent further loss of life; he brought it to Foundation attention after being contacted by local police investigating reports of multiple deaths at various locations across [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>While standard containment protocols are effective at keeping SCP-520 safe, testing has shown that brief exposure could result in dangerous side effects for those who view SCP-520. Approval is required by Dr█████████ for any such testing; further approval is required from Dr█████████ himself for anything which requires viewing the viewing portal directly.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 520-1:</strong> Incident 520-A</p><p>SCP-520 was used to deflower Dr. ████████'s daughter, ███████ ███████. As expected, SCP-520 displayed the defloration process and her eventual death by lightning strike. The only unusual change observed in this incident was that the lightning struck directly around Dr. ████████'s daughter rather than striking her directly. Upon questioning, Dr. ████████ stated that his daughter was always prone to fainting and had a natural death; he did not suspect that her death may have been caused by SCP-520.</p><p>The remains of SCP-520 were recovered from the scene of Incident 520-A along with the remains of SCP-520-1 instances A, B and C; these remain unidentified.</p>
