<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-520</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-520 is secured in a standard containment locker at Site-██. SCP-520 is to be observed at all times for any signs of anomalous activity beyond the visual and audio capabilities of the researchers who examine it. In the event of SCP-520's destruction, no Foundation personnel are to view or possess knowledge of SCP-520-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-520 is a small, cylindrical device measuring 1.5 hp in mass and 22 cm in length, with a viewing portal at its centre. The portal remains unobscured and provides a clear image at all times. The viewing portal, when observed from within SCP-520's interior, shows an empty room with no apparent means of entry or exit. The object appears to be airtight, with no discernible leaks or damage.</p><p>When used for deflowering virgins, the viewing port will display video footage of its intended target's defloration process. This footage has been accurately described as "horrific", depicting the virgin being deflowered by several entities which lack a human appearance. However, despite this description, the identifications of these entities are as yet unknown. It should be noted that instances of SCP-520-1 display no sign of intelligence; they seem to operate purely on instinct and a drive to consume the target in whatever manner it sees fit. SCP-520 appears to have a unique effect on instances of SCP-520-1: each instance seems willing to sacrifice itself completely in pursuit of its goal.</p><p>SCP-520 was discovered in [DATA EXPUNGED]. Investigators examined the object for anomalous properties and determined it was not an anomaly; however, before an inquiry could be made about the fate of the donor, mass hysteria occurred throughout ████████ resulting in ██ fatalities from tornadoes and ███ injuries from lightning strikes. Dr. ████████ was able to recover the device in time to identify it as anomalous and prevent further loss of life; he brought it to Foundation attention after being contacted by local police investigating reports of multiple deaths at various locations across [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>While standard containment protocols are effective at keeping SCP-520 safe, testing has shown that brief exposure could result in dangerous side effects for those who view SCP-520. Approval is required by Dr█████████ for any such testing; further approval is required from Dr█████████ himself for anything which requires viewing the viewing portal directly.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
