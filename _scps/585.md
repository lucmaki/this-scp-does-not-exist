<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-585</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-585 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell is to be furnished with a bed, desk, dresser and television set. A bookcase is to be provided for the storage of books and other reading materials. SCP-585 is to be permitted access to standard Foundation recreation items in addition to the bedding, desk, dresser and television set.</p><p>SCP-585 is not to have access to any object originating from outside of the North, South, East and West Hemisphere. SCP-585 is not allowed access to any equipment which could create an “object known only by its location”.</p><p>SCP-585 may request assistance from Agent ████ in creating and producing objects relating to its anomalous properties, however assistance must cease when SCP-585 has completed the requested item or has moved on to another subject. SCP-585 must be reminded that it is currently suspended in its own separate dimension, and as such cannot physically interact with any objects beyond that dimension.</p><p>Any attempts by SCP-1985 to pick up objects are to be met with immediate force. At this time, SCP-1985 has been informed of this policy.</p><p>If it becomes necessary for SCP-585 to leave its cell, it will be blindfolded and escorted in a standard humanoid containment suit. If any object originating from outside of the North, South, East and West Hemisphere is still in its possession after containment, it will be confiscated until such a time as it can be removed. Due to this particular object's location being unknown by all parties (see Test Log 585), this has yet to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-585 is a North American human male. SCP-585 is of average height, weight, and build. It has black hair and brown eyes. SCP-585's skin is pale with a light tan to it.</p><p>SCP-585 can move objects of its own volition, regardless of their location in the world outside of its own dimension. Approximately 40% of the time, this ability manifests as the movement of only one object from the known world, with no additional movement or disruption of anything else in that world or another dimension. When this ability manifests itself for more than one object, it typically appears as numerous identical copies of an object moving through multiple dimensions at once.</p><p>SCP-585 claims to be able to produce all items belonging to any specified type or variety when it directly states what is requested, however this has not been proven true so far.</p><p>SCP-585 was discovered after being reported missing from ████ High School by a teacher on ██/██/████ who had noticed unusual behavior from SCP-585 during a class discussion on anomalous objects. SCP-585 had become highly agitated and known to frequently speak out against the discussion on the nature of “non-object” entities and their relationships to SCP objects and other items originating from outside the North, South, East and West Hemisphere, including other Class D SCPs such as SCP-294 and SCP-413 . Other reports have also shown that SCP-585 has asserted that it is an “alien” that “does not belong” in our world along with several other instances of untruthful dialogue. However two days later (██/██/████) all reports ceased when Agent ████ reported that SCP-585 had vanished overnight without leaving behind any trace evidence aside from missing textbooks and personal belongings.</p><p>Test Log 585:</p><p>Agent █████ requests that SCP-585 create an object which affects themself rather than another individual based on agent's personal preference for the color red over blue, stating that "I'm tired of feeling pain all day I think I jus' want it EVERYWHERE". After stating this request aloud three times in quick succession, SCP-585 creates a duplicate copy of itself with its hands over head as if releasing an invisible projectile into the air. The copy releases three orange projectiles from its palms towards Agent █████, who inhales them each quickly before being affected by their effects prematurely. After approximately 6 seconds Agent █████ falls over backwards clutching his throat tightly before slumping to the ground unconscious. Upon picking up their copy from where they dropped it onto the floor Agent ████ instructed Agent █████ to read them appropriate personnel files regarding safety protocols for dealing with Class D SCPs and asked if he was okay to continue testing for any further anomalous effects which may manifest in his body but he denied any pain and stated he was fine (See Test Log 185)</p><p>Agent █████ orders SCP-585 to make a mechanical device capable of making coffee using hot water within their containment cell. While trying to complete this task Agent ████ informs Agent █████ that a coffee machine must be plugged into a wall outlet only found in North America while they were informed they could use an electric kettle instead (See Test Log 985)</p><p>Agent █████████ attempts to ask SCP-585 how long they have lived in their current location by stating "When did you start?" This request leads to Agent █████████ requesting that SCP-585 please make him something which lasts forever rather than something which does not exist in other dimensions, this request leads to Agent █████████ being assaulted by several copies of themselves covering their eyes and screaming at him repeatedly until he falls asleep again due to exhaustion. After waking up from this sleep agent claims he was seeing orbs flying just above his head which appear similar in size yet are completely separate entities connected only by their location (see Test Log 980). This test has been deemed inconclusive.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-585 is currently in containment for testing purposes. Please see Test Log 585 for more information.</p><p><strong>Testing Log 585:</strong></p><p>Agent ████ attempts to ask SCP-585 how long they have lived in their current location by stating "When did you start?"

After approximately 45 minutes Agent █████████ claims he has been able to see the objects from outside of their own dimension. It is unknown if this is due to SCP-585\'s ability or due to the fact that it has been brought outside of its own dimension. The objects can be seen outside of their dimension as well as inside of it, but not both at once.']</p>
