<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-401</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to maintain its concealment from all but the most stringent of observers and maintain a strict policy regarding the protection of SCP-400's content. All persons attempting to access the disinformation campaign involving SCP-400 are to be intercepted, detained, and interrogated until they admit they have not investigated it on their own.</p><p>Any individual suspected of being aware of the existence of SCP-400 is to be amnesticized and given orders to report nothing more than sightings of unusual animal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-400 is a book written by one Dr. Aaron Ishii, which describes the creation of SCP-400. The Foundation has been unable to locate the original work, although it is clear that Ishii published several similar texts between 1973 and 1997.</p><p>Dr. Ishii claims to have met and studied with a civilization known as the "Mangalantras", which he describes as peaceful until being destroyed by an unknown event known as "the Curse". The Mangalantras are said to have taught him the mind controlling properties of Parachromacy, making him responsible for their creation. He claims that the Wrack, a race of avian humanoid beings of great intelligence, were created from the memories erased from their minds before they were destroyed. He states that he used this "Mindcasting" to create a race of perfect warriors powerful enough to overcome any threat to his goals. He then used these creatures as his guards throughout his career in order to protect his information from those seeking it, naming them the "Mindcorps". Due to this secret society's dedication to protecting him and his work from prying eyes, he invented an impossible weapon called "Prana-Chi", which he believes will be able to eliminate all threats posed against it, including itself.</p><p>Dr. Ishii claims that forced secrecy has left the Mindcorps in a precarious situation in which they are becoming more violent with each passing day. He believes that by revealing himself and his secrets through this book he can save what remains of them and prevent them from being destroyed entirely by some unknown threat never seen before by modern science or history. All people who have read 300 pages have described identical emotions - half amusement at their own ignorance and arrogance, but also fear at what they have learned during their brief time with SCP-400. Most subjects report feeling compelled to continue reading beyond this point even under coercion or coercion attempts; due to the extreme danger involved no further subjects have been tested on for fear of triggering the initial test subjects' compulsion.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-342 was first discovered on ██/01/2001, when a Foundation agent was sent to investigate a possible anomaly near ███████. Upon reaching the object, he reported that he could see a route through it. A radio transmission to Mobile Task Force Epsilon-7 (Mobile Task Force Omicron-7) was attempted; however, the signal was blocked by an unknown factor.</p><p>The following objects were observed traversing SCP-342 between the dates noted in brackets:</p>
