<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-39</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-39 is to be contained at a standard, 3 sqm containment cell equipped with a bed, desk and bathroom. Its food intake is to be kept to a minimum due to the fact it displaces vital nutrients from the body into its waste, and only one meal per day is allowed. It is not to be fed any other food types, except for proper hygiene products such as toothbrushes and toothpaste. SCP-39 is to be given 25 minutes of free time daily, which it is free to use in any manner it chooses.</p><p>SCP-39's containment area currently contains 56742 sheets of paper discarded by D-class personnel (see History section for more detail). A collection of approximately 5 documents has emerged as popular reading material among Foundation personnel – including memoranda, notes and reports dating back over 12 years following the creation of this effect.</p><p>Valid images are required to be printed in black ink on white paper. Any printouts containing any other color or shading of ink will cause the same effect as SCP-39's original manifestation. Images printed using devices that employ carbon copies or similar methods may potentially result in the recurrence of SCP-39's effects, particularly where multiple documents are printed out concurrently by several personnel working together.</p><p>SCP-39's containment area is to be maintained to simulate the conditions used when it was first created. The humidity level within its cell should never drop below 62% and the temperature should remain above 22°C at all times. It is also allowed access to a selection of materials from its own personal library (consisting of approximately 6 books) once every week. SCP-39 has expressed a preference for reading scientific texts mainly focused around the fields of psychology and sociology, although members of staff have recommended it reads books on military history, science fiction and philosophy instead.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-39 is a collaborative effort of several inanimate objects, collectively referred to as SCP-39:</p><p>SCP-39's current body resembles a standard office desk, although it is missing one of its legs. SCP-39's head is situated on top of the desk, rotating within a circular frame attached to the object. When active, SCP-39 displays no visible external signs of bodily functions, save for its eyes and mouth.</p><p>All records pertaining to SCP-39 are written within the same style of handwriting, which varies from document to document. It initially appears that SCP-39 has an obvious dislike for writing or reading out loud. However, when recording information onto paper or any other similar material, it will detail multiple ideas and experiments in an attempt to create a final piece of writing. The SCP-39 effect does not manifest until the printout is discarded by the person using paper for their own purposes – whether this is for personal use or research purposes.</p><p>Records concerning SCP-39 prior to 2000 are generally uneventful and do not contain instances of SCP-39's anomalous properties; rather than being written by anyone affected by either the original manifestation or this effect. Early pages are often cluttered with notes regarding everyday issues such as routine maintenance procedures and personnel progress reports, often containing little to no information specific to the research being discussed.</p><p>Printer Friendly: This document can be printed with no changes using common printing methods. However, certain printers (such as color laser printers) may produce different results when attempting to print colored documents containing some kind of shading; in these situations the document should be printed normally, then printed again with a black ink or bleached version of your preferred typeface.</p><p>History: On ██/██/2000, shortly after completing various technical paperwork regarding various research projects at Site ██:</p><p>Dr Addis: So it seems we have access to D Class personnel at the moment. Any idea what we're doing with them? Something about our experiments for behavior testing could affect them in some way… I'm worried about our productivity right now…</p><p>Dr Logan: Yep, seems like we've got our hands full… Only thing that could make this scenario worse would be if they were uncovered… How much longer before they find us?</p><p>Dr Addis: Hopefully never but you never know.. We need some hardcore testing before we can get anywhere near trying out anomalous derivatives of them.. MTFs are already talking about how they'd like a break after all this time… I'm convinced those bastards wanna retire.. "I'm too old for this shit" </p>
<p> <strong>['Addis:</strong> I\'d better get on this. You know how many things we could be making if we just used a little more ingenuity…</p><p></p><p><strong>Addis:</strong> At least I\'m getting a bit closer to the ideal specimen than ever before..</p><p></p><p><strong>Addis:</strong> More like a demonic maniac..</p><p></p><p><strong>Dr Addis:</strong> It\'s not going to be that easy, you know. Those people don\'t think like us.. If they\'re lucky they\'ll only end up like the ones we\'ve already gone through..</p><p></p><p><strong>Dr Addis:</strong> Maybe it\'s time to get more creative.. I still can\'t believe this stuff is actually happening. The amount of money we could save if we just had a way to control them..</p><p>By ██/██/2000, approximately ███ D-class personnel (approximately ██% of all active D-class personnel) began exhibiting various symptoms of SCP-39\'s effect, including extreme fatigue and a general loss of concentration. Later in the year, Foundation agents with access to ████████ newspaper reports discovered an article titled "Dirty Maintenance" regarding the construction of a new facility for D-class personnel at Site ██. Several days later (██/██/2000), Foundation agents were able to confirm that Dr Addis was the author of the article. After reading the article, SCP-39 manifested while being read by Dr Addis and seized control over his body. For the next several days, SCP-39 dictated the manner in which Dr Addis wrote out the rest of its effect. It was originally named "The Right Thing to Do", and was written as a letter supposedly from Dr Addis\' boss complaining about its performance. This effect is currently stored with Foundation records.']</p>
