<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-22</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-22 is currently contained at Site 34, a facility inaccessible by land. By all means, discourage the use of SCP-22 by civilians.</p><p>Information about SCP-22 must be classified as "restricted", and access to that information is granted only to Level 4 personnel with a level of clearance appropriate for the level of information in question. Subjects who are taking medication with an effect similar to amnestics should be given the usual clearance requirements, but not all medications have the same side effects or intensity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-22 is a device resembling a small computerized pocket calculator. It takes the form of a black plastic handle, approximately three and a half inches long, with a dial on top and a set of buttons along one side. SCP-22 weighs fifty nine grams and is equipped with a three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope for basic orientation. The main input mechanism is light detection, with an infrared attachment built into the back. SCP-22 functions as a functional calculator; however, it will not function properly in any application that requires more than basic arithmetic using pencil and paper.</p><p>Subjects who use SCP-22 to function as calculators will have their math skills affected in the same way as if they had been using SCP-22 for its original purpose. Subjects usually lose all ability to perform arithmetic operations involving simple integers, and will invariably perform incorrect calculations unless the subject is made aware that they are performing such calculations by another human being or some other external source.</p><p>Addition of higher numbers beyond the first is unaffected by the effect: when a subject learns how to add two three-digit numbers, they will be unable to perform the calculation when asked to do so on paper or into their phone's calculator application, but they can still perform the calculation in their head while holding SCP-22 in a loop around their finger. For example, 597 × 7 equals 4111, but 2403 = [5+9+1]×7(2)</p><p>Example: -████-, performing addition mentally</p><p>⇐ + 3 + []2 + []3 + 4[]4 + [5+6+[]6]7 × ╚ ╚ ╚ ╚ೣೣೣೣೣೣೣೣೣೣ2[2][2][2][2][2][3/4]1561/178822276833233334567890123485587654321= 5328246508465384444444444444444444444444445 ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ If only we could add like she did! ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ</p><p>Addition can be performed mentally as long as fingers remain on SCP-22's keys.</p>
<p> ["Addition can be performed mentally as long as hands are not touching SCP-22's keys.</p><p>The calculator effect is not limited to addition; it also affects multiplication and division. Multiplication is most often encountered, and failure to recognize the problem will result in a subject losing a significant portion of their mental calculation abilities.</p><p>Division is a much less common occurrence, but the problem is the same: after learning how to perform division mentally, subjects lose the ability to perform the calculation on paper, although they can still perform it in their heads.</p><p>Addition is significantly easier to perform mentally than calculation of fractions, such as 1/3 or 2/5, although it is still possible for subjects to lose the ability to calculate them mentally.</p><p>With proper instruction, subjects can learn to perform addition mentally even when their hands are not on SCP-22. In these cases, however, it is important that all other factors remain the same. For example, if SCP-22 is removed from a subject's hand, they will immediately lose all ability to do mental addition."]</p>
