<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-858</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> At least one human must be acting as an armed and mobile thermometer at all times. The heat range of SCP-858 is to be monitored remotely, with the highest temperature reading being noted. Thermal imaging is not to be used in proximity to SCP-858 due to its disruptive nature.</p><p>Any and all personnel entering SCP-858 are to wear flame-retardant clothing and gas masks. SCP-858's temperature should not exceed 572 °C (1,076 °F), at which point it will convert into a supervolcanic eruption. This area is to be declared a no-go zone and any personnel attempting to enter the area are currently Class III amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-858 is an igneous intrusion in the far eastern part of the Volcanic Islands, in the Pacific Ocean. SCP-858 is a volcanic plug, with an average diameter of 2.2 km (approximately 1 mile). The outer surface of SCP-858 has a slightly luminescent appearance; additional testing is required to determine if this nature is unique to SCP-858.</p><p>At temperatures below 572 °C (1,076 °F), SCP-858 will convert into an explosive plasma column that erupts at a rate of approximately 30m per second. During this process, SCP-858's size will increase by 50%, while its volume remains constant. The lava ejected from SCP-858 also grows in temperature and density, reaching temperatures of ██60 °C (████] C) and ██[REDACTED] m per second respectively. Any and all material ejected from SCP-858 during this eruption will collide with the dense crust surrounding it and become embedded within it, forming more molten rock that can be ejected again if the eruption continues; thus creating a self-renewing event.</p><p>The temperature at which this occurs is currently unknown; however, the temperature reached by columns of lava has been measured at ███[REDACTED] C and ███ m per second. Furthermore, any on-site personnel with heat sensors have indicated that temperatures well within SCP-858's temperature range are not registering on their equipment.</p><p>SCP-858 was discovered at ██/██/████, by personnel stationed in the Volcanic Islands during routine exploration of earthquakes in eastern Pacific Ocean area 742A. Foundation investigation revealed that approximately ██% of indigenous Fijian were killed by lava erupting from SCP-858 over a period of ██ hours. This eruption destroyed infrastructure throughout Fijian territories for a radius of 2 kilometers, sinking several fishing boats and killing ██ people after debris landed on them or plowed through them. Further seismic activity was reported from US territories bordering Fijian borders as well as other Pacific provinces bordering Fiji after this incident.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 858-1:</strong> Attempts to create a containment breach using SCP-858 have been unsuccessful. When the temperature of the lava reaches 572 C, the outer surface becomes extremely volatile and explosive, producing plasma columns and detonating with a force equivalent to ████ tons of TNT.</p>
