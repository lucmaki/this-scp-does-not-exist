<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-764</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-764 is to be stored in directly-accessible cold storage at Site-77. Testing with SCP-764 requires the prior approval of Dr. █████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-764 is a sealed package of hot dogs (brand unidentified) found with minor scorch marks on the center label. The package weighs 28.67 kg.</p><p>When opened and consumed, each instance of SCP-764 will ignite in the mouth and produce sufficient heat to cause severe internal burns to the user. This effect is not effective against oral consumption of SCP-764; however, when used to warm proper foodstuffs, such as bread or other baked items, there will be no carnivorous effect. Testing has so far failed to replicate this result upon consumption of raw meat products.</p><p>SCP-764's primary danger is its combustible nature coupled with its unusual location; if its seal is broken, SCP-764 should be rendered completely inedible in order to prevent instances from spontaneously igniting as they are being consumed. SCP-764 should be considered uncontainable until its anomalous properties are rendered harmless. Experiments designed to further study its properties have been approved pending successful tests of this kind.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
