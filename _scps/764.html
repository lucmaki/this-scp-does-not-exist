<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-764</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-764 is to be stored in directly-accessible cold storage at Site-77. Testing with SCP-764 requires the prior approval of Dr. █████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-764 is a sealed package of hot dogs (brand unidentified) found with minor scorch marks on the center label. The package weighs 28.67 kg.</p><p>When opened and consumed, each instance of SCP-764 will ignite in the mouth and produce sufficient heat to cause severe internal burns to the user. This effect is not effective against oral consumption of SCP-764; however, when used to warm proper foodstuffs, such as bread or other baked items, there will be no carnivorous effect. Testing has so far failed to replicate this result upon consumption of raw meat products.</p><p>SCP-764's primary danger is its combustible nature coupled with its unusual location; if its seal is broken, SCP-764 should be rendered completely inedible in order to prevent instances from spontaneously igniting as they are being consumed. SCP-764 should be considered uncontainable until its anomalous properties are rendered harmless. Experiments designed to further study its properties have been approved pending successful tests of this kind.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 764-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, a package of SCP-764 was discovered in a New York City apartment containing the remains of one deceased individual (D-████) as well as two additional instances of SCP-764. The cause of death was determined to be severe burns consistent with SCP-764's effects. Autopsy established that there were no biological anomalies present in the body other than the three instances of SCP-764.</p><p>Foundation personnel entered the residence and removed all relevant evidence; the affected individuals were brought to Site-77 for experimentation with SCP-764.</p>
