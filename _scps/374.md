<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-374</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has established a web of fake dating sites, such as “The Dating Guide for 7-15 Year Olds” and “The Dating Service for 9-11 Year Olds”, designed to allow testing of SCP-374.</p><p>Any instances of SCP-374-1 currently within the scope of Foundation control are to be secured and frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-374 is an anomalous memetic phenomenon affecting individuals of either gender between the ages of 1 and 72.</p><p>SCP-374-1 are organisms (referred to as SCP-374-1 instances) capable of expressing both romantic and sexual desire towards any entity capable of meeting their needs. The majority of SCP-374-1 instances have no qualms about discussing or going through with such a relationship, and show a lack of regard for the age difference. Like all other SCP objects, SCP-374-1 instances are referred to by designations: SCP-374-1/A (adult female), SCP-374-1/B (adult male), SCP-374-1/C (child), and so on, with “?” denoting an unknown instance of SCP biology.</p><p>Nonessential organs (such as the heart and liver) are unaffected by SCP-374; however, any organ affected by the memetic effect will begin to regenerate at anomalously high rates. Organ regeneration does not occur in the presence of sapient lifeforms in healthy states until several months have passed. If necessary, this can be further accelerated by amplifying the memetic effect by use of somatic amnestics.</p><p>The brain remains unaffected unless the organism's condition attains a score of 68 or higher on the Safety Stockpile's Surgery Scale. Once this point has been reached, the still intact parts of an organism's brain begin to enter into an altered state that mimics death while simultaneously producing amnestics. This process has been shown to be more suitable than the more traumatic methods often used in human experimentation due to the ease with which it can be performed without permanent damage; should it be completed without death occurring, the subject is designated SCP-374/434a2.</p><p>Organ regeneration ceases one month after death occurs, at which point any organs removed during this process may be reattached and eventually remain functional.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-374 is believed to be caused by the memetic effect of SCP-374-1 instances on human subjects, which is amplified by use of somatic amnestics. The Foundation has classified SCP-374 as an SCP object due to its potential anomalous properties, but has not yet determined whether it is a Safe or Euclid object.</p><p>On 06/03/2016, the SCP Foundation conducted a raid on a residence in ██████, █████. At the time of capture, SCP-374-1/C was found in a comatose state inside her home, with no signs of injury. The subject had a safety rating of 68 on the Surgery Scale, but was successfully reattached using standard Foundation procedure.</p><p>The following report was written by Dr. ████████ during the recovery process.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> “Miss, can you hear me?”</p><p><strong>SCP-374-1/C:</strong> “Yes. I can see and hear you now, Doctor. Good.”</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> “It's very good to hear that, Miss. Are you comfortable?”</p><p><strong>SCP-374-1/C:</strong> “I'm not sure… I don't seem to be able to move very much, but otherwise I feel fine.”</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> “That's good to hear, Miss. Can you tell us your name?”</p><p><strong>SCP-374-1/C:</strong> “My name… my name is… I can't remember my last name… I don't know…”</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> “Can you tell us where you are?”</p><p><strong>SCP-374-1/C:</strong> “I'm in my bed… I'm in my bedroom. But it's so dark in here… Where's everyone else? Where's Doctor?”</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> “Are you alone, Miss?”</p><p><strong>SCP-374-1/C:</strong> “No… No, Doctor is here with me… He told me he'd come back for me… Oh God…”</p><p>The subject begins to sob uncontrollably for several minutes before ceasing all vocalization and returning to a state of unconsciousness.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> “Miss, can you tell us if you're hurt anywhere?”</p><p><strong>SCP-374-1/C:</strong> “No Doctor… No… I can't feel anything else… Am I alright? Am I going to be alright?”</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> “Miss? How long have you been asleep for, Miss?”</p><p><strong>SCP-374-1/C:</strong> “I don't know… It feels like forever, but it can't be very long at all… What happened? Why can't I remember anything? How did this happen?”</p><p>Doctor ██████████ enters the room shortly thereafter and begins the process of waking up his patient. After approximately 15 minutes of conversation regarding her condition, SCP-374-1/C begins to regain consciousness; however, she experiences some difficulty recalling events leading up to her current state of being and expresses general anxiety throughout the entire recovery process. Despite this and the fact that no evidence of damage has been found on her body, Dr. ██████████ assures her that she is healthy and in good health and that she should be released from Foundation custody within three weeks and returned to her home within the month following this interview. SCP-374-1/C expresses gratitude towards both Drs. ██████████ and ████████ and expresses a desire to return to her home as soon as possible."]</p>
