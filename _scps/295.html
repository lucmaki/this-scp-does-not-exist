<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-295</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-295 is to be housed in a standard containment chamber with all facilities, personnel and equipment at Site-██. This chamber is to be fitted with a motion detector to prevent the manifestation of SCP-295. A large keter containment cell is to be constructed around the perimeter of the chamber for additional security measures. All personnel entering SCP-295's containment chamber must wear full-body protective suits. Approved personnel only; see addendum below.</p><p>All personnel entering SCP-295's containment chamber are required to conduct a written survey on their experience prior to entering the room. Failure to complete the survey will result in immediate termination. Any surviving members of the assigned personnel will be given amnestics and given a replacement position if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-295 (Mimeograph Copying Machine) is a 4m tall, black device recessed into the wall of SCP-295's containment chamber. SCP-295 will seemingly vanish into the wall, only to reappear elsewhere in the same room. It does not possess any components typically found on standard equipment for mimeograph machines, such as ink or paper.</p><p>SCP-295 appears to have four "targets" or "objectives" which it will attempt to complete during its manifestation; these objectives are dependent on the current operational state of SCP-295. This operational state can be determined by the position of a red light located at the bottom of SCP-295. The following are each of SCP-295's operational states:</p><p>Each objective requires either special tools or tools that could not be obtained anywhere on Earth, including items that were created in other universes. In 26% of tests, a separate item is required to complete the objective; these items can be found anywhere on Earth, even if they were not manufactured here.</p><p>Approval Required To Enter: Only approved personnel are allowed access to SCP-295; see addendum below for details. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to enter SCP-295's containment chamber will be terminated upon arrival.</p><p>A complete list of all personnel who have been approved and have entered SCP-295's containment chamber may be found here</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Below is a list of all personnel who have been approved to enter SCP-295's containment chamber.</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Testing?</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> Yes, testing. How may I help you?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Well, how do you know where I am?</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> As an example, do you want to use this?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Yes, can you give me an example of what?</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> What do you want to use it for?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> I need it to make copies.</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> Alright. Go ahead.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Okay, so what exactly does it do?</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> Well, it will copy whatever you are currently looking at. If there is no subject in focus, it will take a picture of the space in front of it. If there is a subject in focus, it will copy whatever you are writing on the copy pad. If you want to copy something other than paper and writing, you will have to use a special tool for that.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Gotcha… so what do I do?</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> [The red light begins to flash.] What do you want to copy?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Paper.</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> Are you sure? There is this new type of ink that might be better; see if you like it. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the paper isn't going to last very long when copied with this machine. It's also going to cost you double, but if you want more copies made, let me know and I'll put in a special order.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Copy paper works just fine, thanks. Now what exactly do I do?</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> Just look at the paper and write down anything that comes to mind. You can copy it later if you like; or save the writing if you don't have something else to copy with this machine. Same thing applies if you don't have anything else; if you have something else to work with, write down your thoughts about the paper for now and use it later for copying if you need it. Now please step away from the equipment, we can talk after you finish your test.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Whatever, okay…</p><p>[The red light flashes.]</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> Hello again Dr. █████████! How did the first test go?</p><p><strong>Dr. █████████:</strong> Well, it seems pretty pointless really; all it does is copy what I'm looking at, which isn't really much of a bonus as far as I'm concerned… but I needed some extra copies made and copying paper wasn't an option for me, so yeah… however I didn't get any useful information out of it myself… so I guess we'll try again tomorrow when I can actually make something useful from this thing… or maybe not even tomorrow… maybe never…</p><p>[The red light flashes.]</p><p><strong>SCP-295:</strong> You're still here… did anything interesting happen today? Or is this just a waste of time? Or both? Oh well, why don't we try something different and see how that goes? Okay then, let's try copying live subjects today shall we? Let's start off with some babies and see what happens!</p><p><strong>Dr. █████████:</strong> Okay… I guess that's fine then… great idea… wait a second though; how exactly am I supposed to do that? Am I supposed to touch them or something? Do they even have their own bodies or something similar enough to be considered living tissue; they all look like they're made up of empty space!?! What the hell?! How am I supposed to touch them?! You're just going to let a bunch of idiots walk around touching babies?! At least give us a description about how this thing works before we go through with this stupid test! What kind of vague instructions are we getting here?! Why does everything seem so vague and oblique?! We're letting people walk around a room full of babies! That should be illegal! This is dangerous! This shouldn't be allowed! Seriously guys, this could be catastrophic for humanity!! What the hell are we doing?! We are going over the line here guys!! We are allowing people to walk around touching babies!! This has got to stop right now!! Anyone who thinks this is safe needs their heads checked!! In fact anyone who thinks these things aren't dangerous should be taken out and shot immediately!!! All your equipment is unsafe! Security has been compromised! Alert everyone!! Start evacuating immediately!! Get everyone out of this facility!!! STOP THIS TEST IMMEDIATELY!!! NO ONE IS TO ENTER THE CONTAINMENT CHAMBER UNTIL WE ARE SURE EVERYONE'S SAFE!! UNDERSTAND!! GET OUT OF MY OFFICE NOW!!!!>*exited*< SCP-295 leaves containment chamber</p>
