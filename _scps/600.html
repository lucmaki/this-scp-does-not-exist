<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-600</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid Neutral</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-600 instances are to be supplied with a GPS tracking device and monitored via satellite at all times. Any entity traveling near one of the SCP-600 instances will be recorded, whether known or unknown to Foundation staff.</p><p>Foundation researchers are to maintain a list of known SCP-600 instances in order of discovery, along with personnel assigned to research the objects' properties and how they relate to SCP-600.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-600 instances are physical objects of variable appearance and size. The object in question will be non-anomalous and have no unusual properties. The SCP-600 instance continues to function as it would when alone, with the exception of receiving and transmitting signals originating within the frame of an existing SCP-600 instance.</p><p>The number of entities (entities include living beings, vehicles, replicas of living beings, inanimate objects and other SCP-600 instances) that can properly interact with one SCP-600 instance is currently unknown.</p><p>When a known or unknown agent attempts to approach an SCP-600 instance, the entity will receive a text message containing the following message:</p><p>Reach point ██ meters behind your current position</p><p>Do nothing until you reach point ██ meters behind your current position</p><p>You have now reached point ██ meters behind your current position</p><p>The next step is not clear to us at this time</p><p>Once an entity has received these instructions, they will move along an invisible wall parallel to the original location of their vehicle or person. If traffic is present, this motion will continue at varying speeds until the limit of visibility is reached. Vehicles that pass through SCP-600 instances display no change in state. Individuals who travel through SCP-600 instances via nonliving means do not appear affected by the mechanisms used; such persons report feeling as though they were actually walking through space along a path visible through SCP-600 instances.</p><p>SCP-600 instances neutralize their effects when no entities are within 10 km of them. The effect of this lasts until another updated GPS signal is received from any nearby SCP-600 instance, at which point it restarts again. No two instances have synchronized clocks, which prevents the neutralization effect from being possible. In addition to neutralizing its effect on entities, SCP-600 also has a tendency to cancel out any other anomalous behavior occurring near it; such behavior includes motorized vehicles exceeding 433 km/h (teleportation), and most forms of teleportation outside of SCP-4210's effect. As a result, Foundation research into both phenomena has shifted significantly towards understanding how SCP-600 behaves when operated simultaneously with other anomalies. This does not prevent the use of nonanomalous methods for transportation near SCP-600; however, attempting to transport living subjects inside an inactive SCP underwater will result in prompt termination by armed personnel should the subject fail to abort their attempt moments before reaching 1 km underwater due to anomalous interference from nearby objects and surfaces. All personnel operating under such orders are required to undergo training in underwater rescue procedures as part of their regular field agent preparation process.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
