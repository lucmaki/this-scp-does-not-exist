<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-600</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid Neutral</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-600 instances are to be supplied with a GPS tracking device and monitored via satellite at all times. Any entity traveling near one of the SCP-600 instances will be recorded, whether known or unknown to Foundation staff.</p><p>Foundation researchers are to maintain a list of known SCP-600 instances in order of discovery, along with personnel assigned to research the objects' properties and how they relate to SCP-600.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-600 instances are physical objects of variable appearance and size. The object in question will be non-anomalous and have no unusual properties. The SCP-600 instance continues to function as it would when alone, with the exception of receiving and transmitting signals originating within the frame of an existing SCP-600 instance.</p><p>The number of entities (entities include living beings, vehicles, replicas of living beings, inanimate objects and other SCP-600 instances) that can properly interact with one SCP-600 instance is currently unknown.</p><p>When a known or unknown agent attempts to approach an SCP-600 instance, the entity will receive a text message containing the following message:</p><p>Reach point ██ meters behind your current position</p><p>Do nothing until you reach point ██ meters behind your current position</p><p>You have now reached point ██ meters behind your current position</p><p>The next step is not clear to us at this time</p><p>Once an entity has received these instructions, they will move along an invisible wall parallel to the original location of their vehicle or person. If traffic is present, this motion will continue at varying speeds until the limit of visibility is reached. Vehicles that pass through SCP-600 instances display no change in state. Individuals who travel through SCP-600 instances via nonliving means do not appear affected by the mechanisms used; such persons report feeling as though they were actually walking through space along a path visible through SCP-600 instances.</p><p>SCP-600 instances neutralize their effects when no entities are within 10 km of them. The effect of this lasts until another updated GPS signal is received from any nearby SCP-600 instance, at which point it restarts again. No two instances have synchronized clocks, which prevents the neutralization effect from being possible. In addition to neutralizing its effect on entities, SCP-600 also has a tendency to cancel out any other anomalous behavior occurring near it; such behavior includes motorized vehicles exceeding 433 km/h (teleportation), and most forms of teleportation outside of SCP-4210's effect. As a result, Foundation research into both phenomena has shifted significantly towards understanding how SCP-600 behaves when operated simultaneously with other anomalies. This does not prevent the use of nonanomalous methods for transportation near SCP-600; however, attempting to transport living subjects inside an inactive SCP underwater will result in prompt termination by armed personnel should the subject fail to abort their attempt moments before reaching 1 km underwater due to anomalous interference from nearby objects and surfaces. All personnel operating under such orders are required to undergo training in underwater rescue procedures as part of their regular field agent preparation process.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum SCP-600-B:</strong> SCP-600 was discovered in the aftermath of an incident involving both the SCP-600 Foundation and the SCP-4210 Foundation. The two groups had engaged in a vitriolic disagreement over their respective research into the subject of SCP-4210, with the defection of seven Foundation members to the 4210 Foundation following. The two groups then engaged in a series of increasingly dangerous confrontations.</p><p>On 8/28/2003, the 4210 Foundation\'s "Genesis" was destroyed by a group of Foundation agents and a group of Agents from the SCP-600 Foundation, who were attempting to neutralize SCP-600\'s effect on SCP-4210. A video recording of this event was taken by an unidentified survivor.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The following text is transcribed from the video recording.</p><p><strong>(Note:</strong> Video quality is poor, but clear enough to read most individual words.)</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>[The camera moves forward and zooms in on Agent ██████\'s corpse.]</p><p>Agent ██████ appears to be dead. His body has not been moved since this point.</p><p>[The camera tracks to follows one of the surviving Foundation agents rushing towards a nearby vehicle.]</p><p>It appears as though Agent ██████ is still alive; however, he appears to be severely injured and unable to move.</p><p>[The vehicle appears in frame and drives off at high speed.]</p><p>[The camera follows the vehicle at a distance for several moments before coming to a halt.]</p><p>The vehicle drives over a tree, briefly stops and then proceeds to continue driving along its original path, unaffected by its surroundings.</p><p>[The vehicle continues moving through an area devoid of trees, indistinguishable from any other area of forest]</p><p>[The vehicle enters a clearing and slows down. The video begins to shake violently.]</p><p>A large number of SCP-600 instances appear in view; all instances are active and appear to be doing nothing more than existing. One instance is clearly visible to the camera as it moves between vehicles other than the one it originally occupied; this instance is neutralized as it moves along with another instance, which also appears to be neutralized as it moves between two other vehicles. The process repeats itself several times over the course of several minutes before all instances cease movement and return to their previous behavior. The camera shakes violently for several minutes before returning to normal until losing power.</p>
