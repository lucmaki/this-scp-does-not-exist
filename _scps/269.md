<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-269</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-269 requires to be handled in a gold case from now on, including during transportation. The case must always remain closed and locked.</p><p>The Foundation is to maintain a containment team at the location of SCP-269's discovery. All conversations with SCP-269 are to be recorded, transcribed and reported to Dr O███.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-269 is a blue crystal, measuring 0.62 centimeters in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. SCP-269's anomalous effects only occur near SCP-269 itself, or when it is physically handled by the human hand.</p><p>SCP-269's effect occurs when it is taken in the hand, seemingly causing a "magic moment" that disconnects the surrounding environment from the brainwaves of the subject. The subject will soon slip into a coma-like state, which lasts between one and three minutes before abruptly ending.</p><p>If any other lifeform touches SCP-269 during this time, they will experience similarly disconnected reality as the original subject, with most notably no memory of their previous existence or possession of SCP-269.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 269-1:</strong> Interview Log</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr O███</p><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> D-0445</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p><strong>Dr O███:</strong> Good morning D-0445, it's good to see you again.</p><p>The D-class is seated in a chair, and salutes. He then looks over the interviewer's shoulder at the camera.</p><p><strong>D-0445:</strong> Yes sir. I've been ready for a while now.</p><p><strong>Dr O███:</strong> Would you mind telling me about your experience? I want to make sure that what we discussed today will be of any help.</p><p><strong>D-0445:</strong> Yes sir. Well, I've been awake for a while now. I had this weird sensation on my hand when I woke up earlier, like a chain reaction... no, more like a chain reaction of something else happening inside my head.</p><p><strong>Dr O███:</strong> Please describe it in detail.</p><p><strong>D-0445:</strong> It was just an empty landscape, as far as I could see. But there were other things living inside it too. Not alive, but they made sense with the landscape, just not much sense in the landscape itself. Like an art gallery of painting with different subjects but no context on why they're there or how they relate to each other. There was one of these paintings but it wasn't connected to anything in the room and there was no way to look at it from different angles and perspectives. The painting was just there, and that's all I can say about it.</p><p>After making several attempts to describe SCP-269, D-0445 falls asleep for the remainder of the interview. Dr O███ continues questioning when D-0445 wakes up again."]</p>
