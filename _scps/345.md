<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-345</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid-Po</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-345 is kept in a locker in a Geological and Paleontological research facility. Researchers should not approach it without the presence of several security personnel, as contact with its surface causes extreme psychological distress.</p><p>As SCP-345 is known to be hard to destroy, no action is currently taken to contain it. In case of emergency, it may be destroyed by dropping a large stone on top of it. This can be repeated as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-345 is a metallic cylinder, roughly 8 m long and 4 m high. Its surface looks like a map of the world's ocean depths. A detailed map of the Atlantic Ocean has been made using SCP-345, but it is invisible to all except underwater creatures.</p><p>SCP-345 was found on the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Greenland by several fisherman who were unaware of its anomalous properties. Dr. █████, Senior Researcher for the Department of Geological Sciences, was observing SCP-345 when it suddenly activated, causing severe dizziness and nausea to her. She soon recovered and confirmed that SCP-345 emitted an unusually strong magnetic field that forced nearby iron objects to align with it; this behavior had been observed in previous tests. Both Foundation personnel involved were informed of its anomalous properties but decided not to report them at the time.</p><p>The Foundation acquired SCP-345 from Dr. █████ after her retirement from the Foundation and transferred it to a suitable containment unit. Containment procedures have been updated over time in response to changes in the object and its effects.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Discovery of SCP-345's effect on non-metallic objects.</p><p>On ██/██/2012, Dr. █████ investigated the effect of SCP-345 on other types of materials by placing several different objects (including several non-metallic substances) close to the object. The following are notes she took while attempting to discern the effects of SCP-345 on objects that do not contain iron.</p><p>Objects placed near SCP-345 appear to align themselves with it, as expected.</p><p>Objects appear to be drawn towards SCP-345 if they are magnetic. This is not consistent, however.</p><p>Objects appear to become more magnetic after being near SCP-345, which might be due to an electromagnetic field emitted by the object.</p><p>Several objects are drawn toward SCP-345 without becoming magnetic at all. This is not consistent, however; some items maintain a constant magnetic field, while others lose it completely.</p><p>Objects that retain their magnetic field after being near SCP-345 are affected by the magnetic force exerted on them by the object, and may move in the direction of SCP-345. Several objects behaved normally before being near the object; however, when they were approximately one meter away from it, they began to move very quickly in a random direction until they collided with another object or left the area altogether. In one case, an object that was originally placed in a horizontal position was observed to move vertically for several seconds before moving horizontally again."]</p>
