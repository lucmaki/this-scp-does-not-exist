<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-474</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The mouth of SCP-474 is to be covered with a sheet of opaque plastic (1Â mm in thickness) whenever it is not currently contained. Any personnel who observe SCP-474 must wear mirrored sunglasses and sunglasses with a tinted lens, and must not view the object directly through the cameras mounted on their helmets or goggles/glasses/etc.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-474 is a hydra with a mouth that stretches down to the bottom of the river, but does not extend more than eight meters from the actual riverbed. The mouth stretches 20 meters down the river, and has been observed to be at least seven meters wide by some eyewitnesses.</p><p>During times when SCP-474 is not contained, it will attempt to retract its mouth back to its normal location. This causes its head to rapidly shrink in size and cause a very large tidal wave in the process, as well as causing an even larger pull on the riverbed. This can have disastrous effects on nearby vessels. In addition, during its extended period of activity, SCP-474 will occasionally shoot long tendrils of saliva out of its mouth at other objects or persons within range of its mouth; this is believed to be a failed attempt at grappling them with its teeth and snapping them up into its mouth in a manner similar to that which occurs with animals that try to eat each other (referred to as "predation"). If any person comes within range of this saliva for more than 15 seconds, they will begin swallowing it and will continue to do so until their body mass exceeds 5% of their original body mass; due to the force from SCP-474's consumption of the saliva itself, they may suffer internal injuries while being swallowed. Victims have noted that this process can take anywhere between a few days and years depending on their initial body mass.</p><p>Attempts at capturing SCP-474 have been unsuccessful due to its ability to regenerate heads or quickly move away from any area under observation. In addition, attempts made in boats or helicopters will also produce unusual tides which pull both boat or helicopter into the depths of SCP-474's stomach.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> After the creation of this SCP, a large number of eyewitnesses have reported the appearance of multiple small mouths around SCP-474's mouth, which will appear and disappear at varying intervals. These mouths are believed to be the original specimens of SCP-474-1 (designated SCP-474-1a and -1b) that were lost when it regrew its head."]</p>
