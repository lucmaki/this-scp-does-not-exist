<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-741</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter-T</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-741 is to be kept in a containment chamber measuring 1,000 square m at Site-46, located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (USA) in a mineral deposit known as [DATA EXPUNGED]. There are to be no less than three armed guards at all times outside the chamber, which is to be under 24 hour surveillance. The location of the chamber has been informed to no less than five government agencies and passed on numerous times. The facility itself is to be guarded by Foundation personnel who will terminate any persons attempting to get inside or undermine containment procedures.</p><p>No fewer than three oral reports detailing SCP-741's properties have been made: one to the Department of Justice, one to the American Geological Survey, and one to the National Academy of Sciences. Interceptions of these reports are to be made with the intent of revealing no less than five large anomalous "mysteries" which require further study, listed below, in order for them not to make any potentially dangerous breaches into public consciousness.</p><p>On █/██/2014, SCP-741's containment chamber was found buried underground by a group of civilians. When removed from its vault, it behaved normally for several hours before it began levitating and emitting radiation. A Foundation investigation revealed that [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-741 is a human male, aged 29 at time of sequestration, standing 1.7 meters and weighing roughly 60 kg. It is thought to be the result of genetic engineering, or at least the closest match to a human that has ever been created through genetic engineering. SCP-741 possesses no internal organs, and is completely embedded in a smooth block of marble made from ████ ████████ (a rare type of granite found only in the Sierra Nevada Mountains). Despite attempts to pierce it and remove it using conventional methods, all attempts have failed. DNA testing suggests that SCP-741's body is composed entirely of ████████.</p><p>SCP-741's anomalous properties become apparent when certain auditory objects are played within its proximity. At this point, no two observers will report on precisely the same auditory output:</p><p>Discovery: SCP-741 was discovered after a large number of reports were made concerning "anomalous activity" around [DATA EXPUNGED]. As such, the extent of SCP-741's anomalous effects were not known until its removal from its vault and the subsequent activation thereof.</p>
