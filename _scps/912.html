<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-912</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-912 is to be maintained in a standard forestry isolation site. An isolation cage is to be erected around SCP-912 and sealed with an automatic locking mechanism, accessed through a secure airlock which requires access code and clearance from both the Site Director and the Site Head of Forests.</p><p>SCP-912's enclosure is to be monitored for unauthorized entry by security personnel or unauthorized loss of containment. In the event of an unauthorized loss of containment, or at any other point where SCP-912's containment fails, an armed rescue team is to intervene and reclaim SCP-912; any loss of human life during this operation is to result in demotion or termination.</p><p>Should SCP-912 suffer substantial injuries, it is to be placed in partial hibernation until healing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-912 is a member of the yellow birch (Betula papyrifera), a species native to the northern regions of North America. SCP-912's appearance and physiology are normal for its species; its anomalous properties manifest only when it is portrayed in visual media, particularly the style popularized by Walt Disney Studios during the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p>When rendered in this fashion, SCP-912 assumes a shape that is consistent with the depiction of another entity, up to and including specific anatomical details (such as fingerprints). The specifics of how SCP-912 transforms into these shapes varies from medium to medium, but all result in varying degrees of realism.</p><p>While transformed, SCP-912 is animate and capable of speech, and enters an altered state of consciousness. The nature of this altered state varies across depictions. In most instances, SCP-912's mannerisms and consciousness resemble those associated with other entities that appear in said media; however, there have been reports of SCP-912 exhibiting erratic behaviors indicative of schizophrenia or dementia similar to those seen in real life persons suffering from such conditions. In some cases, SCP-912 displays proficiency with various physical skills and acumen; while seemingly unable to follow complex instructions or basic patterns, it nonetheless demonstrates remarkable proficiency at card tricks such as "The Giantess" (see Addendum 912-A), sleight of hand such as bending a coin or tying a knot (see Addendum 912-B), and other tasks requiring unusual dexterity or knowledge — to date no employee at Containment Site 19 has been able to match SCP-912's skill at solving difficult puzzles designed to test reasoning and problem solving ability.</p><p>All sightings have been taken as proof that whoever or whatever played the part of the lead actor on screen possesses similar abilities; henceforth all recordings featuring more than one person portraying SCP-912 were designated under separate Class E research directives as "Kildeer".</p><p>Recovery: SCP-912 was discovered after an anomalous death occurred at ████ Correctional Institution in ██████████, Wisconsin. An MTF units was deployed to investigate after several individuals affiliated with the prison staff reported sightings of a child near their barracks in a blue, tattered outfit bearing numerous stains including blood. All communications with the investigation team were lost after around 2 hours; initial attempts by local authorities to track down the source of the transmissions failed due to interference by radio towers and long distance jamming operations conducted by a covert organization referred to as "X".</p><p>Upon arriving at Isolation Cell B3 and examining CCTV footage depicting what appeared to be an adult male wearing a blue jumpsuit identical to those worn by both regular guards and those serving supervisory positions throughout Site 19, it was determined that within hours after arrival, SCP-912 had already assumed control over several staff members who served as guard duty at Kivler Hall — including Agent Michaels who died during this transition. After exiting Kivler Hall carrying two severed human limbs belonging to Agent Michaels strapped across his back and moving through security gate seven dummies dressed in civilian clothes rigged with explosives were set up outside; despite these preparations being made 5 hours before discovery by guards attempting to apprehend him, none were detonated when either investigating teams opened fire on them — resulting in extensive damage but no loss of life.</p><p>SCP-912 was then observed attacking security personnel stationed outside Kivler hall using knives he had carved from wood while portraying several different individuals wearing red coats — most notably Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832–1898), better known under his pen name Lewis Carroll. During this time period he was also witnessed wielding his bare hands or inflicting injuries using staff weapons; however, at least one staff member reported that Dr. ████████ had also been present during this time period, wielding ██████'s grandfather's bowie knife while claiming to be [REDACTED]. Following a brief struggle which resulted in [REDACTED], three bullets were discharged from Agent ████████'s service pistol which killed [REDACTED]; upon examination, the gun revealed its bullets had been removed prior to their discharge — all firing mechanisms missing except for one empty cartridge case ejected from the weapon before use. Attempts by Foundation drones dispatched from Containment Site 19 which emplaced explosive charges around SCP-912's cell failed when they detonated too close to him; attempts where tests placed further away proved successful.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 912-A:</strong> A series of tests have been performed to determine the mental capabilities of SCP-912, testing his ability to perform simple tasks such as matching symbols and letters with their written counterparts, identifying photographs and matching them with names, and other tasks that require little or no thinking. These tests have also been performed on any Kildeer who assume human form; despite all humans being able to pass these tests, they are not able to match the performance of SCP-912 when in human form.']</p>
