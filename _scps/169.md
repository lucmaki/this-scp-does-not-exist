<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-169</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-169 is to be constructed in a secure containment unit on Site-23. Researchers are to be provided with designated areas of the testing chamber where they may play with SCP-169.</p><p>Testing may only take place under direct supervision by Site-23 researchers. Play sessions are to last no more than twelve (12) hours at a time. Before each play session, researchers will be required to manually shut down any previously active instances of SCP-169 from their inventory. Any suspected unauthorized use of SCP-169 is to be reported immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-169 is an Ikea table, with a chromed metal base and no legs. When activated, SCP-169 will cause human subjects (hereafter referred to as "subjects" for the duration of testing) to experience vivid and unique hallucinations for periods lasting between two (2) and twelve (12) hours. All subjects report that the hallucinations are surprisingly realistic despite their surreal nature.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 169-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, an individual named Wayne ████████████ entered SCP-169 containment chamber and activated SCP-169. This caused the previously inactive instance of SCP-169 to become active and send repeated text messages to Mr. ████████████'s mobile device. After the messages ceased, SCP-169 became inactive again until it was manually shut down by Site-23 researchers. SCP-169 was then deactivated and stored in its current containment unit."]</p>
