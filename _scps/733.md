<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-733</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-733 is currently held in a standard containment locker, under guard by five (5) security personnel. No personnel are allowed to remove SCP-733 from its containment area without explicit approval from at least one senior member of the SCP-733 team.</p><p>SCP-733 may be used for testing purposes for no longer than 15 days at a time, with a written review by the current project leader before renewal. All materials related to the testing of SCP-733 require approval by the project leader and documentation of their use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-733 is a set of blindingly bright red sunglasses. SCP-733 does not appear to have any sort of camera built into it, as no recording has been found. SCP-733 does not record any images, and does not appear to be equipped to do so in any way. SCP-733's only function seems to be the delivery of small amounts of solar energy from an unknown source.</p><p>SCP-733 is capable of emitting this energy at a rate comparable to that of a typical pair of sunglasses, although with the brightness of the lenses being about 10 times what would be expected for a standard pair of sunglasses. In addition, SCP-733 can beam solar energy directly into the eye of whoever wears them, which is then absorbed and converted into electricity, providing night vision equivalent to that provided by Class 3 Night Vision Goggles unless otherwise noted. This effect remains constant with no deviation that is recorded.</p><p>When using SCP-733's abilities, one will notice they are unable to use basic hand motions normally used while wearing regular glasses; such as looking down at one's watch or making gestures like one would do when wearing a pair of shades.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On 05/13/19, testing with SCP-733 ended without incident. However, during testing on 05/21/19, Doctor ██████ suffered a severe eye injury while using SCP-733's abilities. Doctor ██████ was taken to the medical wing of Site-██. After being treated and given amnestics, Doctor ██████ was returned to active duty.</p><p>On 05/24/19, Doctor ██████ reported an acute onset of vertigo while wearing SCP-733. Doctor ██████ stated that he experienced a brief dizziness and nausea while using SCP-733's capabilities. Upon investigation, Doctor ██████ had developed a tumor in his right eye which was found to have grown to approximately 1cm in diameter and 2mm in depth.</p><p>After a period of recovery and observation, it was discovered that Doctor ██████'s tumor had been growing at an accelerated rate since being injured. After 48 hours following the incident, the tumor had grown to approximately 6cm in diameter and 8mm in depth.</p><p>By 06/02/19, Doctor ██████'s tumor had grown to approximately 10cm in diameter and 12mm in depth.</p><p>On 06/07/19, Dr. ██████ requested that his duties be transferred to a non-contacting position. After consultation with the project leader, this request was granted.</p><p>On 06/08/19, Dr. ██████ requested his resignation as a member of the SCP-733 team."]</p>
