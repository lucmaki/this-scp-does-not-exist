<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-865</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-865 is kept in a standard containment locker, located at Site-██. It is to be monitored for any signs of movements or damage, at all times.</p><p>Any personnel involved in the maintenance of SCP-865 are to be wearing protective eyewear while they are nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-865 is a storage locker located in an abandoned police station that can only be accessed through a fire escape. Its interior, which resembles that of a typical dentist office, contains approximately 1.3 containers of various teeth and bones inside of it.</p><p>SCP-865 was found in the possession of Hannah ███████, who was arrested three weeks prior to this incident due to the discovery of several human remains in her apartment. According to information available, Ms. ███████ was frequently seeing a therapist, resulting in SCP-865's discovery by the police. She had been using the items in SCP-865 as part of a makeshift magic circle of sorts. The items were later confiscated due to their suspicious and unusual nature.</p><p>During a containment breach on █/█/20██, security footage revealed that Ms. ███████ constantly checked the items of SCP-865 throughout the night prior to the incident. It is also notable that she would periodically open and close SCP-865 for unknown reasons. During this time, several human body parts began appearing from within its interior; however, after Ms. ███████ entered her bedroom, these body parts would vanish from sight. The police soon entered her room after several complaints about her unkempt living conditions, but were unable to find any evidence regarding any missing body parts or other abnormalities, according to the reports filed by local authorities.</p><p>However, after determining that Ms. ███████ had killed herself with her own handgun following this incident and that her case had been closed, investigators found no record of such incidents occurring at all.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 865-1:</strong> After the discovery of SCP-865, one of its items, an old human tooth, was sent to the Department of Pathology for testing. The results showed that the tooth was capable of producing and manipulating a copy of its own material, which contained several microscopic holes. These could be used to store any item within the cavity of the tooth. Testing on a variety of other teeth and bones has shown that this property is a common trait among such items.</p><p>The following information is currently under investigation.</p>
