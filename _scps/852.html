<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-852</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-852 instances are to be contained in Containment Unit-852 at Site-77. SCP-852 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with the addition of a wooden bedframe, a large table and three chairs, and a shelving unit lined with books of varying subjects.</p><p>The chamber is to be filled with standardized quantities of soft furnishings and art objects sufficient to create a pleasant environment. Any changes to this location or furniture are to be documented in order to be stored as part of SCP-852's containment procedures.</p><p>A poster reading "General A. Gordon" is affixed to the ceiling of the containment chamber. This poster must not be removed from the chamber for any reason, nor can it be altered in any way. The poster does not need to be visible for containment purposes, but its position within the chamber is significant. These decisions will be made by O Council personnel upon evaluation of what risks are present and which risks have been mitigated through planned actions.</p><p>All staff assigned to work with SCP-852 must maintain cover stories that protect their colleagues from knowing their true affiliation with the Foundation. At no time will staff working with SCP-852 mention their involvement with the Foundation; if they do so, they will not recover employment within the Foundation. If a member of protocol staff wishes to ask about any details regarding SCP-852 or Containment Unit 852, they must make a written request (with all personal information redacted) to one of the following individuals: Dr. Orens, Dr. Manheim, Dr. Hopper, or Dr. Greening. Staff may not discuss SCP-852 outside of these approved channels and must avoid mentioning the Foundation unless ordered by an O Council member or security clearance permitting access has been obtained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-852 is a humanoid entity, approximately 2.08 meters tall, who exists within the confines of Containment Unit-852 at Site-77. SCP-852 has been observed to wear clothing of the military uniform worn by George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Abingdon (1762–1850), although the coloration and specifics of these uniforms have been inconsistent with these records. SCP-852 is fully ambulatory, capable of walking at speeds of up to 20 km/h on level ground and 5 km/h over uneven terrain.</p><p>SCP-852 exhibits anomalous behavior in a number of areas, such as displaying aggression towards any other personnel interacting with it, presenting no evidence of advanced aging or degradation over time, and expressing fears or hatreds never documented before. Even more problematic are the contradictory responses SCP-852 has given regarding its name and origins. When asked if it has a name by personnel working within Containment Unit-852, SCP-852 will usually reply that it merely goes by Gordon, then follow up with "as I said in the beginning" when this response is not satisfactory to interrogators. SCP-852 will only respond to its true name when handled outside unit 852.</p><p>Should an individual speak out loud against SCP-852's behavior or characteristics (such as referring to it by its true name), it will immediately become hostile toward them and attempt to injure them, even after SCP-852 is removed from the vicinity where it interacted with this individual. This aggressive state does not impair SCP-852's ability to speak aloud or interact with other individuals beyond normal limits; however, this behavior makes any attempts at socialization extremely hazardous to staff working within Containment Unit 852 and should be avoided whenever possible.</p><p>SCP-852's interactions are highly complex. It displays several difficulties in maintaining adequate coordination while under pressure, but only in one area: interacting verbally with other individuals through written language. SCP-852 can create written communications long enough to be understood by humans, but these texts are highly irregular in their grammar and syntax, have poor grammar and spelling (for instance: "We're still here" is frequently written as "We're still kimossing" or "we're still kimosezing", despite clear examples that show it has learned the correct forms of speech), often contradict itself (such as "We're still here," "So we're still here," and "I'm not sure how."), and will often repeat statements just a few seconds after being spoken aloud (a consistent theme is that most statements are more forceful than necessary). This behavior does not appear to cause impairment for SCP-852 like verbal interaction does for other humans since there is no evidence that this affect causes physical damage or reduces cognitive function beyond normal levels; however, this habit has caused significant stress on staff interacting with SCP-852 because many believe that this habit indicates their life is somehow threatened or held hostage by the entity they are required to interact with daily.</p><p>In addition to its tendency toward verbal communication through written form, SCP-852 seems fascinated by abstract concepts such as mathematics and science; however, it is impossible for personnel assigned to work with SCP-852 to determine whether descriptions or images presented by SCP-852 originate from its own perception of reality or if they are taken directly from printed material stored within Containment Unit 852 (including scientific books kept within containment units). Research into these subjects is ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 852-A:</strong> SCP-852 has been observed to generate a small pile of books and art objects on the small table within its containment chamber, which it will accumulate over time. It will consistently rotate these items through the space between its bed and the shelving unit. It appears to claim ownership of some of these items, such as a copy of the Necronomicon and a print of "The Scream" by Edvard Munch.</p><p>SCP-852 was first discovered in North Carolina in ██/██/19██, when Foundation agents in charge of tracking down several anomalous entities were called to investigate reports of an escaped humanoid. When asked about its name and origin, SCP-852 replied that it would go by Gordon until it was no longer confined or until it "made progress." The Foundation began containment following this response and SCP-852 was placed in Containment Unit 852 at Site-77.']</p>
