<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-968</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-968 is to be housed in a standard containment locker at Site-██. SCP-968 may be used only by Level 3 personnel or those with Level 2 (unrestricted) clearance. SCP-968 is not to be handled by Level 1 personnel unless they are under supervision of a Level 3 or higher supervisor, and even then it must be handled carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-968 is a human rights textbook, titled The Rights We Wish We Had. It is an English translation of "Il diritti che ci manca", an Italian book written by Ezio Mendez and published in the year ████. SCP-968 was recovered in an apartment located in ████████, Italy on 11/██/██, along with four other books on human rights. These books are now presumed to have been forgeries, and instead belong to the Foundation. SCP-968 has not been found in any other records or documents and its origins are unknown.</p><p>SCP-968 contains information on hundreds of different rights outlined in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other sources. However, the information contained within SCP-968 does not coincide with the UDHR at all, and the text within SCP-968 does not follow any known logic.</p><p>SCP-968 is written in English using standard legal terms and abbreviations, but it lacks any form of punctuation or grammar rules. The text within SCP-968 is also unrelated to any specific concept mentioned in the UDHR or any other related texts. SCP-968 makes references to things that were not even created until after the UDHR was signed, such as voting rights and human rights organizations. It also mentions concepts that are never mentioned specifically by the UDHR, such as [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED]</p><p>SCP-968 contains over 200 pages of text; the first page displays a picture of a plowman carrying a scythe behind him, while the last page ends with a blank space to be filled out by the reader. The middle of each page between these two is covered with several paragraphs of text which change from time to time. This content seems to be completely random; researchers have had difficulty determining what to study ahead of time. Nobody has had access to read a full page without one of these paragraphs appearing first.</p>
