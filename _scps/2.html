<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-2 are to be kept in a cell with reinforced concrete walls, powered lighting and flood-proof plumbing systems. Instances are to be fed through a narrow tube inserted directly into their anus.</p><p>At the beginning of each week, an on-site lab staff member will feed one instance of SCP-2 through the tube for two hours. During this time, an audio/visual recording device is to monitor the instance's vocalizations for any SCP-2 instances in distress. Any instance which makes a distress call or which does not make a physical response within 10 minutes is to be fed through the tube immediately. Instances not responding within five minutes after being placed in the cell must be administered Class-A amnestics.</p><p>Within 10 minutes of feeding an instance through the tube, a security detail is to retrieve it and continue feeding until the end of the week. If any instance remains unresponsive at close to the end of the week, it is to be refined through its anus and rendered harmless to emergency personnel as required under AR 71-23 "Emergency Procedures for Containment of Anomalous Objects".</p><p>If any portion of a specimen of SCP-2 remains with an intact brain, or continues to function in any manner other than as an anorectal pump, then it is to be taken alive by Site personnel. All data collected on specimens is to be erased and destroyed</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2 is a species of arthropodal, necrotrophic parasite capable of living indefinitely within the human intestine. It possesses most organs and functions seen in other terrestrial arthropods, with the exception of a large circular bulge on its underside near the anus.</p><p>SCP-2 has three known stages of biological development: egg, larva, and adult. Instances of SCP-2 hatch from their eggs after approximately two weeks. The juvenile stage lasts approximately two months before they are ready to enter the adult stage.</p><p>During the adult stage, SCP-2 will consume bodily fluids through the anus, excreting intestinal waste as food for itself. SCP-2 will die when all of its energy has been exhausted.</p><p>SCP-2 instances are insectoid in nature and have elongated claws which enable them to burrow into a person's rectum; however, SCP-2 is incapable of crawling or walking along the shell membrane lining the human gastrointestinal tract. As such, SCP-2 uses its claws to move along the lining of the small intestines.</p><p>SCP-2 is capable of reproducing at a rate of one per week, which usually occurs during mid-sleep; however, SCP-2 can reproduce quickly if necessary through any means that allows it to penetrate a human anus with its elongated claws.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 2:</strong> SCP-2 Instances</p><p>SCP-2 was discovered in the spring of 1976 in ██████, ██, when a meteorite fell into a field and landed on a farmer, who subsequently died from peritonitis two days later. The farmer\'s son reported that his father was "making funny noises at night" and "didn\'t know what he was doing".</p><p>The family doctor, who was close friends with the family, had actually been observing SCP-2 for a month using a small video camera; however, he did not recognize it as an anomaly until the instance had produced its first child. The doctor believed that the organism was a parasite and simply removed it from the rectum. No further instances were discovered for several weeks, until the mother began to produce more instances. The doctor then revealed his findings to the local authorities.']</p>
