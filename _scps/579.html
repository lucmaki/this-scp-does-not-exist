<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-579</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> An enclosed honeycomb located in a secluded location has been constructed to house SCP-579.</p><p>SCP-579-1 is to be contained in a plastic box measuring 10 × 20 × 40 centimeters and filled with any available material, such as wood shavings or shredded paper. The specimen must have at least six square centimeter of space between its wings, legs, and body.</p><p>All insects removed from SCP-579 are to be placed in the enclosed honeycomb which has been fitted with air vents and a fan. Insects may only enter through the ventilation ducts.</p><p>Due to the potential for damage to the specimens and their surrounding environment, all personnel who come into contact with SCP-579 must undergo a thorough medical exam before being permitted access to the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-579 is a glass jar containing several artificial bees (Buprestidae). SCP-579 was recovered from the storage area of the [REDACTED] Museum in █████████, ██████ on 14/01/19██.</p><p>SCP-579's anomalous properties manifest when any insect within its range attempts to fly out of the specimen and becomes trapped. The longer it remains trapped within SCP-579, the stronger and more complex the traps it will construct. Thus, it is imperative that all specimens remain contained at all times.</p><p>SCP-579 appears to have been used as a containment device for various insects which were later removed, including:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
