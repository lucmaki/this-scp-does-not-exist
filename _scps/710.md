<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-710</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A large fence has been built around the property of SCP-710, with a three meter thick steel security gate on the exterior and one meter thick concrete on the interior. A CCTV system has been installed in order to monitor SCP-710, and no unauthorized persons are to enter the area under any circumstances. Any civilians attempting to gain access to SCP-710 outside of approved testing must be brought to the armed guard at Site-19 for questioning. All requests for access to SCP-710 must be approved by at least two personnel with Level 3 clearance.</p><p>A guard is required at all times ten meters away from SCP-710, armed with standard service sidearms as well as tranquilizer ammunition and mace in the event of hostile beings or objects attacking others. If an order is given to attack another human being, all guards are authorized to use lethal force. Additional guards are assigned on a rotating basis, with a minimum of four individuals present at all times.</p><p>Due to the inherent danger of this object, all tests on it are to be overseen by at least three personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher. Personnel who have met with a near-fatal injury while testing SCP-710 have been reassigned from testing duties; however, they are offered mental and physical support as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-710 is a Ford F150 pickup truck owned by Mr. ███████, located at 96 Brightview Road in the small town of ████████, ███████. The vehicle is confirmed to have been converted into a mobile containment unit with the addition of electronic security measures and several modifications. Despite being capable of driving and functioning as a car, an anomalous effect has prevented this from happening; however, several tests have shown that if an object or person is placed in the vehicle, they will be transported along with SCP-710.</p><p>SCP-710 will transport any living human being who is not in direct physical contact with it at a set speed of 25 miles per hour. No passengers will be harmed in any way by SCP-710's transportation properties unless they manage to enter the vehicle during the transportation process. Additionally, SCP-710 does not possess any anomalous properties when transporting objects other than people; however, it must maintain contact with one of its occupants to do so. As such, all persons in SCP-710 are constantly aware of their surroundings and able to see through the eyes of their passenger as if they were the passenger themselves.</p><p>SCP-710 only transports beings positioned on or close to their bodies at the instant of initial exposure. There seems to be no effect on organisms or objects larger than humans, but moving through objects at high speeds can cause harm or discomfort if not handled appropriately. Any object which makes contact with SCP-710 while it is transporting another being will also be transported along with them: however, humans have demonstrated volition over whether or not they are transported; as such, previous testing may have resulted in more than one instance of SCP-710 traveling outside its intended destination due to objects being accidentally transported along with a subject.</p><p>Destinations are usually chosen by the occupant through telepathy (see Test Log 1). Subjects will usually choose destinations that involve visiting places they cannot visit normally due to time constraints, moral objections or geographical restrictions like ocean depths or inhospitable climate zones. Test subjects seem to consistently prefer sites within their home state or country for these trips (see Test Logs 2 and 3); however, travel to distant locations involving possible hostile entities has been observed under controlled conditions (see Test Log 4).</p><p>All known methods for retrieval of individuals from SCP-710 involve a significant amount of time spent in transit. Previous attempts have been made using various methods as well as disguises, but typically take months or even years before results begin to present themselves. All success rates reported thus far have been less than 50% successful. Test subjects have become disoriented after teleportation and some subjects have reported feeling separated from their body: however, all subjects are eventually able to complete tasks requiring concentration upon arrival at their destination without aid from others who were part of the episode.</p><p>The Foundation made contact with Mr. ███████ after receiving several "abductions" by Foundation agents working undercover among his neighbors who claimed that he was "doing experiments" involving cars for his own amusement. Through research performed by MTF Alpha-Niner (see Document 1), it was verified that Mr. ███████ did perform mock experiments on automobiles for entertainment purposes but was unaware of having actual anomalous abilities until after moving into his current home in ██████ County where he met up with Agent ██████ and Agent █████████ while they were investigating the murder of several civilians nearby.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum: Test Log 1:</strong></p><p>Agent ██████████: Can you tell me what happened?</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Yes, I can.</p><p>[Subject is not in a position where he could see the others in the room; therefore, it is assumed that he can only hear their voices.]</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> The man in the back of the truck. He grabbed my shoulder and started to pull me towards the car.</p><p>[Agent ██████████ looks for a body in the back of SCP-710 without success.]</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> He pulled so hard. I fell in the seat, and then he was pulling me again. I looked out of the window and saw him standing on the hood of the car.</p><p>[Agent ██████████ measures the distance from the subject's seat to the ground without finding an appropriate support beam.]</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> He was stabbing at the air with his hands, screaming something at me. I just stared at him, shaking my head and trying to keep myself from falling out of the truck bed. It felt like I was falling, but I'm still here. He must have just been angry. He let go of my arm and stomped away from me.</p><p>[Subject is not in a position where he could see the others in the room; therefore, it is assumed that he can only hear their voices.]</p><p><strong>Agent ██████████:</strong> That's fascinating. You were able to tell us what was happening despite being unable to see anything? How did you decide on your destination when you got here?</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> I don't know. I just thought about what would be fun to do if I were home, and it came to mind. There's this park we go to sometimes… It's really pretty when they turn it into a holiday display. I'd definitely like to go there sometime soon.</p><p>[Subject is not in a position where he could see the others in the room; therefore, it is assumed that he can only hear their voices.]</p><p><strong>Agent ██████████:</strong> Does this mean that you could control where you went when you entered SCP-710?</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Yeah, sorta. When I got inside, it was dark and cold. I thought about what we did when we went there together last time, and it made me feel better. We got out of there right after that, but this time we stayed for a little longer and talked about how nice everything was.</p><p>[Agent ██████████ attempts to retrieve subject from SCP-710 without success.]</p><p><strong>Agent ██████████:</strong> Alright then, thank you for your cooperation. We'll be around if you need anything else, okay?</p><p>[Subject does not appear within a suitable location for retrieval until 2 hours and 32 minutes later; however, Agent ██████████ attempts to retrieve him from SCP-710 with no success afterwards.]"]</p>
