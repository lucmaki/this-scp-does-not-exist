<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-361</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-361 is to be kept in a stainless steel locker at Site-77. Access is restricted to site security personnel with Level 4 clearance and above and a minimum of four (4) years of Supervisory experience. No more than two (2) units may be on hand at any time, and all personnel working with SCP-361 must have been trained in the anomalous effects of SCP-361.</p><p>The containers used for SCP-361 are to be inspected every two hours for possible damage or tampering. All such damage or tampering is to be noted and recorded, and SCP-361 is to be replaced immediately. If SCP-361 should lose its anomalous properties due to breach of containment, an expendable special agent is to deploy the replacement unit into restricted storage before the lost ones can be noticed by non-anomalous personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-361 appears to be a forty-seven (47) inch chef's knife with a wooden handle. The blade is stainless steel and measures approximately one (1) inch in width. When held by an experienced user, SCP-361 can affect the knife's physical properties, causing it to cut as if it were made of a different material.</p><p>The effects of SCP-361 appear only in its vicinity when wielded by an experienced user and only for tasks within a competently performed kitchen. Experienced chefs who use SCP-361 claim that using SCP-361 makes them more efficient in the kitchen.</p><p>When used properly, SCP- 361 is capable of cutting through most ordinary materials with apparent ease, including common vegetables, fruits, meats and cheeses. The outer layer of foods being cut instantly detaches from the rest and appears to dissolve away into air. All matter cut in this manner is sentient, though not sapient. As such, these materials will not willingly come into contact with any living beings except those who perform kitchen tasks regularly and are therefore familiar with the anomalous properties of SCP- 361 .</p><p>However, non-human sapients viewing samples of this food would disagree emphatically: they report the sense of cold that accompanies it and will refuse to eat it unless they are given regular doses of strengthening medicine intended to slow down their metabolism. Eating food from SCP-361 will cause violent gastric distress; therefore all personnel who use SCP-361 must have preternaturally strong stomachs and have been instructed on what to expect in the event that it should get loose from its container.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
