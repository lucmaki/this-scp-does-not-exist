<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6 is to be stored in a standard containment locker located at Site-09.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6 is a 1959 Ford Sunbeam with a collapsible rear axle and outboard seal. SCP-6's front end and headlights are missing, but SCP-6 functions perfectly otherwise.</p><p>SCP-6 smells of liquid nitrogen with traces of ozone. The odor appears to function as a "homing device" for SCP-6, attempting to find other objects containing the same chemicals. SCP-6 will autonomously move towards any container that contains the same chemicals.</p><p>Samples of SCP-6's gas can be produced through suitable methods (video demonstration provided in addendum).</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-6 was recovered from a ████ ███████ chemical company warehouse in ███████, Tennessee. The owner of the building, █████ ██████, was found dead with several ligature marks on his neck. The warehouse was completely filled with various containers and cylinders of the same gas.</p><p>The only contents of the containers were unlabeled plastic bags containing the same odor as SCP-6.</p><p>When tested, all samples produced by SCP-6 will instantly ignite in flames upon contact with air.']</p>
