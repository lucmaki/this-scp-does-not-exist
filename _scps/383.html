<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-383</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-383 is currently contained in a specially designed humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-383 requires a temperature of between 30 and 40 °C to remain active, and thus is to be housed at this temperature when in containment. SCP-383's containment chamber is raised off the ground with a large pool of water underneath; due to the size of SCP-383's body, it requires several inches of water for survival. The chamber is lined with lead sheets to prevent accidental liquid contact with SCP-383.</p><p>SCP-383 has been observed to swim in excess of ten meters before resting; this pool is monitored by remote cameras. Telemetry indicates that SCP-383 will swim until the excess energy is depleted, at which point it will lie on its side and allow the excess water to drain into the pool, then repeat the cycle once more. As no classified research has provided any insight into how SCP-383 achieves this effect, it has been theorized that it draws water into cells in its body in order to create buoyancy, then expels the water to counteract gravity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-383 is a human male, measuring 1.8 m (approximately 6'2") in height and weighing 70kg (approximately 154 pounds). It possesses no discernible limbs or organs as of yet; however, it seems to be able to move all of its bodily tissues, including the water that encases it. SCP-383's outer membrane (which is approximately 5m in length) appears drier than most other similar organisms; this is believed to be an adaptation to alter the rate at which water can enter and exit the body.</p><p>SCP-383's tissue appears waterproof, but is subject to rupturing if the body experiences too much pressure or friction. SCP-383 has been observed applying various substances to it in order to seal wounds; barbed copper spikes are pulled from SCP-383's body and embedded into whatever area SCP-383 needs to repair. If a wound is large enough, SCP-383 will either grow larger segments of skin or apply more glue in order to replace the damaged portions of its outer membrane. SCP-383's red blood cells appear to be nonhumanoid in nature and do not move through the plasma of its body; instead, they appear to travel through the capillaries within its tissue.</p><p>SCP-383 is able to expel any foreign liquids it may have come into contact with. This process occurs immediately upon contact with liquid, causing a vacuum effect; however, extremely large amounts of water are unable to be expelled at once, particularly if the excess liquid has entered organs such as kidneys or liver. SCP-383 appears incapable of breathing on its own; instead, it uses samples of air inhaled by other organisms as well as wind turbines installed by Foundation personnel.</p><p>SCP-383 was first discovered after a hotel manager reported smelling mildew in his bathroom during business hours and finding a maintenance worker sleeping in his shower while they were open; after testing revealed no traces of mold or fungus present in the room, both employees were designated Class A amnestics shortly thereafter.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Testing Logs</p><p><strong>Testing Logs:</strong></p><p>Date: ██/██/████</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> To determine the maximum amount of water SCP-383 can expel at once.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong></p><p>Subject: SCP-383</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was restrained by security staff and then submerged in a large pool of water.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-383 expelled approximately 3,000 pounds of water in the course of five minutes; the excess water was evenly distributed throughout the room, causing damage to several items.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> I would like to try again with less water.</p><p><strong>Security Officer ████████:</strong> Let's try with just a few pints this time.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-383</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was restrained by security staff and then submerged in a small pool of water.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-383 expelled approximately 500 pounds of water in less than a minute; the excess water was evenly distributed throughout the room, causing damage to several items.</p><p><strong>Security Officer ████████:</strong> We'll try that again with more water, but no more than an inch deep.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-383</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was restrained by security staff and then submerged in a pool of water approximately two meters deep.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-383 expended approximately 4,000 pounds of water in the span of five minutes; the excess water caused severe damage to the containment chamber, as well as causing severe pain and damage to both security officers. Both officers were removed from the chamber immediately after testing was concluded and administered Class B amnestics to prevent them from remembering the incident.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> I would like to see this again, but this time with less pressure and less water. I have a feeling we're going to need to do this a few more times if we want to find out what exactly is going on here.</p>
