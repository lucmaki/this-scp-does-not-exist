<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-557</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-557 is to be kept in a climate-controlled storage case when not in use. Exposure of external SCP-557-1 to direct sunlight is to be avoided, and its location must be kept a secret from all Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-557 is a copy of The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. When it is exposed to direct sunlight, SCP-557 will mutate into a new object resembling any printed text that was printed in its place. If no printed text has existed recently, an endless number of printed texts will be created until the paper is destroyed. Once modified, SCP-557 will not revert back to its original form unless repeatedly submerged in water or shadowed by an opaque surface.</p><p>SCP-557 was recovered from the offices of philately-mania Foundation front company "The Hetrus" on 5/17/1954, following the disappearance of approximately ██ "Hetrus"-branded stamps from postal systems throughout Europe, Asia, Australia and North America.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On 12/04/1954, SCP-557-1 was collected from a post office in ██████, Indiana. The following message was found attached to it:</p><p>To whom it may concern,</p><p>I hereby present our latest creation, which will easily win the annual Oscar for best picture book of the year. It's about a boy who goes on vacation and gets lost. Don't worry, though — he ends up finding his way home again.</p><p>— Dr. ███"]</p>
