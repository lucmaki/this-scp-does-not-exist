<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-784</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-784 is to be kept in a Faraday cage located in Site-84's Environmental Chamber C. The enclosure is to be checked daily for any signs of corrosion or deterioration, and cleaned with a mild detergent solution at least once per week. Any damage to the enclosure will be replaced at no cost with Foundation maintenance personnel. SCP-784 is not to be transported by air or rail while under containment.</p><p>Thirty titanium rings (see Addendum) are to be placed around SCP-784's display surface to prevent anyone from attempting to remove it. These are to be replaced as needed for seamless operation and should be emptied occasionally for maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-784 is a computer graphic video adapter manufactured by Commodore International in 1986. The device loads the file "PALETTE.PRG" from the user's floppy disk drive onto a computer monitor's display surface. When this file is loaded, it displays layers and patterns of colored dots on the display, in a 3D configuration.</p><p>If any two dots of the same color within this 3D representation are placed exactly one meter apart (see Experiment Logs 784-A through -F), two 2-meter long lines of cyan or green will be formed along their outer edges. If no dots corresponding to the same color are within 1 meter of each other, no lines will be formed; however, the pattern will still appear on the screen and will change as the viewer moves around. These lines can also be made to appear when all dots of a single color fall within a specified area.</p><p>This demonstration program was written before vector graphics were introduced into home computers; therefore, it does not display vector graphics. The program was originally able to draw more complex patterns, but these have been lost when SCP-784 was taken from its original owner due to improper storage (see Addendum).</p><p>SCP-784 provides an accurate recreation of its surroundings even if there are obstacles between it and its target monitor's display surface, or if they are too large to fit entirely inside SCP-784's enclosure. However, SCP-784 cannot produce anything that is not either a line or a dot in some form. It can produce (and has produced) images of all shapes and sizes, as well as depictions of organisms and geometric shapes, but these have only matched those seen previously in similar demonstrations and have not been capable of expanding on them for an extended time period.</p><p>If more than 30 titanium rings (see Addendum) are placed around SCP-784's display surface to prevent anyone from attempting to remove it from its enclosure, new visual effects can be turned on without affecting the underlying code; this includes changing the direction of projections as well as adding more surfaces that create additional projections from existing ones (see Experiment Logs 784-A through -F). These effects can be turned off by removing 30 titanium rings from around SCP-784's display surface.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Titanium rings used in the containment of SCP-784.</p><p>The 3D projections produced by SCP-784 can be separated into two categories:</p><p>Other than these, any new visual effects and adaptations are currently under investigation.</p><p><strong>Experiment Log 784-A:</strong></p><p>Date: █/█/████</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-784 is placed inside an enclosure with 30 titanium rings. Two different colored squares are projected onto two surfaces of the display surface and are rotated 90 degrees to produce a 2-dimensional projection on the screen. The square to the left overlaps with the square to the right to create a 3D projection.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> A 2-dimensional projection of the geometric shape "C" (see Image) appeared on the screen and was rotated so that it was facing leftward towards the viewer. No other anomalous effects occurred.']</p>
