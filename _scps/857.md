<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-857</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-857 is to be kept within a 1x1x2m object-proof box lined with cotton.</p><p>A small, mesh-covered petri dish containing soil obtained from an arid area of the continental US is to be placed within SCP-857's containment chamber at all times.</p><p>The room housing SCP-857 and the petri dish is to be kept sterile and free of any insects harmful to plants. SCP-857 is allowed access to a cage in the containment chamber which can be removed for maintenance if deemed necessary by field agents.</p><p>SCP-857's containment chamber is to be monitored for any change in temperature or moisture levels outside the normal confines of such liquids. As a precautionary measure against unexpected changes, all personnel working alongside SCP-857 are to wear full personal hazmat suits at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-857 is a genus of palm tree native to the eastern half of Africa.</p><p>SCP-857's leaves, when gathered and processed by humans, produce a mild toxin which causes extreme irritation in people who are exposed to it. Upon ingestion, however, the toxin is not absorbed and remains in the intestine until expelled 3-5 days later, when symptoms of severe stomach cramping occur and blood pressure rises sharply. The toxins produced by SCP-857 are typically lethal, although instances that are treated quickly enough may be able to spare their victims from full death due to cessation of blood flow temporarily to the brain.</p><p>SCP-857's leaves also contain a protein which allows them to regrow if any part of the plant is removed or damaged.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On 21/07/20██, SCP-857 was discovered on the outskirts of ████████, a town in Arizona, USA. Foundation agents were alerted to the plant by locals, who assumed it to be a cultivated variety.</p><p>Upon examination, the plant was found to be capable of growing several times faster than a normal palm tree under optimal conditions. Because of this, SCP-857 was transported to Site 27 for proper containment.</p><p>On 07/08/20██, SCP-857's toxin was successfully synthesised and a partial antidote developed. However, as of yet, no definitive cure has been found for SCP-857's effect."]</p>
