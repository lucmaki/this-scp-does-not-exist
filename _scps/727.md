<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-727</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All records of SCP-727-1 events have been expunged from public records and journals. Periodic psychic incursion scans are to be conducted on research subjects who have reported memory loss of encounters with SCP-727-1 instances, with corresponding amnestic treatment administered as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-727 is a humanoid entity of undetermined genetic composition, approximately 1.7 meters in height and weighing approximately 30 kilograms. The subject's hair color has been reported as ranging from ginger to blond, with the skin coloration attributed to gray and yellow. Although SCP-727 appears to possess an aging abnormality similar to SCP-173's appearance, SCP-727 does not appear to be affected by aging processes relating to human physiology.</p><p>SCP-727-1 is a class D cognitohazard affecting humans who experience physical contact with SCP-727 in the presence of visual documentation of the encounter. An individual affected by this effect will become unable to recall information concerning the event(s) within three months of exposure to SCP-727, regardless of their current memories relating to this event. Subjects usually react violently when they find out they have forgotten these experiences and are capable of inflicting serious injury upon themselves at such an attempt. Eventually, subjects report feeling as if they were experiencing said events again; research has shown that subjects may or may not experience actual hallucinations consistent with their beliefs regarding SCP-727. Initial testing was conducted on former members of the Church of the Broken God, whose religious supernatural beliefs regarding SCP-273 aided in establishing appropriate test conditions for studying the effects of SCP-727 on subjects who had experienced it previously. These include:</p><p>Subjects who have already experienced SCP-727-1 will claim that this experience was merely fictitious fiction created by a friend or family member as part of a prank.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Investigation into the origins of SCP-727 have been inconclusive and no conclusive evidence has been found. Although no physical traces of SCP-727 have been recovered, some circumstantial evidence has been found. The following document was found among the possessions of the founder of the Church of the Broken God, a man known as "The Abomination". The document is written in a language which appears to be that of a non-human species from Earth\'s prehistoric past. Analysis of this document is ongoing.']</p>
