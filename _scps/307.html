<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-307</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the nature of SCP-307, containment and power source for said item are currently non-existent. Attempts to defund or destroy SCP-307 through lawsuits have thus far proved fruitless. No further attempts at containment are to be made.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-307 is a miniature replica of the Park Boulevard Bus. The exterior, including the license plate reading SCP-307, is made to appear as a decoy located at Elvis Presley's Graceland estate in Memphis, TN. The interior of the vehicle is furnished with seating for thirty passengers, as well as a fully stocked kitchen and bathroom.</p><p>While contained, SCP-307 has shown no anomalous attributes aside from its ability to spontaneously teleport between two locations not in physical contact with each other. Teleportation seems to be instant, and appears to be automatic. Despite the lack of evidence that suggests teleportation during the duration of observation, it is believed to be probable due to the consistency of occurrence, and lack of any interference by personnel on duty. Additionally, moments before teleportation, a small "pop" can be heard.</p><p>SCP-307 is capable of holding up to one hundred passengers at one time without difficulty or complication. Maintenance staff have reported that during instances where over one hundred passengers are onboard, commotion and confusion will result due to added weight on affected areas. This can cause injuries to passengers in excess of acceptable standards.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
