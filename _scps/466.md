<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-466</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-466 is contained at Site-██ in an area made inaccessible to the general public, on-site secure perimeter established around the object in accordance with standard protocols for Euclid Class Keter-class objects. Instances of SCP-466-1 are to be contained in secure humanoid containment chambers or a small quarantine room, and monitored for any unexpected changes in behavior. Instances of SCP-466-2 are to be contained in isolation chambers with limited communication and restricted amounts of outside resources.</p><p>Subjects that become infected with SCP-466 are to be quarantined for one month after onset. The quarantine period is to be extended by one week for each month of the subject's life expectancy (up to a maximum of five months). Subjects that survive this period are Class I amnesticized and terminated.</p><p>The Foundation has no relations with individuals involved with the creation of new instances of SCP-466. If a new instance is created via any means other than existing instances, it is to be immediately neutralized using standard Class A amnestic protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-466 is a set of six symbiont pairs, hereafter SCP-466-1 and -2. Instances of SCP-466 range from humans to roughly the size of small dogs, although SCP-466-1 instances are always cephalopod and SCP-466-2 instances always human.</p><p>SCP-466's effects manifest upon exposure to one or more instances of SCP-466. The extent of this effect varies depending on the number of instances present.</p><p>The life expectancy of a subject exposed to an instance of SCP-466 increases by one year for each instance present. This does not apply if the subject is exposed after reaching the age of 40, or if two or more instances are present. Subjects do not experience any other change in behavior, including increase in physical activity or changes in mental or emotional state. In addition, all subjects exposed to SCP-466 report no change whatsoever in their lives other than increased longevity.</p><p>All subjects that become infected with SCP-466 report experiencing a series of hallucinations, ranging from vague sensations to highly specific sequences of events. These hallucinations typically involve talking animals, who provide advice and instruction on how to survive in a particular environment.</p><p>If two instances are present during an exposure, the effect extends to include members of the same species; however, only one instance at time can be contacted and instructed on survival techniques.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 466-1:</strong> Instances of SCP-466 were recovered in the Arctic region after a Foundation archaeological expedition uncovered several human remains that had been buried together with a variety of anomalous items. A partial bone fragment of an instance of SCP-466 was recovered from one of the burials and catalogued by the Foundation\'s Anthropology department, who also uncovered two additional instances of SCP-466 in separate excavations. It is unclear how long these artifacts were buried before being recovered.</p><p><strong>SCP-466-1:</strong> Instances of SCP-466-1 resemble cephalopods, ranging in size from that of small dogs to those of whales. They are sapient, although their intelligence is not well documented. SCP-466-1 instances generally appear to be friendly and benevolent, but can exhibit aggressive behavior if threatened or attacked.</p><p>SCP-466-1 instances have been known to provide advice on survival techniques for humans, primarily when living on land. Their advice matches what humans would expect to hear from another individual, such as "You need to get out of here now," "Run for your life", and "Hide in a cave." While most advice is easily discerned, there are some cases where the advice becomes more obscure or cryptic. These instances are more likely to direct subjects to seek something other than food or shelter; however, they will allow subjects to survive if they follow their advice.</p><p>Because SCP-466-1 instances show no observable changes in behavior during their contact, it is assumed that the subjects involved perceive their messages as hallucinations rather than reality.</p><p>SCP-467 - The Catacombs']</p>
