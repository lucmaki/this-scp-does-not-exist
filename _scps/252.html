<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-252</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A picture of SCP-252 is to be placed behind the bar in all instances of SCP-252 to prevent the use of its glamour.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-252 is the name given to a small private club located in Long Island City, New York City. SCP-252 is a "gentlemen's club for the gentlemanly" according to its sign and staff.</p><p>The interior of SCP-252 is decorated in a style matching that of a stereotypical cabaret nightclub. The majority of the clientele do not leave from the ceiling to expose the bar area, which is typically reserved for patrons seated at tables. This extends to all balconies and levels accessible from floors above or below those allocated for seating. Patrons who attempt to access these areas will be greeted by an automated voice claiming that the area is reserved for dancing and the like and that such individuals are not welcome. Patrons are permitted to deduct up to 150 credits from their bills if they are denied access and directed to speak with a staff member on duty.</p><p>The cover charge for entrance into SCP-252 is 50 credits, but any patron who can prove he has paid would be treated as a free guest of SCP-252. Interested parties who have received permission from Foundation agents may make their first visit during an interview with Dr. Corso scheduled three days after they have been interviewed by security personnel in expectation of their arrival at their final destination.</p><p>Drink orders are automatically taken by the staff, with no interaction necessary on behalf of the patron. Orders are placed via databases linked to automated wine dispensers throughout SCP-252; it should be noted that standard beverage packages for each type of alcohol available at least offer basic information about each drink, such as how much it costs and what supplies are used in its creation.</p><p>Drinks distributed by these dispensers will always contain precisely 2 liters of liquid when brought to the patron's table or chair, regardless of the actual size required for consumption (such as 1 liter glasses used only by older patrons). Furthermore, this beverage cannot be made into two or more servings simultaneously by any mechanism other than filling whatever vessel is available at hand until it reaches its maximum capacity; attempts to mix beverages previously made will result in them becoming separated on contact.*</p><p>The ability of some individuals to distribute drinks freely despite having limited resources (particularly those with dietary restrictions) has been noted as anomalous among Foundation personnel assigned at SCP-252; however, as these medications are obtained through legitimate channels, resupplying them with more than one such product per month would be considered unnecessary by other departments.</p><p>Dining instructions have been altered so that "patrons may dine together if they choose" regardless of their potential abilities; likewise, multiple items on tables may be consumed together through working together toward a common end rather than independently.*</p><p>In addition to its restaurant services, SCP-252 serves various drinks banned in other establishments (including poisons), allowing patrons inside SCP-252 to evade normal laws against consumption of illegal substances without penalty.* All servers appear as regular civilians unless records indicating otherwise were obtained beforehand; further details on this anomaly may be found below.</p><p>Further information on known anomalies associated with Foundation personnel assigned or formerly assigned to SCP-252 may be found here: http://www.scpuk/overview/2281/</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
