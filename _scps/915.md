<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-915</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-915 is currently uncontained. Its "house" has been emptied of all materials that could be used as a flammable source and is now the focus of an investigation to prevent future incidents.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-915 is a bicolored domestic shorthair cat with a dark gray coat, blue eyes, and white paws. It appears to have very little in the way of physical strength. However, it can detect at least one flammable source from over 300 meters away, and has responded to this ability artificially by combing its fur into a more pointed shape when combustible materials have been nearby.</p><p>SCP-915 also appears to be capable of detecting an ignition source from even greater distances (its wounds will heal much faster if it detects an ignition source). This may be attributed to the fact that it does not appear to suffer any significant injuries in the absence of fire, despite being struck by various objects, including firearms; its bones remain unmarred. SCP-915 seems to prefer not to use its enhanced senses for such tasks and often uses a clumsier method or simply ignores the stimulus entirely.</p><p>When ignited, SCP-915 will react by attempting to find its owner. If unable or unwilling to communicate or resist, it will attempt to exit through the nearest window or door. The amount of damage it inflicts upon itself while doing so varies based on how long it is trapped inside and has been observed varying between "minor discomfort" and "severely disfigured." Even when unconscious, SCP-915's fur remains arranged around its mouth as though trying to protect it from itself.</p>
<p> ["Addendum 915-C</p><p>Studies have been conducted on the nature of SCP-915's anomalous abilities. The results of these studies can be found in the following document.</p><p>SCP-915 is the most dangerous of all of my creatures. I would not be surprised if you found it more difficult to contain than any of my others. However, that is not to say that you cannot contain it. My theory is that its ability to detect flammable sources is connected to its inability to heal itself. If this were true, then removing the source of ignition would render it unable to self-ignite. This is obviously a hypothesis at present and will require some testing before it can be confirmed. Even if we can prove that this is true, it does not mean that other cats are safe from your containment team. We've seen how quickly they can react to a single spark and even the most placid of housecats could easily escape containment by igniting the building around them.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, I have prepared an additional experiment for your team members. This time, the ignition source will be a taper candle rather than a flame. Candles are much less dangerous than firearms and will both provide a better test of your containment procedures and give you an opportunity to observe the differences in reaction between cats."]</p>
