<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-77</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-77 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. Access to it is restricted to personnel with Level II clearance or higher, and any other entry is prohibited without permission from a Level III researcher. Personnel attempting to enter SCP-77's containment must wear protective breathing apparatuses at all times. No personnel are to remain in the area of SCP-77's containment for more than five minutes.</p><p>Should an instance of SCP-77-1 manifest in the area of SCP-77's containment, immediate reentry into SCP-77's containment chamber must be made until all instances of SCP-77-1 have been neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-77 is a humanoid male with no vital signs, formerly held at Site-██.</p><p>Instances of SCP-77-1 are anomalous human subjects (designated SCP-77-1 instances) that manifest as one of two possible outcomes from a high-stakes game of blackjack played at Casino ████ in Las Vegas. In order to successfully play the game, an instance must be given 25 Bitcoins, which are on record[DATA EXPUNGED] and have been confirmed obtained by the instance. Both outcomes will result in the death of an instance of SCP-77-1.</p><p>The name "Casino ████" has been redacted from all publicly available records. All instances of SCP-77-1 have been verified to be human beings through DNA testing, regardless of whether or not they were able to take out their own life during the game. Instances associated with SCP-77 were all goaded into playing Blackjack by a man identifying himself as Adrian Salinger, who was previously thought to be under Foundation surveillance prior to his disappearance.</p><p>SCP-77's physical appearance is currently unaltered; however, several minor anomalies are present. While its physical body remains unchanged, numerous internal organs have failed, and damage has been sustained to several major blood vessels. Its circulatory system fails at regular intervals due to damage sustained throughout its containment, each time resulting in a deadlier death for an SCP-77-1 instance. The heart has suffered the most damage; due to this it appears more vital than its other organs, though it does not function normally. Failure of the heart results in either massive bleeding or shrinking (see Addendum 77). Minor brain damage has also occurred due to repeated failures of vital tissue in SCP-77's head. Elasticity testing has shown that SCP-77's spine and ribs are now severely deformed, and that it cannot flex them without experiencing pain. Despite these damages and inconveniences, SCP-77 can move its arms and legs freely and displays no apparent discomfort or health concerns when carried out of its cell..</p><p>The second outcome is much more extreme; namely [DATA EXPUNGED]. It is believed that either the casino where SCP-77 was contained or the Foundation itself may hold the key to preventing this event.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 77:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-77-1 instance #1221 died of massive hemorrhaging and tissue damage, with a heart rate of <0.0001 seconds. At this point, SCP-77-1 instance #1221 was the only instance in its containment chamber, and all testing was paused to avoid further injury.</p><p>However, due to the damage sustained to its heart and brain, the instance's autonomic functions continued until it expired. The dead body of SCP-77-1 instance #1221 later spontaneously reanimated, despite having been rendered unresuscitable by its death.</p><p>SCP-77-1 instances continue to suffer from their injuries, though the severity of their condition appears to be directly proportional to how much pain they are in. As such, SCP-77-1 instances experience no discomfort at all when put under extreme physical conditions; regardless of whether or not they suffered from earlier damage. For example, instances show no discomfort when being hanged, asphyxiated, or slowly boiled alive; rather, they appear to enjoy these conditions.</p><p>SCP-77's effect on SCP-77-1 instances has become less severe over time; with the exception of the most recent deaths, SCP-77's effect is now only visible during blackjack games played in Las Vegas. All known SCP-77-1 instances have been located in the greater Las Vegas area and have exhibited a strong preference for blackjack games at casinos in this area (approximately ██████████%). Given the nature of SCP-77's effect, it is theorized that people living within 15 miles of Las Vegas also appear more susceptible to SCP-77's influence; though this is unverified."]</p>
