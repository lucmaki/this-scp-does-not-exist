<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-565</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-565 is currently contained in a 1 m x 3 m x 3 m containment cell. Four observation windows have been constructed into SCP-565's floor and walls, and are only to be opened during testing. A food trough is also provided for the enclosure's standard diet of rodent and bird species.</p><p>During testing, one (1) D-Class personnel is to remain within SCP-565's area at all times, armed with a P90 submachine gun. Failure to comply with containment procedures will result in termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-565 is a three story apartment complex comprised of masonry, wood, and plastics. The exterior of SCP-565 only exhibits moderate wear and tear.</p><p>The interior of SCP-565 houses many complex mechanisms within each unit, including but not limited to:</p><p>No structural damage has been recorded, nor has any anomalous consequence been reported without the presence of a subject with knowledge of mathematics or science.</p><p>SCP-565 was discovered by Foundation agents after an anonymous tip was received to a local law enforcement agency in ████████, Italy. The whereabouts of the originator is currently unknown, as individuals that provided aid in the initial investigation were subjected to amnesticization. A 32 year old male resident of ████████ was apprehended by Foundation agents and taken into custody after testing the anomaly.</p><p>SCP-565-1 is a grey cat found within one of the rooms on all three floors of SCP-565. When approached, SCP-565-1 will retreat into a hiding spot within said room until prompted to exit. Attempts at sedation have failed due to a creature that appears to be composed of various metals and electronics, giving off noxious fumes in the process.</p><p>Test Procedure: D-50522, who is familiar with mechanics and basic programming, is to be left alone in SCP-565 for two (2) weeks. D-50522 is currently in the seventh week following his arrival at Site ██ for the duration thereof.</p><p>On ██/██/20██ at 10:09 AM EST, D-50522 exited SCP-565's front door with one minute remaining before its expiration time limit. Upon exiting SCP-565's front door, D-50522 proceeded down the stairs leading to the raised bedroom area of SCP-565. He then proceeded into the bedroom area where he observed SCP-565's primary anomaly being transpiring (See Notes From Testing Log). After closing the bedroom door behind him, D-50522 proceeded down the stairs leading back towards SCP-565's entrance to signal his desire to return home; however, he became paralyzed and collapsed into unconsciousness when he attempted to leave SCP-565. Upon recovery by Foundation medical staff, D-50522 was nonresponsive to questions regarding his experience within SCP-565 during his test period.</p><p>The following is an excerpt from D-50522's diary which contains statistical evidence that his paralysis was not caused by natural causes:</p><p>Diary Entries Only Found Basingstoke 1129/06/20</p><p>05:30 am: Wake up from nightmare about being pulled out from my family every 2 months for forced military training. No improvement through conversation with mother on phone call this morning; I'll call again tomorrow night if nothing changes…</p><p>10:00 am: I'm packing my bag for my leave from here tomorrow morning; I just wish writing about what I've experienced so far could make it all go away…</p><p>10:48 am: Joking around with my friend on Skype before leaving bed today; enjoying our time together being able to just talk about anything we want without it being considered "off limits". Sometimes I just don't know why my last name isn't more popular as everyone else on my branch of service….</p><p>12:00 pm: Leaving the house now; is it getting hot outside? Can't tell since my window won't open…. 1101/06/21</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Testing Log</p><p>On ██/██/20██ at 11:57 AM EST, D-50522 was released from medical treatment and returned to the recovery wing of Site ██. During the recovery process, D-50522 expressed confusion regarding his paralysis while in SCP-565.</p><p><strong>D-50522:</strong> I\'m sorry if I had gotten you guys in trouble for not doing a test with me in there. It\'s just that I can\'t recall ever having been paralyzed before entering SCP-565.</p><p><strong>Researcher Highfield:</strong> "Any doubt that your paralysis is not a natural condition?"</p><p><strong>D-50522:</strong> No, I mean, no. I had never experienced anything like it before…</p><p><strong>Researcher Highfield:</strong> "Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. We will be conducting further tests to answer your question."</p><p><strong>D-50522:</strong> Alright, alright….</p><p>The following is an excerpt from D-50522\'s diary during his test period, which indicates that he did not have any recollection of his experience in SCP-565, but could recall a memory of a dream he experienced during his recovery period. The following is a partial transcript of one such dream, as transcribed by D-50522\'s journal:</p><p>Diary Entries Only Found Basingstoke 1130/06/21</p><p><strong>08:09 pm:</strong> A man comes out of the shadows. He speaks in an accent I can\'t identify, but he speaks English very well and asks to see only me. He says something about my name being written on my arm for all to see. I ask what he means by "only me"; he says "we are all here", or some variation thereof. He then walks away into the darkness past a window; I try to follow him with my eyes, but am unable to make out his figure as it disappears into the darkness beyond the glass. When I turned back to face the man he was gone; all that was left of him was a single molecule of his existence drifting across my window like a dream.</p><p>Notes From Testing Log</p><p>Every memory from D-50522\'s test period was proven to be false upon analysis via Foundation personnel trained in science and mathematics. However, during his recovery period, D-50522 experienced a dream which accurately replicated what occurred within SCP-565. This indicates that D-50522\'s conscious self was somehow capable of accessing information outside of time</p>
