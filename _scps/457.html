<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-457</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-457 is contained within a standard containment vault at Site-██. The entrance is to be guarded by two armed guards at all times when the device is in use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-457 is a ground-level containment vault constructed of concrete and steel. The interior of the chamber is lined with several plastic sheets to reduce the effects of the continuous downpour.</p><p>The exterior of SCP-457's chamber is made entirely of an unknown material that functions as a vacuum to keep natural rainfall from reaching the area outside the chamber. Measures have been taken in order to further contain SCP-457's effect via containment seals and radar monitoring, but local populations are unaware that their elevated precipitation comes from within the Foundation facility.</p><p>Continuous use of SCP-457 will cause the precipitation to collect into a dirty, brownish liquid that is reabsorbed by the atmosphere. The torrents produced are roughly consistent with a moderately heavy rainfall, though some reports suggest that higher volumes have been produced.</p><p>SCP-457 makes no indication as to what purpose it serves beyond its anomalous properties. No evidence has been found to suggest that it was built prior to 1940, though portions of it dating from World War II have been last seen in use in 1944. Prior attempts at communication through written characters have proven futile.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-457 was discovered in 2010 at a Superfund Site in ██████, ████. Foundation agents were dispatched to the site to investigate and recover any hazardous materials present. During this investigation, Agent ████████ was struck by an object that appeared to be a crudely shaped stone. Upon closer examination, it was found to be a crudely carved human face measuring roughly 1m x 2m.</p><p>Agent ████████ consented to Foundation agents recovering the sculpture for study and containment. When Agent ████████ had recovered from his injuries, the sculpture was taken back to Site-██ for further testing and analysis.</p>
