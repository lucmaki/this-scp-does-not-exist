<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-221</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-221 is currently non-operational and is to be kept in its standard containment locker. It is to be locked with a key only possessed by Dr. ████████. A Level 3 access key is also required to deactivate the object. When not being used as a system upgrade, SCP-221 should be stored at level 4b of the safe room in a secure locker.</p><p>Due to its limited operational history, SCP-221 has been deemed a Safe Class item and poses no threat to Foundation personnel or other SCPs.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-221 is a circuit board with a printed circuit board housing approximately 2,000 integrated circuits, each capable of performing 0.4 operations per microsecond. A 1Gbps packet buffer on the printed circuit board sends and receives data at rates of 121MB/s. When SCP-221 is not in use, all internal components are powered off and are only capable of performing point-to-point communication.</p><p>When SCP-221 is connected to any existing 2Gbps packet transmission system, it can perform a communication network utilizing only two dimensions. Currently, SCP-221 is being used as an upgrade for Foundation communications systems to transmit data at the speed of light.</p><p>SCP-221 was recovered from the ████████ Radio Observatory in ██████████, where it had been adapted into a point-to-point radio and installed on site by Dr. ████████. SCP-221's primary function was to send and receive experimental messages to and from Earth. An anomalous effect was observed when Dr. ████████ attempted to transmit data to Earth using SCP-221's sent data channel (the 'x' channel). Dr. ████████ reported that the transmitted data appeared as white radio waves propagating along a single dimension instead of along three dimensions.</p><p>When Dr. ████████ attempted to send data to Earth the second time, he noted that the white waves were no longer viewable as "points" but instead appeared as dim blue lights with an estimated intensity of one star per 100 trillion miles from Earth. Upon further experimentation, Dr. ████████ discovered that by transmitting information at speeds approaching light speed, any object could be viewed across multiple dimensions simultaneously.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On █/█/██, Foundation personnel were notified that a group of approximately thirty civilians had been observed exiting the ██████████ Radio Observatory. Foundation personnel were able to track the civilians to a nearby private residence, where they were detained. None of the civilians exhibited signs of anomalous or anomalous threat and are currently being detained as non-anomalous individuals.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Radio Observatory</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The ██████████ Radio Observatory is a privately funded radio telescope located in an uninhabited area in ███████. A large neon sign reads "███████ Observatory" and is illuminated by a display of the solar system with each planet labeled with a different color.</p><p>On the ground outside of the observatory, two sets of footprints indicate that two groups of three persons were observed exiting the facility separately. The tracks appear to have been made by two pairs of shoes and one set of bare feet; however several sets of footprints are visible due to repeated re-entry from one pair on another.</p><p>Examination of the floor outside the building show several items including an unused set of headphones, an unopened bottle of soda, and an empty match box.</p><p>The following written message was found on the inside of the door to the observatory:</p><p>Hey, guys!</p><p>Don\'t forget about our big night!</p><p>Come see what we\'ve been up to.']</p>
