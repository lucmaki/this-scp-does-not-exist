<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-626</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-626 is currently contained within an anomalous sphere in Sector-PENTAH, a containment bay at Site-46. Exposed materials from SCP-626 and its chamber are to be stored within standard anomalous containment containers.</p><p>Any personnel entering Sector-PENTAH require clearance from at least one member of the research staff. Any personnel approaching SCP-626 without clearance should be detained, with the potential for amnestic treatment if deemed necessary.</p><p>All detections of SCP-626 have been classified as MTF Epsilon-23 ("Wormhole"), tasked with locating the anomaly's vicinity and documenting any changes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-626 is a black hole, apparently located within Sector-PENTAH of Site-46. The space around SCP-626 is filled with a dense plasma field, which is likely a result of the black hole's extremely high gravitation.</p><p>SCP-626's presence causes an anomalous bulk flow in the plasma field, with the center of the mass being displaced along the direction of said flow. This displacement periodically saturates faster than expected: approximately once every hour, the center of the mass will "uncoil" to a distance of 13 km (8.1 mi) away from its position currently occupied by 52600m/s; it has been hypothesized that this may be caused by SCP-626's gravitational pull on any objects nearby.</p><p>At this distance, 52600m/s undergoes what appears to be massive acceleration and deceleration; however, no visible changes have been recorded over detected accelerations and decelerations. After an unknown amount of time (within two weeks), 52600m/s returns to its original position.</p><p>Scanning equipment is not capable of detecting these "undetected" events; testing was discontinued due to budget cuts, but is still able to locate the area around SCP-626.</p><p>The existence of this event is inconsistent; scans indicate it takes place at irregular intervals, but measurements taken from personnel approaching or entering Sector-PENTAH are consistent with previous observations.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/19██, D-8578 was accidentally drawn to SCP-626 by the mass displacement. However, as 52600m/s was not yet located at this time, it was not captured on camera. After several hours of searching, D-8578 recovered his camera and returned to his position after 04:44.</p><p>When returned to the film-receiving area, the footage had been altered. The lower half of the subject's body was replaced with a 3 meter (10\xa0ft) long black hole in mid-air; the subject's mouth was open, and it is assumed he was able to see the large object before being abducted.</p><p>Several minutes later, the footage was replaced with another image. The subject's original footage was placed beside the new one in a similar fashion, although the images were noticeably different.</p><p>The new image contained an image of an unknown female humanoid, which appeared to be injured. Upon closer inspection, the subject could be seen attempting to aid her. Further examination proved inconclusive, as the camera had been broken before it could be returned to its original location."]</p>
