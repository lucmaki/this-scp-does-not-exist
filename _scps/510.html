<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-510</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-510 is to be kept in a secure locker at Site-15. SCP-510 is to be physically prevented from leaving the locker when not actively used as a cover object. This is done via locking and sealing the locker with its key inside a sealed case.</p><p>A secondary locker key has been issued for standard containment procedures, but no recording devices are allowed permission to enter SCP-510.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-510 is a black shoulder bag, with a single silver key chain in the shape of the initials ‘A.D.’ A human counterpart of SCP-510 currently exists (see below for details).</p><p>SCP-510 is a standard laptop backpack, until it is opened. Its contents will then appear to be an object resembling a wooden staff. This staff has several properties that are not found in any known anomalous object:</p><p>SCP-510’s properties change depending on what is placed inside it. Staffed sofas and tables will become animate chairs and tables, respectively, while places consisting of multiple floors or rooms will become assemblages of random furniture. Empty rooms do not have this effect; however, they will still somehow have people in them when reopened.</p><p>Within three hours of the item being closed, all humans within a 1km radius of its location will become extremely intoxicated.</p><p>Once opened again, none of the affected individuals show any memory of the event, even if confronted about it afterwards by others who had witnessed it. The specific pattern and circumstances of the effect are unknown. It does not seem to affect robots or animals - only humans.</p><p>Individuals drunk from SCP-510 appear to experience an intense drunkenness similar to intoxication caused by alcohol, but with lessened physical impairment and more vivid hallucinations. Individuals affected display highly unrestrained behavior commonly associated with those suffering from alcoholics, but far beyond what could be expected from a normally sober person (such as engaging in sexual intercourse in public places).</p><p>Some users report feeling discomfort and other symptoms related to alcohol abuse compared to those without alcohol addiction. Other users have reported experiencing deathlike states while intoxicated from SCP-510 (such as time slowing or going backwards) or other effects such as heart attacks or permanent brain damage.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
