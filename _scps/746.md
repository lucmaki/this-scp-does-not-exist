<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-746</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-746 is contained in a standard containment unit at Site 77. SCP-746 may be housed with research personnel and non-knowledge of its true nature as an event horizon, composition and nature of the event horizon, and appearance, behaviour, size and shape of the "other side" are to be kept secret from all Foundation staff at all times.</p><p>Under no circumstances are nuclear detonations or any other means of producing large amounts of gamma radiation (with any level of intensity whatsoever) to be used by either Foundation staff or civilian personnel anywhere in the world. Any personnel who fail to follow this instruction should not be assigned to the area containing SCP-746.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-746 is a phenomenon caused by the activation of its anomalous properties when it is directly involved in at least 7,000 tons of nuclear material, in other words, either by causing or observing a nuclear detonation. The center of SCP-746 resembles a time-space event horizon and has the form of an exact circle with a radius of 2 meters. SCP-746 does not reveal what lies on the other side; all attempts to do so have failed.</p><p>When nuclear detonations occur with SCP-746 involved in their final stages, SCP-746 temporarily creates a time dilation field covering a roughly spherical area around itself for approximately ██ seconds immediately prior to the detonation, though this field's radius is determined by the amount of energy (in kilotons) detonated. This field causes all nearby matter to be pushed backwards in time (by factors ranging from 10-60 seconds per 1 kiloton) and concurrently expands the size and radius of SCP-746 itself while preventing anything outside it from entering. Most typically feature a structure resembling a double helix swirl composed of black smoke surrounded by white, as well as several streaks of red light moving outward from the center at various speeds depending on how far away they were from the detonation.</p><p>SCP-746 was discovered on ██/██/1982 when two ANT agents stationed in the vicinity of the village of ███████ attempted to investigate reports of unidentified lights moving through the sky at night. These lights were eventually tracked down to ROCADEK buildings in ███████, India. Foundation personnel sent to investigate all reported sightings described both large "doughnut" rings formed from doughnut shaped plasma balls and streaks of pink light that would weave through the center toward each other before coming together again at points close to what appeared to be an edge or rim; these streaks were later determined by Dr. ████████'s team to be several instances of SCP-███ contained within SCP-746's event horizon that had escaped containment for obscure reasons. As sightings continued, Foundation personnel began to notice peculiarities relating to time dilation and objects within SCP-746 being displaced backward in time; An investigation was launched shortly after ██/██/1982 and yielded several reports describing what appears to be multiple independent instances of ROCADEK buildings and (on 6/05/1983) both Foundation facilities on site occurring simultaneous detonations within approximately 3 hours of each other.</p><p>The reason for these time displacements is presently unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-746's effect on nuclear detonations is currently being studied by Dr. ████████ and his research team for possible use as a means of preventing future Foundation breaches, as well as to determine the nature of the other side of SCP-746."]</p>
