<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-412</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-412 is to be contained inside a 5m x 3m Secure-Containment Cell. SCP-412 must be fed a constant supply of organic matter from the research team. SCP-412 does not require food and minimal sustenance, however the containment staff must maintain a supply of non-sentient organic matter for around two weeks. The facility containing SCP-412 must be kept at a temperature of 68 °F. The room must be equipped with a heating system, fans and air conditioner units with no direct openings on the ceiling above the chamber.</p><p>All personnel working in or near SCP-412 must wear protective bodysuits and retain respiratory protection when inside the chamber. Breaches in containment are to be quickly sealed and medical staff brought in to assist any personnel affected by SCP-412. No human subjects are to be exposed to SCP-412 without prior written permission from an agent of level 3 clearance or higher, except during approved testing procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-412 is a humanoid entity with a head resembling that of an African elephant, large ears and a purple circular, nictitating membrane. SCP-412 is capable of vocalization, but its speech is unintelligible to humans. It appears to be sapient and follows a logical order to all subjects introduced to it. Testing has revealed that it remembers events outside testing procedures, but cannot retain details beyond one week after meeting the individual with whom it has interacted. This defect makes testing difficult in cases where more than one subject is present at the same time as SCP-412; however, this limitation does not apply in testing involving only one human subject, where it can accurately identify the person over periods exceeding one year.</p><p>SCP-412 absorbs the memories and personality of those who interact with it during testing, which causes severe changes in the behavior of personnel. Subjects exhibit signs of extreme distress when their memorized personalities are taken over by SCP-412. When a subject's memories are no longer needed for research purposes or for an indefinite period of time following exposure to SCP-412, SCP-412 will immediately leave the subject's body and return to its containment chamber.</p><p>Individuals exposed to SCP-412 report experiencing intense emotions during interaction with SCP-412 that do not respond to commonly used psychological tests and treatments. Following exposure to SCP-412, subjects have difficulty performing tasks requiring concentration or cooperation (including physical tasks such as driving vehicles) and have difficulty distinguishing what is real and what is imagined.</p><p>SCP-412 was initially discovered in ██████, France after reports began coming in from local police forces suggesting that several individuals had either been killed or found missing while on police duty inside a store in the city. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate suspected homicide/suicide incidents linked to what became known as "Afroclown" incidents. The individual responsible for most of these crimes was identified as Edgar ████████ (DOB: ██/██/1955), who was apprehended and detained by Foundation agents on 05/27/1973 after attempts at escaping custody led him into contact with low level MTF members assigned for trivial containment purposes; he was amnesticized after questioning regarding his actions.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
