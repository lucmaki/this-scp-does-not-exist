<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-424 has been officially classified as a New York-type urban legend. All individuals involved with SCP-424 are to be contained within Site-17's Low-Value Item Storage Unit (LVISU) immediately after the conclusion of their encounters with SCP-424.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-424 is a series of urban legends about low-end electronics and digital devices manufactured by █████ Corporation (formally ██████████████ Corporation).

This is accomplished by installing an elaborate series of traps in their product packaging. To date, these stories have been proven false; the █████ Corporation has made no attempt at tracking down either SCP-424's creator(s) or their methods for perpetuating it.</p><p>These stories claim that:</p><p>Within three months of exposure to these rumors, almost all individuals affected by exposure will purchase one or more █████ Corporation products.</p><p>The chances of this only increasing with each successive iteration of SCP-424 are unknown.</p>
