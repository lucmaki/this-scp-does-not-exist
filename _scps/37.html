<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-37</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-37 instances are to be kept in a sealed container in a secure, climate-controlled environment at Site-77. The temperature of the container is to be kept between 50 and 70 °C (122 and 158 °F).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-37 are a type of fruit, vaguely resembling apples on the outside, consisting of an outer shell containing approximately 8-10 smooth, white, round seeds. On the inside, they are completely hollow and contain a single large, upside-down insect which is pale yellow in colour and has several pairs of jointed limbs and wings. The insect has been clearly identified as belonging to the family Lycaenidae of butterflies. When examined under a microscope with a 200x magnifying lens, it has been identified as belonging to a species classified as Erigeron karvinskianus.</p><p>When eaten, SCP-37 will allow the butterfly inside to pass through the human digestive system until it exits at the other end. The intervals at which this occurs have been measured at 15 minutes between digestion and excretion, with a total length of 3 hours for the entire process.</p><p>After being excreted from the body, SCP-37 will be transformed into large, cartoonlike images of various insects and other creatures based on the contents of the stomach (with small portions going to waste due to improper placement) or similar objects or ideas that originated in the brain following ingestion of SCP-37. These images appear similar to cartoons produced using Adobe Flash or similar software applications.</p><p>SCP-37 does not affect people who do not view them as food or do not possess a stomach containing insects such as butterflies. This effect does not work on persons who do not possess butterflies in their stomachs. Further examination is pending approval by Site Director Harkins.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-37 was discovered on Friday, 23/03/2000 when a staff member reported experiencing indigestion. Upon examining the stomach, it was noted that it contained several SCP-37 instances, which were extracted and transferred to a containment chamber where they were discovered to have been transformed into cartoon images of butterflies before being excreted.</p><p>It should be noted that this phenomenon is not limited to SCP-37; all butterflies found in the stomachs of persons who have eaten SCP-37 have been similarly transformed. Further investigation is pending approval by Site Director Harkins.</p>
