<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-879</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the speed at which SCP-879 moves, its containment is mostly non-permanent and designed for short term expeditions. Several Foundation agents are to maintain a permanent vigil in Hawaii’s Kawaihae Island.</p><p>As SCP-879 will not stop to rest or eat, Foundation personnel must carry all necessary provisions with them. It is recommended that personnel bring an extended supply of non-perishable rations, a spare pair of boots, and appropriate clothing for the tropical climate.</p><p>Due to the fact that SCP-879 is capable of movement at speeds greater than any known land animal, it is recommended that personnel wear protective clothing and avoid direct contact.</p><p>Personnel are encouraged to take notes on SCP-879’s behavior while they observe it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-879 is an approximately 3 meter (10 feet) long, dinosaurid (sauropodid and/or sauropod) reptile. Based on its partially fossilized skeletal structure, SCP-879 appears to have been bipedal, bipedal carnivorous dinosaur.</p><p>SCP-879’s bony body has only partially fossilized, allowing for the possibility that it has lost several vital areas of its anatomy in previous encounters with modern animals. Its legs are the most grossly deformed, with the bones patched together with metallic duct tape; however, SCP-879 retains full mobility.</p><p>SCP-879 emits a low rumbling noise whenever it moves. This sound is difficult to discern from SCP-879's movement, as SCP-879’s body acts somewhat as a resonating chamber.</p><p>Instead of walking, SCP-879 can travel over long distances very quickly, varying between 9 and 11 meters per second (21 and 26 mph). The greatest speed sustained by SCP-879 was 15.5 meters per second (47 mph). If moved very slowly (<1 meter per second), SCP-879 will move very slowly; if moved moderately fast (~3 meters per second), this rate becomes increasingly faster; if moved very fast (~6 meters per second), drastically faster still.</p><p>Additionally, SCP-879 is capable of accelerating at extreme speeds when necessary; it extends its hind legs and pushes itself forward in order to increase its speed beyond its normal limits.</p><p>When interacting with human subjects, SCP-879 attempts to exploit aspects of their physicality or intelligence to signal or intimidate them. It appears to identify individuals by the chaotic nature of their personality before attacking them directly or consuming them in a predatory fashion. Due to its unpredictable nature, initial contact with SCP-879 can be dangerous for Foundation personnel as well as any civilians attempting to escape from it.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is a log of interactions between SCP-879 and various civilians.</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>11:38 AM, 8/3/1999</p><p>An individual known as Mr. A. Tsubaki arrives at Kawaihae Island with his wife and four children. SCP-879 approaches them while they are taking a walk on the beach. SCP-879 begins to approach Mr. Tsubaki, who steps back and begins to run towards the rest of his family.</p><p>Mr. Tsubaki runs past his wife and children, and rounds another corner in the path of SCP-879. The rest of his family remain out of view, but SCP-879 is heard moving about behind Mr. Tsubaki's back and roaring in frustration; it stops roaring after a moment and begins to move slowly after Mr. Tsubaki, who is still running at a very fast pace.</p><p>SCP-879 continues chasing Mr. Tsubaki for approximately one minute until he collapses from exhaustion, causing SCP-879 to stop chasing him as well; it then approaches Mr. Tsubaki and begins to lick and pet him before allowing him to sit up again. SCP-879 then begins to sit on the ground next to Mr. Tsubaki, despite the lack of any open space there, and allows him to rest until he recovers from his exhaustion.</p><p>09:00 AM, 8/4/1999</p><p>Mr. Tsubaki reports that he had been chased by SCP-879 for approximately 40 minutes before being able to escape it and seek shelter on the beach. SCP-879 has not been seen since this incident, though Foundation personnel observed that there was a large amount of drool on the ground where it was resting.</p>
