<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-254</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-254 is contained in a standard containment unit, with the exception of the holding tank, which has been outfitted with an automatic feeder to simulate it being in its natural environment. The holding tank should be checked weekly for any signs of growth.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-254 is a raised graffito in the shape of a diving green tree frog, located on the exterior of a building in Frankfurt, Germany. The graffito was painted sometime in the 1980s and appears to have been at least partially faded, though the original design remains clear.</p><p>SCP-254 has the ability to cause any object that it touches to gain the appearance and properties of a member of the amphibian class of animals, while also maintaining its shape and mass. To date, SCP-254 has been able to produce three different species:</p><p>Despite being massed produced, these compounds all retain their chemical properties as terrestrial creatures. Further evidence indicates that SCP-254 was capable of producing these compounds prior to containment.</p><p>While most affected objects retain no memory or knowledge of the process by which they were affected, some subjects will be able to remember what it felt like to be affected by SCP-254. Note that this does not always occur with subjects previously affected by SCP-254. (See Addendum 254.)</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 254:</strong> This is a log of the events surrounding SCP-254's discovery.</p><p>On February 7th, 1981, an anonymous source called the police and reported a green tree frog graffito on the exterior wall of a building in Frankfurt, Germany. The building was located at ██████████ ██████, in the Kreuzberg district. Police officers arrived and were able to remove the graffiti within 10 minutes, at which point it was determined that the building was owned by ███████████ ████████. When questioned about the graffito, ███████ ████████ stated that he had painted it himself but could not recall why he did so.</p><p>Within a few days, three additional instances of SCP-254 were found. All of these buildings were located in Frankfurt's inner city and had been painted sometime between 1979 and 1982. Following this discovery, the Foundation was brought into contact with the German Department for Criminal Investigation (Kriminalpolizei), who initiated an investigation into SCP-254.</p><p>Several weeks later, D-Class personnel were assigned to conduct interviews with local residents in order to collect evidence related to SCP-254. As such, Dr. ████ ████████████ began to discuss SCP-254 with one of his D-Class assistants, ████ ████████.</p><p>On February 28th 1981, Dr. ████████████ and ████████ were given permission by their supervisors to begin conducting interviews with local residents regarding the appearance of SCP-254. During this time, Dr. ████████████ suggested that they interview a local resident who had recently painted their house. The two agents agreed and proceeded to speak to Mr. ██████████, who confirmed that he had painted his house but could not recall what he had intended to paint on it. He then stated that he had begun painting around Christmas time, and that the green tree frog image was new to him upon its appearance.</p><p>After this initial interview, Dr. ████████████ began asking Mr. ██████████ more questions about SCP-254's appearance and properties. Asking if he remembered any of the colors in the frog's skin, Mr. ██████████ said that he could not remember anything except for the green color. At this point, Dr. ████████████ told Mr. ██████████ that he believed that it was green for a reason and that it must have something to do with his work as a painter, since it had appeared on his house around Christmas time. Following this small conversation, Dr. ████████████ asked about the large mural behind Mr. ██████████'s house and asked if there were any other colors besides green used in it. Mr. ██████████ responded that there were many greens used in the mural but none of them were exact copies of one another nor did they appear to be connected in any way. At this point, Dr. ████████████ offered Mr. ██████████ cash if he would paint any other colors on his house but later retracted the offer when he realized that his assistant was only interested in SCP-254's effects rather than its origins or true nature.</p><p>Following this incident, Dr. ████████████ attempted to further investigate SCP-254's nature without success until shortly after a child was hospitalized following an accident involving an outdoor swing on April 30th 1981. After visiting his patient while recovering from his injuries, Dr., James F██████ noticed several children playing on swings set up near a nearby park and proposed to Dr., James P███████ that they go play nearby as well to see if SCP-254 had any effect on children as well as adults for comparison purposes."]</p>
