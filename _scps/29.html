<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-29</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-29 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. All outfits worn by SCP-29 are to be confiscated upon discovery, and replaced with standard uniforms. The floor of the containment cell is to be covered with a layer of sand to prevent SCP-29 from escaping.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-29 is a human female, aged 38. Its appearance is consistent with that of a normal human female from the Lower 48, with minor differences to the appearance of its hands and feet.</p><p>When in a state of depression or despair, SCP-29 will begin to cry. After about twenty minutes of crying, SCP-29 will become enraged, and within two additional hours will begin to scream for roughly six hours non-stop until it falls asleep. The agitation exhibited by SCP-29's state is extremely unusual, roughly analogous to that of an ordinary human child under the age of ten years old.</p><p>In addition, SCP-29 has a particular fascination with the phrase "goodbye Wyoming". If SCP-29 hears this phrase spoken aloud, it will become very distressed, and agitated. If echoed by another person in a similar manner (i.e., speaking the phrase as if they were leaving Wyoming), SCP-29 will become enormously excited, and rapidly attempt to accumulate as many items related to Wyoming as is possible.</p><p>After eight hours, SCP-29 will fall asleep, and establish its baseline behavior.</p><p>Within three days of exposure to the phrase "goodbye Wyoming", SCP-29 will attempt to leave its containment cell and seek out any persons who have recently left the state of Wyoming. SCP-29 does not appear to experience any fear or discomfort when attempting escape; in fact, it appears to take delight in this behavior.</p><p>SCP-29 has been moved twice due to complaints from local staff; all instances of SCP-29 move along with themselves when exposed to the phrase "goodbye Wyoming". Once every five days, SCP-29 would attempt to return to its containment cell unless restrained from doing so. In addition resulting in damage and/or destruction of surroundings; most notably, ██ caravans were burned after being hit by a falling meteorite.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-29 has not attempted to escape or destroy its containment cell in over fifteen hours. When asked if it was aware of the phrase "goodbye Wyoming", SCP-29 expressed minimal knowledge of the area, and had no desire to leave its current location. SCP-29 is currently sleeping.']</p>
