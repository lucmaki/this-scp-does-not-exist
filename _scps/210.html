<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-210</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-210 is to be kept in a standard containment locker located within Site ██'s Safe-class Safe. It is to be placed inside its containment locker at all times. No personnel are to view the object or any other text files written on SCP-210.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-210 is a standard keyboard made by Apple. The object's appearance and functionality are similar to other keyboards produced by the same company. However, when a text file is saved onto SCP-210, it will display a message reading as follows:</p><p>All words written on this keyboard shall be true.</p><p>Testing has shown that these words appear wherever the file is saved, even on computers which do not have any saved files. Once saved, the text will remain; any attempt to erase the area will result in the words becoming more prominently visible. It is believed that these extra words were written by an unknown third party, since the files do not contain any text from the user. Attempts to remove all of the anomalous text produced by SCP-210 resulted in several blank lines being added to the document, but otherwise yielded no effect.</p><p>The only way to prevent SCP-211 from occurring is to empty its contents entirely before saving. This includes clearing the buffer to avoid overwriting previously saved files with new ones. Attempting to delete individual words or phrases will not prevent SCP-211 from occurring again. However, attempts have been made using different methods of deletion, such as erasing certain characters or replacing them with others (e.g., writing "">" where ">" would normally appear). These attempts, while successful in removing anomalous text from SCP-210, have also caused it to reappear elsewhere within the computer's storage area or even on other computers connected to a network (see Addendum 210-1).</p><p>Since all instances of SCP-211 are logged and can be traced back when they occur (see Addendum 210-2), it can be assumed that somebody knew about SCP-210 and had been aware of this anomaly for some time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 210-1:</strong> Incident 210-1:</p><p>On █/█/20██, a researcher at Site ██ was to conduct a project which involved creating a new file using SCP-210. The researcher was instructed to empty SCP-211\'s buffer before saving the file. However, when the file was created and saved, the words "[DATA EXPUNGED]" appeared instead of the expected text. The file itself was erased immediately, but this caused SCP-211 to reappear on all computers connected to the network. This incident is currently classified as a Level 3 priority.</p>
