<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-109</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Partial Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-109 is currently contained at Site-███. In order to keep SCP-109 contained, it is placed in a standard containment chamber, which has been fitted with motion sensors and cameras. The chamber also contains a small table, upon which SCP-109 will usually sit in its containment chamber. To prevent potential escape attempts via this method, it is barred from the “front door” of its containment chamber, and all doors are locked.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-109 appears to be a 19 year old Caucasian male. Its current appearance and age are consistent with its age at time of anomalous manifestation in ████, USA, as well as it being 19 years old when it was originally contained. SCP-109's height is approximately 1.75 meters, and it weighs approximately 61 kg. SCP-109 does not appear to be capable of any sort of motion that would suggest being able to walk, and is unable to communicate.</p><p>SCP-109 displays the following anomalous properties:</p><p>Attempts to communicate with SCP-109 have proven unsuccessful. When spoken to, SCP-109 reacts as if its hearing is not functioning properly, and will make hand motions towards the source of the voice. It will make similar gestures when read the same text multiple times.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 109-A:</strong> On ██/██/██, a recorded interview was conducted with SCP-109. The following transcript is the result of the interview. Note that the interview was conducted in the same location that SCP-109 had been contained in, and it was made clear to SCP-109 that it would be revealed to the listener.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. █████</p><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-109</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> I need to ask you some questions, please try to answer as best as you can, we\'re going to record this for later analysis.</p><p><strong>SCP-109:</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> How old are you?</p><p>SCP-109 points at itself.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> Oh, I thought you were going to look at your watch or something? We\'re recording this for later analysis, so please keep that in mind. How old are you now?</p><p>SCP-109 makes a waving motion towards one of the cameras in the room. It then points at its own head, and then at Dr. █████\'s face.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> Uh… what do you mean?</p><p>SCP-109 points at itself again.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> Right, right, yes, I get it, you\'re a human being, not just a human shape. Can you tell me your name?</p><p>SCP-109 makes a pointing motion towards its chest, which could be interpreted as “name” or “heart”. It then waves towards one of its eyes.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> Right, alright… so what\'s your name?</p><p>SCP-109 points towards its left eye.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> So you have two eyes? Is there anything else about you that is important to know? Can you tell me about yourself?</p><p>SCP-109 makes two hand gestures towards itself, which could be interpreted as “I” and “me” or “self” and “self” or “myself” and “myself”; SCP-109 does not seem to understand the concept of a name as an entity separate from themselves, as it cannot speak in sentences such as these (for example, "I am myself"). SCP-109 will also make two hand motions when asked about an aspect of its body that it does not understand (for example, "Why does my arm hurt?"). It is unknown if SCP-109 has any understanding of the concept of pain, but it showed no discomfort during communication with Dr. █████ when he applied pressure to various parts of its body (for example, touching its arm). This means it may have some sort of understanding of pain due to its current anomalous properties.</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> What is your purpose here?</p><p>SCP-109 makes a hand gesture towards itself and then to Dr. █████\'s face. It then waves towards one of the cameras in the room while making a wiggling motion with its hand and extending it towards the camera\'s lens (it is unknown if this is meant to be some sort of motion for “camera”).</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> I don\'t understand… can you say that again?</p><p>SCP-109 makes two hand gestures at Dr. █████\'s face, although this time it does not wave toward the camera lens with its hand; instead it makes a series of short tapping motions on Dr. █████\'s face with its fingers and hand (in this way SCP-109 appears to be gesturing that Dr. █████ should look at his own face). After several minutes of this, SCP-109 makes another gesture to itself and makes another series of tapping motions over its own face while making an expression suggesting confusion (“why did I do that?”). Dr. █████ reaches an agreement with SCP-109 to try this again in three days time (following standard Foundation procedure) and SCP-109 agrees to continue communicating with him on a weekly basis for two weeks and then every month for the rest of their lives (following standard Foundation procedure). After this agreement is reached, Dr. █████ begins speaking to SCP-109 in a normal voice.</p><p><End Log></p><p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> On ██/██/██ after being interviewed several times over the course of two weeks by Dr. █████, SCP-109 appeared to “shut down” completely upon leaving Site-███; it was unable to react in any way other than remaining seated on a chair in Site-███’s briefing room until containment procedures were enacted again.']</p>
