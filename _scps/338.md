<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-338</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> nan</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-338 is to be kept in a secure cell until it manifests.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-338 appears as a human female of approximately 1.8m (5 ft 11.6in) in height. The subject's skin is a uniform deep brown colour, which changes to light brown when exposed to sunlight. SCP-338 possesses two breasts, each measuring at 50cm (19.7in) in circumference and weighing between 2kg (4.4bw) and 3kg (6.8bw) respectively, giving it a body mass index (BMI) of 27-29. One of its eyes is black and the other is blue; that eye is covered by an eyepatch due to a minor case of traumatic retinal detachment. SCP-338 does not appear to have any other visible bodily orifice aside from the eyes, mouth and ears, although it may still be able to eat and hear sounds through otherwise inaccessible areas of its body.</p><p>SCP-338 is normally kept in a small white cell measuring 4m (13.1ft) by 4m (13.1ft), with no access to windows or sunlight. It will attempt to escape its cell at irregular intervals, with one escape attempt in 28 days recorded so far. When released SCP-338 can move along the ground at speeds exceeding 50km/h (31mph), although this speed gradually slows over time unless provided with sustained exercise. Attempting to cause injury to SCP-334 results in marks identical to those left on skin by an animal's claws or teeth being drawn upon the subject's body, although these wounds are invariably healed within 24 hours after being made.</p><p>SCP-338 has demonstrated an unusual ability to understand the speech of others regardless of their capacity for speech or understanding language. This effect is thought to be caused by its highly advanced sensory system allowing it to detect patterns in human vocal emissions and transmitting them directly into the brain of another person regardless of language barrier or comprehension capabilities; however, this has only been proven on Foundation personnel so far.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-338 was found in ██████, a small town in ████, Mexico. A series of murders had been occurring in the town in which victims were killed via a single bite to the neck, often leaving behind a puncture mark similar to one left by an animal's fangs. The bodies were recovered from these locations with only small portions of flesh missing from the neck, often leaving the body in a similar state to the one it was found in; the crime scenes were also littered with the corpses of animals similar to those seen outside the town.</p><p>SCP-338 was discovered wandering the streets of ██████ after reports of a large number of animals being killed in the area. It was quickly brought into Foundation custody and classified as an Euclid Neutralized Object after it was determined that it posed no threat to Foundation personnel, and would be dead within 2-3 days time if not provided with sustenance. It has been housed at Site-██ since this time."]</p>
