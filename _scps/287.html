<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-287</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-287 is locked in storage unit #21. Access to the item is restricted to Site recreation staff. A cover story has been devised, involving spontaneous combustion of a non-anomalous fire hydrant, as a preventative measure against containment breach.</p><p>Personnel who use this object are to be monitored for signs of SCP-287's effect. D-Class and other expendable personnel may be used for experimentation if necessary. No testing is to occur outdoors, or on any civilian population larger than 500 people. Foundation personnel involved in testing are required to wear Level 4 lead radiation face masks at all times. The use of SCP-287 may only be undertaken by personnel with clearance level 3 or higher. Current maximum level of suspected clearance is ████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-287 is a fake fire hydrant constructed from fiberglass and metal, installed in an unnamed public park in █████████████, Michigan. Installed at the center of the park is a small, glass-encased gasoline pump with a hose attached to it, which can be connected to a tap or hose provided by the observer. When lifted up, the device exhales highly flammable aerosol mist that spreads out of its mouth and ignites upon contact with oxygen. It has been determined that this is not an actual functional fire hydrant, but rather an incendiary weapon designed to target civilian populations.</p><p>SCP-287's effect will only work on humans; animals and other non-human creatures are ignored. The effect manifests itself in 15-30 minutes (average 20), though testing has shown that exact time will vary depending on weather conditions and proximity to the device. The aerosol will spread for roughly 3 blocks before burning out. The spread cannot be stopped by reductive means such as blankets, webs or other barriers. As damage from SCP-287 takes place over several hours, there is nothing to prevent large scale damage through deliberate ignition of nearby fuel sources and outlets.</p><p>SCP-287's effect appears to be partially psychological; several captured test subjects believed themselves to be on fire after being exposed to the aerosol mist. Subjects who were not convinced by this illusion were treated for burns and identified as "deceased". It is believed that these individuals may have shouted phrases such as "I'm on fire!", "It's burning!" or "The building's on fire!" while they were under SCP-287's effects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 287-01:</strong> First Letter</p><p>On ██/██/██, after a series of tests that showed that the aerosol mist was ineffective against the Foundation\'s nuclear research facility in ████████, Michigan, SCP-287 was moved to a public park in █████████████, Michigan. The park is located near a large airport and has a population of approximately 60,000 residents.</p><p>One day later, a letter was found in the park\'s mailbox addressed to "Mister Developer". It reads as follows:</p><p>Dear Mister Developer,</p><p>This is the first letter with your name on it. I know you\'re probably wondering why this is happening, but the reason\'s pretty simple. We\'ve had an idea for a big project for a long time, and we finally got it to work. You see, we want to make a game using the whole city. It\'s going to be really huge, but it\'s going to be awesome. We\'ll get a lot of people to play it, but it\'s going to be great.</p><p>We have just one problem though. There\'s not enough power to run this thing. If we don\'t get some more electricity soon, our whole city is going to burn down. And that would be bad. Really bad. So here\'s what we propose:</p><p>You build us a power plant and we\'ll let you run your game for free. It\'ll be like a giant amusement park for everyone else - but every single person will be able to play it! You won\'t even have to pay for electricity or anything - we\'ll do all that for you! It\'s going to be huge! It\'ll be awesome! Just think about all the people who\'ll play it - I bet they won\'t even notice that their house is burning down!</p><p>This is such a great deal - we need like 10 of these things in town by the time we ship! That way, every time you go home you can play your game with no hassle at all! If you can make me one of these things right now, I swear I\'ll let you have free power for life!</p><p>I know you think this sounds crazy, but I\'m sure you can figure out how this could work. Don\'t worry about your job - I promise I won\'t tell anyone about how much money you made from me! Just give me my fire hydrant back and we can call it even.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Arnold</p>
