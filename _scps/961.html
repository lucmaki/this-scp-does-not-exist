<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-961</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-961 is to be kept under observation in its room. Only D-class personnel are permitted access to the object's chamber.</p><p>SCP-961 may not be removed from its containment unless it is secured by a researcher with Level 2 or higher security clearance. If a researcher has not been assigned to SCP-961, no personnel may enter its chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-961 is a plain curtain from a local theatre. The curtain's last performance was in the play "Lobster Cove" in ███████, England, on ██/██/19██.</p><p>When any person touches SCP-961, they will disappear. This effect will last for approximately five (5) minutes before ending abruptly, with no trace of the subject's remains being present.</p><p>SCP-961 was recovered by Mobile Task Force Delta-6 ("Black Cats") after several reports of townsfolk vanishing. Foundation agents posing as MTF agents interrogated ██ witnesses while several Class D personnel (including an agent disguised as a tree) observed the event. When questioned about their sudden disappearance, eyewitnesses claimed that they had been handcuffed to their chairs, and then "thrown out the window", leading to their apparent demise.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/20██, SCP-961 was transported to Site 16 when an incident caused multiple objects in the site's basement to disappear. This included several SCP artifacts, a mass of SCP-2710 and several other items.", 'Addendum: On ██/██/20██, SCP-961 was removed from its containment after several research staff at Site 16 reported missing. While initially disputed as a hoax, Foundation agents infiltrated the facility mentioned in the report and discovered that several researchers had been handcuffed to their chairs, and then "thrown out the window". As a precautionary measure, all researchers at Site 16 were to be temporarily suspended until further notice.</p>
