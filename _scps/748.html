<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-748</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-748 is to be contained in a windowless room in Section 3 of Site-77. The room is furnished with an armchair, table, bed and dresser. SCP-748 is to be fed on a regular basis. All personnel are required to report for psychological testing at least once every six months to determine whether or not they have been affected by SCP-748's anomalous effects. The pieces of paper from which SCP-748 receives its information should be kept under high security lock and key until the end of each test.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-748 is a humanoid being approximately 2.5 metres in height, which communicates telepathically with all Foundation personnel who are placed in the room. SCP-748 is intelligent, but not sapient; it has demonstrated no ability to reason or make inferences. Communication between SCP-748 and any person's mind is only possible if that person holds a piece of paper in his or her hand while they are in the same room as SCP-748. The content of these papers varies from subject to subject, but always contains an idea or experience that the subject would like to share with others. These papers are acquired through an anomalous process, and most subjects report feeling an internal compulsion to acquire one of these papers on a regular basis. Subjects have reported that the papers seem to come from elsewhere, but this cannot be confirmed.</p><p>SCP-748 will only accept papers from within its personal field of view, and if more than one person is present in the room at the same time (subjects report varying amounts of preference for specific individuals), SCP-748 will choose to communicate with one individual over any other based on which individual holds one of these papers. Individuals who hold pieces of paper taken by SCP-748 begin immediately after acquisition to receive direct telepathic communication from SCP-748, and describe this communication as "intense", "concentrated" and "passionate".</p><p>Telepathic communication between SCP-748 and subjects is extremely limited; all communication revolves around thoughts related to ideas contained in the paper held by the subject at the time of acquisition. In order for SCP-748 to communicate with a subject, the latter must voluntarily place the paper into his or her hand. SCP-748 will not communicate with subjects who refuse to do so, regardless of whether or not they are holding any other piece of paper. Subjects who hold other pieces of paper at the same time that they hold SCP-748's will cease receiving telepathic communication from SCP-748.</p><p>Communication with subjects via telepathy with SCP-748 is only possible when both parties are holding pieces of paper at the time of acquisition. If both parties dispose of their pieces before they have been able to exchange them, communication ceases until another piece is acquired. If a subject attempts to dispose of their paper without having first acquired it, they will feel intense irritation and pressure to return it to SCP-748 immediately. This sensation does not last long because subjects believe that it is impossible for them to disconnect from SCP-748 in such a manner.</p><p>As soon as a piece of paper has been acquired by any subject, it becomes available for use by all Foundation personnel who work within Site-77's boundaries. All Foundation personnel receive telepathic communication from SCP-748 repeatedly; there appears to be no limit on how many times each piece can be used for this purpose. The effects of acquiring multiple pieces of paper increase in severity depending on how many pieces are acquired simultaneously and/or how many people are present in the room when it occurs.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
