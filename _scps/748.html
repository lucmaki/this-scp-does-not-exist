<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-748</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-748 is to be contained in a windowless room in Section 3 of Site-77. The room is furnished with an armchair, table, bed and dresser. SCP-748 is to be fed on a regular basis. All personnel are required to report for psychological testing at least once every six months to determine whether or not they have been affected by SCP-748's anomalous effects. The pieces of paper from which SCP-748 receives its information should be kept under high security lock and key until the end of each test.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-748 is a humanoid being approximately 2.5 metres in height, which communicates telepathically with all Foundation personnel who are placed in the room. SCP-748 is intelligent, but not sapient; it has demonstrated no ability to reason or make inferences. Communication between SCP-748 and any person's mind is only possible if that person holds a piece of paper in his or her hand while they are in the same room as SCP-748. The content of these papers varies from subject to subject, but always contains an idea or experience that the subject would like to share with others. These papers are acquired through an anomalous process, and most subjects report feeling an internal compulsion to acquire one of these papers on a regular basis. Subjects have reported that the papers seem to come from elsewhere, but this cannot be confirmed.</p><p>SCP-748 will only accept papers from within its personal field of view, and if more than one person is present in the room at the same time (subjects report varying amounts of preference for specific individuals), SCP-748 will choose to communicate with one individual over any other based on which individual holds one of these papers. Individuals who hold pieces of paper taken by SCP-748 begin immediately after acquisition to receive direct telepathic communication from SCP-748, and describe this communication as "intense", "concentrated" and "passionate".</p><p>Telepathic communication between SCP-748 and subjects is extremely limited; all communication revolves around thoughts related to ideas contained in the paper held by the subject at the time of acquisition. In order for SCP-748 to communicate with a subject, the latter must voluntarily place the paper into his or her hand. SCP-748 will not communicate with subjects who refuse to do so, regardless of whether or not they are holding any other piece of paper. Subjects who hold other pieces of paper at the same time that they hold SCP-748's will cease receiving telepathic communication from SCP-748.</p><p>Communication with subjects via telepathy with SCP-748 is only possible when both parties are holding pieces of paper at the time of acquisition. If both parties dispose of their pieces before they have been able to exchange them, communication ceases until another piece is acquired. If a subject attempts to dispose of their paper without having first acquired it, they will feel intense irritation and pressure to return it to SCP-748 immediately. This sensation does not last long because subjects believe that it is impossible for them to disconnect from SCP-748 in such a manner.</p><p>As soon as a piece of paper has been acquired by any subject, it becomes available for use by all Foundation personnel who work within Site-77's boundaries. All Foundation personnel receive telepathic communication from SCP-748 repeatedly; there appears to be no limit on how many times each piece can be used for this purpose. The effects of acquiring multiple pieces of paper increase in severity depending on how many pieces are acquired simultaneously and/or how many people are present in the room when it occurs.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-748 was originally discovered in 19██, when the Foundation received an anonymous tip reporting an anomalous phenomenon occurring within the basement of a building located in ██████, ██████. A Foundation agent disguised as a representative of the local police arrived on scene and questioned several people present in the house concerning the cause of the ruckus; subjects claimed to have been observing SCP-748 acting strangely. The anomalous entity was captured by Foundation agents and placed into Containment Protocol 748.</p><p>During a routine psychological test conducted by Dr. Irons, one of the subjects lost his ability to hold paper for any length of time without experiencing nausea and intense discomfort. He became extremely upset when he was told that he had lost his ability to perceive SCP-748, and expressed a desire to see Dr. Irons as soon as possible. When asked why he felt this way, he said that he "knew things" from SCP-748 that "I have never known from any other source". Another subject was not affected at all by the loss of the ability to perceive SCP-748; she refused to answer Dr. Irons\' questions about her reaction to being unable to contact SCP-748, stating that she "loved [Dr. Irons] too much" and "[did not] want to upset [him]" unless they were alone together.</p><p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Dr. Irons was found dead in his private quarters, apparently having taken his own life. The police were unable to find any evidence of an intruder, so they speculated that Dr. Irons committed suicide since he "just felt like it". The investigation did not reveal anything from the scientists\' side of the room, and cell surveillance indicated that both SCP-748 and Dr. Irons died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound within 30 minutes of each other.</p>
