<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-724</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-724 is to be contained under a standard Safe-class object locker within Site-77, with a minimum of three automated guards assigned at all times. This object is not to be opened except in the event of emergency, or following an emergency containment breach. During an emergency containment breach, SCP-724 is to be incinerated immediately and all personnel are to shelter-in-place until the emergency passes. Autonomous sentry robots have been set up in the vicinity for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-724 is a gas-filled cavern located within Site-77, measuring approximately 20 m in width and length. This chamber contains a highly pressurized source of natural gas, with readings taken from the source exceeding ███████ atmospheres. The exact source of SCP-724's gas is unknown, but it has been preliminarily identified as originating from a subterranean chamber that correlates with SCP-714. Testing notes have indicated that the connection between SCP-714 and SCP-714-2 runs through this cavern, so far as indications can be made of its origin.</p><p>SCP-724 differs from other gas chambers in that an anomalous heat has been noted to emanate from its walls. It also has no apparent ventilation or chemical sources of combustion, though these may have been blocked off through unknown means.</p><p>The area directly surrounding SCP-724 appears to be sentient; five instances of SCP-727 have been recorded. These entities are reported to be highly intelligent and capable of speech, though with difficulty at times (due to their organic nature). Furthermore, all five instances possess the ability to move faster than normal by accelerating quickly towards the subject in question, then slowing down before reaching him/her; this effect seems to manifest itself regardless of whether the subject is moving away from or towards them. In addition, each instance will attempt to physically incapacitate any personnel within sight of it by striking various parts of its body with enough force to momentarily knock them unconscious. Although typically more resistant than humans due to their solid composition, each instance has proven vulnerable if struck on certain parts of their bodies (e.g., eyes) or if a large portion of their body becomes exposed to open air at unreasonable speeds (e.g., eyes when they are thrown into a room while being accelerated towards the subject they are intended to incapacitate).</p><p>When an instance is incapacitated, it will attempt to flee as far away as possible while losing consciousness slowly over time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-724 was discovered on ██/██/2000 when a security camera malfunctioned, causing the live feed of Site-77 to be displayed on a monitor located within the project's containment office. The feed showed a human male standing in the center of SCP-714-2, surrounded by five instances of SCP-727. This individual was subsequently identified as [REDACTED], a site security guard with no prior knowledge of the existence of SCP-714 or SCP-714-2.</p><p>The following log was recovered from a computer connected to the camera, and is believed to have been written by [REDACTED]</p><p>I'm not sure what's going on here, but I can't just sit here and do nothing. If you guys are watching this, I'm going to make a break for it. I can't let those things get me. If I lose consciousness and don't wake up again when they're done with me, at least he won't have to watch.</p><p>He's right there; I'm not safe if he's out there, too. He's got his back to me, but he can't see what's coming, and he's too far away to get help. If I run as fast as I can, I can get to him; that way, at least someone will be able to help him.</p><p>I can't let him die alone like that.</p><p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>
