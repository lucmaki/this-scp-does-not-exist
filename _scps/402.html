<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-402</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-402 is to be contained in a Containment Vault at Site-19. During testing, SCP-402 is to be restrained in an Iso-Perch harness and held on the subject's left hand. Under no circumstances is any object less than 4 cm tall to be brought into direct contact with SCP-402.</p><p>Unwanted subjects who accidentally come in contact with SCP-402 are to be sheltered until medical assistance arrives. Any human exposed to SCP-402 may not be regained without first being decontaminated and amnesticized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-402 is a male yellow-green parrot (Amazonetta plumbea) weighing approximately 1.5 kg. SCP-402 is capable of vocalization in at least five languages, but primarily speaks English. Though initially believed to be a member of the genus Amazona, testing has shown that SCP-402 cannot speak in any species other than Amazona, possibly due to brain trauma sustained during its containment.</p><p>When in the presence of an individual who believes that it is "raining", SCP-402 will vocalize differently than it normally would, instead imitating the sound of raindrops striking surfaces (SCP-403). The severity and duration of this effect varies from test subject to test subject; subjects reporting different sensations from normal rain include:</p><p>Contact with SCP-402 or any object bearing its likeness, regardless of size, will result in the affected subject developing severe anxiety, accompanied by severe physical ailments such as:</p><p>SCP-402's containment chamber bears a plaque bearing the text "The One Who Knows" with an image of SCP-402 beneath it, along with several other plaques bearing various phrases and images relating to anomalous entities and religions.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-402\'s anomalous properties were first discovered during a containment breach at ██████ ████████, where SCP-402 was found after escaping from its cage. Witnesses described the area around SCP-402 as having become "shiny" and "glittering", and all witnesses recalled the sound of rain. After discovering SCP-402 in the containment chamber, security personnel reported having experienced an identical sensation to that experienced by the heads of the original witnesses.</p><p>Upon recovering SCP-402, several plaques bearing images and phrases relating to other anomalous entities were found attached to its cage. The following are the plaques found on SCP-402\'s cage:</p>
