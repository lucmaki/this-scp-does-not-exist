<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-106</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-106 is to be stored in an airtight steel container, located within a refrigerated vault at Site-██. SCP-106 is to be kept under observation at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-106 refers to a pair of large, amorphous gray objects approximately 1 m in length and 0.9 m in diameter, which move slowly and aggressively towards other substances. When SCP-106 comes into contact with a solid, it begins to consume the substance, using absorbed matter as energy to extend itself further. When SCP-106 is unable to absorb any more matter, it will create two new openings (referred to as "mouths") and attempt to expand from there.</p><p>When introduced to various liquids or solids, SCP-106 will begin consuming the liquid or solid with its mouths; if one of these openings is blocked off or sealed shut, SCP-106 is incapable of movement for a period of time equal to the length of the remaining opening. As SCP-106 expands and consumes material, its mass increases significantly, with growth occurring at an exponential rate when extended. If SCP-106 is not able to complete an expansion within 20 hours after initial contact with a solid or liquid, it will temporarily lose its ability to act as an individual object until such time as a new opening has been created; if this occurs while SCP-106 is located within an active Foundation containment unit, then it will be safely contained inside that container.</p><p>SCP-106 has no permanent form when mobile; instead it will move constantly around in search of more food sources. It displays no interest in human beings except during feeding times; when not actively eating, SCP-106 seems completely oblivious towards human beings unless they come into contact with it.</p><p>SCP-106 was recovered from the ██████ Hyenas' enclosure at Site-██ on ██/██/22██ at 9:00 AM local time; upon discovery, containment guards reported observing several members of the hyenas being devoured by the object. The substance was taken into Foundation custody shortly after but was not initially identified as anomalous; research began only after ██████ Hyenas were found missing from their enclosure and had been presumed eaten by SCP-106.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong> On ██/██/22██, SCP-106\'s containment unit was breached by several SCP-106 "young", which had been recently born. As of the time of writing this, no further instances of SCP-106 have been discovered.']</p>
