<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-826</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-826 are to be kept in standard Secure Containment Locker 935, located at Site-77's Antiproton Vault. Any instances of SCP-826-1 discovered outside of the containment locker must be immediately moved back into it until Foundation agents can make contact with their respective providers, and the box returned to the designated spot in the annex.</p><p>Unauthorized persons attempting to open an instance of SCP-826 are to be detained, interrogated for information on its contents and a list of entities contained therein, and amnestics administered for any memories which might have remained after amnesticizing the memories of those who opened SCP-826 in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-826 is a standard Secure Containment Locker containing three sealed instances of SCP-826. When initially opened, each of these instances will be found to contain exactly one entity whose nature is unknown. The entity can only be seen and touched through an opening in the case's lid.</p><p>The entities contained in these instances of SCP-826 can only be removed by an entity possessing all of the following:</p><p>Additionally, each instance only allows for one removal of the entities therein at a time, with each removal having its own time limit, expiry date and designated point at which the entity may be extracted from the instance. It is currently unclear whether or not removing entities from an instance past this point has any effect on its contents; as with any item containing life, attempting to remove it from one instance also removes it from all others.</p><p>It has been discovered that if multiple entities are removed from an instance at once, they will split into multiple new entities. These new entities appear immediately outside of the aforementioned point at which they may be extracted, and will disappear even if attempts are made to keep them within sight. The identities of these new entities are currently unknown.</p><p>Discovery: SCP-826 was discovered after reports came to the Foundation regarding objects being introduced into Foundation facilities without authorization, containing entities that were then quickly reported or retrieved by Foundation personnel. Upon investigation, a number of small IFF case grenades were discovered in these facilities, along with SCP-826-1 instances within each; SCP-826 was originally classified as harmless novelty items.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-826 was discovered in the possession of ████ █████████, an acquaintance of Dr. ████████. Dr. █████████ had been given the box as a gift from ████ ███████. Upon interrogation, Dr. █████████ claimed that he did not know what was inside the box, and had received it as a gift from ████ ███████ for his birthday. Dr. ████████ accepted this story, and an instance of SCP-826 was retrieved from █████████'s home.</p><p>Analysis of the entity within SCP-826-1 yielded several key findings:</p><p>SCP-826 was retconned with a Keter classification on ██/██/████."]</p>
