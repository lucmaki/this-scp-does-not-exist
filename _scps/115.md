<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-115</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-115 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. Viewing of SCP-115 is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher. Description and usage of SCP-115 is restricted to researchers with clearance 4/120.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-115 is an 18 cm x 28 cm wooden box consisting of three compartments, each containing a piece of paper with an inscription. SCP-115 was recovered from the home of John ██████ (deceased) in ████ and confiscated by the Foundation after his death.</p><p>If one attempts to open SCP-115, they will hear a "beating heart" (see Addendum 115-1). Attempting to open SCP-115 causes the object to rotate on its axis and thereby forcing it to close. According to Mr. ██████, this noise is generated when SCP-115's hinges are forcibly made contact with one another. When SCP-115 has closed, the sound ceases.</p><p>Opening SCP-115 while closed causes the object to rotate counterclockwise and make a "thumping" noise along with what appears to be blood rivulets along the sides of the box. When the lid opens fully, researchers are greeted by a large amount of blood and what appears to be fused organs.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 115-1:</strong> D-4746, a D-Class subject, was instructed to open SCP-115 and observe its contents. D-4746 complied, and upon opening SCP-115, he reported hearing "a beating heart." After observing the organ, which appeared to have been fused together, he reported that it "smelled like a piece of grass".</p><p>SCP-115 was then examined by an attending physician, Dr. ████████, who found that the organ did not have any bones or internal organs. The organ was then immediately surgically removed for use in experimentation.</p><p>D-4746 was then instructed to close SCP-115, and upon doing so he heard a "thumping" noise along with what appeared to be blood rivulets along the sides of the box. Attempting to open the box again resulted in it rotating and closing on its own accord. When questioned about this activity, D-4746 reported feeling "warmth" inside his chest.']</p>
