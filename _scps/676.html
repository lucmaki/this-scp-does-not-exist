<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-676</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> One (1)instance of SCP-676 is currently contained at Site-17 for analysis and containment. This instance is to be provided with the basic amenities required for a humanoid's subsistence, such as a nutritious diet, clean water, and suitable clothing. Should any violation of containment occur, an on-site physician may be called upon to provide emergency care. In all other cases, the affected individual is allowed to return to their own duties or go home following treatment.</p><p>Any newly discovered instances of SCP-676 are to be contained as soon as possible after discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-676 is the designation given to an individual of either gender, aged between thirty and fifty, with a history of not suffering any major injuries or illness prior to their discovery. SCP-676 apparitions are extremely intelligent, retaining full control of their bodies despite appearing in a non-corporeal state. They will typically refuse medical treatment for minor injuries and illnesses, insisting that no serious situation exists. When being examined by doctors, they display extraordinary knowledge of human physiology and have been known to diagnose medical conditions perfectly accurate for the time period during which it was observed. The SCP account for this ability is unknown at this time; however, it is hypothesized that SCP-676 maintains some form of mental connection with their body upon entering a non-corporeal state.</p><p>Upon entering a new location, SCP-676 will begin the process of finding its way home, or attempting to find a suitable "unfinished business" location to return to. The concept of returning home has been thoroughly explored by SCP-676 so far; however, they have not yet discovered a means of achieving this goal as of writing this document. They usually perform tasks such as trying to scam money from local establishments or charities, doing small tasks like creating artwork or organizing mailings for organizations they do not identify as associated with themselves in advance.</p><p>Foundations currently contain over eleven hundred instances of SCP-676, which were initially discovered after several reports were filed regarding identical individuals claiming they were home while not existing anywhere on the map. In addition to those brought back to Earth from various extraterrestrial locations, approximately three hundred instances have been recovered from Foundation facilities such as Project: Blue Book, Area-11 attempting to enter other containment sites and/or escape entirely when an instance was taken by agents unaware of their anomalous nature as well as Dimensional Containment Site-87 where SCP objects are contained in order to prevent anyone other than authorized personnel from gaining access.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum: SCP-676-1:</strong> On September 9th, 20██, an unidentified individual claiming to be an instance of SCP-676 was reported to have escaped from a Foundation facility in the city of [REDACTED] in [REDACTED]. The foundation was notified that an individual was spotted in the area multiple times over the course of several days. Upon investigation, Foundation agents discovered mailboxes belonging to a deceased individual located in the residence where the SCP-676 instance claimed to reside. The mailboxes were empty and no identification cards, property records, or other forms of identification were recovered from the residence.</p><p>The Foundation personnel who discovered and investigated this location were unaware they had been compromised by an SCP-676 instance at the time. To date, no information has surfaced regarding this individual or their current status, nor is any method of tracing them currently known.']</p>
