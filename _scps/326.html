<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-326</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-326 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber, with all other object classes. SCP-326's cage must be at least 2 meters in length and 1 meter in depth, lined with animal-proofing material. All openings to the cage are to be covered with plexiglass or similar material for the purpose of preventing escapes. A pair of motion detectors are to be placed on opposite ends of the room from the main door, one facing inside and the other facing out. Should SCP-326 enter its containment chamber without permission, an alarm will sound inside the site security office and immediate quarantine procedures will be instituted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-326 is a Caucasian male, measuring 1.8 meters in height. SCP-326 possesses the natural ability to fly, utilizing membrane wings similar to those found on bats. SCP-326's appearance and ability to change between human and bat forms has not been altered by the site's anomalous properties. Subject wears clothing resembling various branches of the military branch of its native country, but varies in color and design with each new form.</p><p>SCP-326 is able to alter its form at will. This ability has been observed in three separate experiments, which have produced differing results in regards to subject's abilities. All tests were performed within the confines of Site-██, with all entrances to the site sealed off from other areas of the Foundation.</p><p>Test Log:</p><p>Subject was able to reproduce one of its forms into an identical specimen as a test using two other similarly sized subjects. The results of this test were inconclusive as no data was collected during testing and in order for the test to succeed, subjects had to be located during their "bat" phase of existence before attempting to return them to their humanoid form.</p><p>NOTE: Subject is currently under Foundation care after having eaten the arm that contained motion detector inside the containment booth that locked it into a room with only one possible exit. Surveillance footage showed subject diving under table after noticing motion detector alerting other personnel present that SCP-326 was in containment room #███. Subject later reemerged from under table and left containment room through door opposite side of containment measures leading back into facility.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-326 and the other humanoid anomalies contained in Site-██ were contained by the Foundation after being reported as missing on ██/██/████. Letters found in the possession of the former head caretaker of Site-██ explained that the facility was not abandoned, but rather contained an "extraterrestrial life form". The letters continued to give instructions on how to maintain the site, with a timetable for completion, stating that the facility would only be abandoned if it was deemed unfit to continue its mission by its higher ups.</p><p>After investigation, evidence was found suggesting that the former head carekeeper was being coerced into destroying all documents related to SCP-326 and its containment process, as well as any other documents that could potentially allow for future identification of SCP-326. Investigation is continuing.</p>
