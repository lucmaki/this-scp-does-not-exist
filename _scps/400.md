<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-400</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutral</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-400 is to be contained in an anomalous space within a storage locker. It has been theorised that the space contained by SCP-400 was created when its antimemetic properties were first discovered and contained, thus creating a space within which matter may be stored and transported without commingling with that matter. As such, all physical interaction with SCP-400 is to be conducted through the use of a specially- constructed box for taking measurements. For transporting, SCP-400 is to be contained in one of nine identical quantities of cylinders of 36 cm diameter, 2 cm wall thickness, 12.5 cm long, and weighing 166 kg each.</p><p>All testing on SCP-400 is subject to the current Ethics Committee guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-400 is a set of nine black steel cabinets, each marked with the numbers 400-399. The apotheosis of these cabinets is its antimemetic properties, which are known to prevent any external interaction with them, including observation and recording of the contents. A measurement made on one of these cabinets either causes the measurement taken to become invalid when not quantified by another measurement, or creates an entirely new set of measurements that agree with that measurement.</p><p>Note-based testing has yet to continue past level 0 in this scale.</p><p>In addition to these anomalous properties, SCP-400 possesses all physical properties typical for a set of 36 cm diameter steel units weighing 2 cm wall thickness. Testing on the density of these units does not result in any change in mass. SCP-400's antimemetic properties imply that it is constructed of a special alloy designed specifically to be unaffected by ordinary matter; intentional attempts at removing SCP-400 from this space have so far failed without detection.</p><p>SCP-400 was discovered when personnel were sent to investigate a rumbling noise coming from within one of the cabinets. Upon investigation, they found an infohazardous patch affixed to the surface of the cabinet, with instructions in Norwegian; this was determined to be an ancient instruction manual for maintenance and repair of the cabinet and its components. Following this discovery and investigation (which uncovered two additional boxes containing 464 similar manuals), SCP-400 was assigned Neutralisation Class 3 and established as part of Containment Area 12 ("The Climate Containment Area") at Site-██.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum-400.1:</strong> On 05/20/96, SCP-400 was extracted from its anomalous space through the use of a specially constructed box for taking measurements. This procedure caused the antimemetic properties of one of the cabinets to be temporarily suspended, and the contents of that cabinet to be observed. The results were transmitted to Site-██ by experimental radio, in the form of a single message.</p><p>The following is a transcript of that message.</p><p>Test 400-2</p><p>The following is a transcript of the message received by Site-██ when SCP-400 was extracted from its anomalous space by placing it inside a specially constructed box for taking measurements.</p><p>Passing.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. Bright:</strong> What does this mean?</p><p><End Log></p><p>At 00:05 on 05/25/96, SCP-400 was extracted from its anomalous space using a portable compression device designed for handling and storing antimemetic containers; the change in antimemetic properties created an infohazardous patch on the container containing SCP-400 and caused a significant portion of the unit's antimemetic properties to be transferred to SCP-400 itself."]</p>
