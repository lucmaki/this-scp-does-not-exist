<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-49</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-49 is to be contained in a standard containment cell within Site-19. At no time is the use of SCP-49 to draw outside of containment to be permitted. No exceptions.</p><p>If any personnel are found to employed by SCP-49, they will be terminated immediately. Any personnel caught attempting to employ SCP-49 outside of this procedure will also be terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-49 is a standard wooden pencil, approximately 12â€³ in length. Despite its anomalous properties, it is physically identical to a standard pencil. SCP-49 has the ability to imbue drawings with a small amount of extra color and detail not normally present within them. The colors and details are consistent when SCP-49 is used to draw within a specific time-frame between 1 and 24 hours.</p><p>SCP-49 will only be used for drawing and no other purpose. This includes, but is not limited to, writing or even using it as an implement for signing one's name.</p><p>Once these restrictions have been met, any drawing made by SCP-49 will reflect all colors present within the subject's perception of colors - however these colors will appear slightly out of place when compared to those that could normally exist in real life. For example, an orange red would appear as pink, yellow would seem green and so on.</p><p>Once inside the containment cell, SCP-49 will continue to draw as before until it's allowed outside again. Once outside, it will stop drawing until another subject (or objects) picks up the pencil and begins drawing again. Any other non-living object that comes into contact with the drawing created by SCP-49 will display an identical phenomenon; if 4 or more people create drawings while inside containment, they are expected to contain all colors present within the subject's perception of colors. The coloring system used by SCP-49 is similar yet different from that used by the human eye.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 49-1:</strong></p><p>SCP-49 was discovered following 2 incidents that occurred within Site-19. The first incident involved a containment breach during which SCP-49 was stolen. A security guard had been assigned to the area in which SCP-49 was located. However, on this day, the guard was caught napping and the object was able to be removed from its location. Upon removal, the object began drawing on the guard's uniform and was easily able to remove it without harm.</p><p>The second incident occurred when a security breach was detected while SCP-49 was being stored in its cell. The object was moved to a nearby room and placed into a containment unit. This time, the object began drawing on the floor and rapidly drew an image of a blindfold on the floor. After approximately ten minutes, the object had drawn an intricate symbol of a crescent moon with a line coming out of it. The symbol seemed to be carved into the floor itself. Any human who came into contact with the symbol began to see colors that appeared as if they were being drawn into their vision. The colors were always bright and very vivid; however, they were noticeably different from those that could normally exist in reality.</p>
