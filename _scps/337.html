<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-337</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-337 is to be kept in an airtight storage locker in a standard Foundation containment cell. Access to SCP-337 is restricted to Level 4 personnel only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-337 is a Yixing clay teapot.</p><p>SCP-337 displays no anomalous properties until it is used to make tea. When used in this way, SCP-337 will grow hair at a rate of 4 cm per hour. After this growth has ceased, the hair will remain intact and can be removed.</p><p>The hair will grow back in approximately 24 hours, with roughly half of the new hairs being black. The color of the remaining hairs can vary, with shades ranging from white to dark brown.</p><p>SCP-337 was recovered from Location ██ after it began manifesting these properties on ██/██/2006 without any known cause. At this time, an individual known as [REDACTED] claimed ownership of the teapot and threatened to file an insurance claim on behalf of the Chinese Tea Association if the object was not returned. The Foundation was able to coerce her into assisting them in recovery efforts.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
