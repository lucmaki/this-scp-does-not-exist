<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-337</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-337 is to be kept in an airtight storage locker in a standard Foundation containment cell. Access to SCP-337 is restricted to Level 4 personnel only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-337 is a Yixing clay teapot.</p><p>SCP-337 displays no anomalous properties until it is used to make tea. When used in this way, SCP-337 will grow hair at a rate of 4 cm per hour. After this growth has ceased, the hair will remain intact and can be removed.</p><p>The hair will grow back in approximately 24 hours, with roughly half of the new hairs being black. The color of the remaining hairs can vary, with shades ranging from white to dark brown.</p><p>SCP-337 was recovered from Location ██ after it began manifesting these properties on ██/██/2006 without any known cause. At this time, an individual known as [REDACTED] claimed ownership of the teapot and threatened to file an insurance claim on behalf of the Chinese Tea Association if the object was not returned. The Foundation was able to coerce her into assisting them in recovery efforts.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/2006, a note was found inside the teapot, which reads as follows:</p><p>I know you're out there. I've been waiting for you. You think you're so clever, but you're not. You don't even realize that this is my way of showing you who's won.</p><p>I've already got what I wanted. Give me back my pot and I'll get it back to you.</p><p>You can keep your money.</p><p>- The Teapot's Owner</p>
