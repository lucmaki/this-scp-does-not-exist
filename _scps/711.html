<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-711</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-711 is to be contained in a standard containment cell at Site-17. SCP-711 is to be kept at least 1m away from the nearest door or wall. It is not to be moved via its anomalous effect until a suitable object has been located and moved within the cell. Once an object has been found, it is not to be moved despite the anomalous properties of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-711 is a rectangular black box. The top of the box is stylized as a dial with two black buttons on either side of it. When SCP-711 is observed, whoever is observing it will be able to hear everything occurring within the box. The person will also be able to see whatever objects are within the room that SCP-711 is not in, although this effect will not last long enough for anyone to reach the room or exit.</p><p>In addition, when an object exits the room, any observers will be able to hear what is going on with those objects. In most cases they can even see what is happening with them. A few objects will have much less nuance to their message, but even these make their intentions obvious. For example, if a person is watching a television set, they will be able to hear every word of whatever program they are watching. If an owner enters the room while they are watching, they will still be able to hear what is happening on the TV, as well as every word said by both the owner and anyone else in the room, regardless of distance. It should also be noted that if any effort is made whatsoever to prevent someone from hearing anything in SCP-711, no one outside SCP-711 would ever receive any information about it.</p><p>SCP-711 was recovered from ████████, Texas after reports of several suicides were made by residents there, who claimed that their only motivation was a voice telling them this was the best thing for them.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
