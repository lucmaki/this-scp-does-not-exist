<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-711</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-711 is to be contained in a standard containment cell at Site-17. SCP-711 is to be kept at least 1m away from the nearest door or wall. It is not to be moved via its anomalous effect until a suitable object has been located and moved within the cell. Once an object has been found, it is not to be moved despite the anomalous properties of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-711 is a rectangular black box. The top of the box is stylized as a dial with two black buttons on either side of it. When SCP-711 is observed, whoever is observing it will be able to hear everything occurring within the box. The person will also be able to see whatever objects are within the room that SCP-711 is not in, although this effect will not last long enough for anyone to reach the room or exit.</p><p>In addition, when an object exits the room, any observers will be able to hear what is going on with those objects. In most cases they can even see what is happening with them. A few objects will have much less nuance to their message, but even these make their intentions obvious. For example, if a person is watching a television set, they will be able to hear every word of whatever program they are watching. If an owner enters the room while they are watching, they will still be able to hear what is happening on the TV, as well as every word said by both the owner and anyone else in the room, regardless of distance. It should also be noted that if any effort is made whatsoever to prevent someone from hearing anything in SCP-711, no one outside SCP-711 would ever receive any information about it.</p><p>SCP-711 was recovered from ████████, Texas after reports of several suicides were made by residents there, who claimed that their only motivation was a voice telling them this was the best thing for them.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-711's anomalous properties have been used to great effect by the Foundation. Examples include:</p>
