<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-238</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All efforts to capture SCP-238 are to be ended immediately. Any still-floating or found instances of SCP-238 are to be retrieved and placed into storage.</p><p>Contact is to be maintained with local governments in case of potential sightings. In the event of an outbreak, Mobile Task Force Î»-10 ("Healing Care") is to be held at readiness at Site 19.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-238 is a phenomenon in which instances of SCP-238 spontaneously materialize and float through the air or ground. Instances are spherical and contain no discernible composition, but appear to be made of hardened biological fluids.</p><p>Cautionary notices must be posted on all buildings, vehicles, and objects where SCP-238 may be found.</p><p>Instances of SCP-238 typically appear near large groups of humanoid beings. Affected individuals report a strong desire to approach one of the organism's trailing tentacles, despite their medical condition. Affected parties will then attempt to climb onto the instance, stating that they feel compelled to do so. They proceed to explore the instance's interior, returning with small pieces of tissue. Affected victims will then attempt to consume the tissue themselves. Within hours, affected persons develop a permanent growth on a fingertip that they believe is part of their own body.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 238-1:</strong> The first known instance of SCP-238 was discovered when a group of fishermen saw a large starfish materialize in the middle of their fishing vessel. The instance's interior had been penetrated by several small, partially decomposed bodies of unknown origin. They were unable to escape this area of the ship until they reached land."]</p>
