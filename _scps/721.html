<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-721</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-721 is to be kept in a standard secure SCP object container at Site-66. The existence of SCP-721 and its contents are to be ineligible for inclusion in any Foundation database.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-721 is a cardboard box measuring 5.5×8.3×3.3 cm, containing a solitary (empty) pint glass on one of its sides. SCP-721 is made to resemble a popular brand of Canadian beer.</p><p>All attempts to open SCP-721 have resulted in it self-supporting itself, with no apparent use of anomalous means. Attempts to break open the box have also failed; SCP-721 has proven impervious to any amount of force or damage exerted upon it. A small slit in one side of the box has revealed an ink drawing that features a smiling man standing on a hill overlooking the ocean, with a hand extended toward the viewer and a caption reading "Captured". When tested on other people, this only results in the drawing changing to a single word: "You".</p><p>Should the glass within SCP-721 be emptied when not being observed, and replaced with another empty glass, the image will reappear on the box’s surface. After several days, however, it will vanish until further notice. If filled while being observed, however, the new image will vanish after two days and reform on its own if left alone for another two before appearing again if emptied again.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 721.1:</strong> Test Log</p><p>On ██/██/████, an agent of the Foundation was given a sample glass of SCP-721 to test (as the container had not been emptied within the past several days). The following is the entry to be made into his journal within 24 hours of the glass’s appearance on the box.</p><p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Glass appeared on the box</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████</p><p>At approximately 08:00, Agent █████ observed the words "You better not get drunk" written on the box’s surface.</p><p><strong>Day 2:</strong> Glass appeared on the box</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████</p><p>At 15:52, the words "You better not get drunk" were changed to "I’m gonna drink now" before disappearing from view. Agent █████ stated that he felt no compulsion to drink during this time.</p><p><strong>Day 3:</strong> Glass appeared on the box</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████</p><p>At 19:01, the words "I’m gonna drink now" were changed to "I’m gonna drink it all up" before disappearing from view. Agent █████ stated that he felt no compulsion to drink during this time.</p><p><strong>Day 4:</strong> Glass appeared on the box</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████</p><p>At 22:50, the words "I’m gonna drink it all up" were changed to "This one tastes great." before disappearing from view. Agent █████ stated that he felt no compulsion to drink during this time.</p><p><strong>Day 5:</strong> Glass appeared on the box</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████</p><p>At 00:20, the words "This one tastes great." were changed to "There\'s a party down at the beach". Agent █████ stated that he felt no compulsion to attend any parties during this time.</p><p><strong>Day 6:</strong> Glass appeared on the box</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/████</p><p>At 02:30, when Agent █████ was about to attempt to drink from it, he saw a blurred image of Site-66\'s coffee room before all writing disappeared from view, and a single word appeared instead: "Captured". Agent █████ reported that he had not yet decided whether or not he would attempt drinking from the glass.</p>
