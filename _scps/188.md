<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-188</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All direct visual observations of SCP-188 are to be recorded on video and audio cassette for future study. All copies of the video recordings have been altered to decrease the likelihood that any would be played in public.</p><p>Any individual exhibiting a cognizance of SCP-188’s physical presence is to be administered amnestics, regardless of their ability to recall details of the encounter. Displays of SCP-188 are to be monitored by Foundation agents posing as citizens of the affected areas. Any witnesses or witnesses’ family members who may be intent on contacting law enforcement are to be coerced into submission.</p><p>Any information relating to SCP-188’s appearance, behavior, or location is deemed top priority and is to be extracted from any willing personnel present.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-188 is a spherical, translucent entity approximately 20 meters in diameter. Despite the lack of photographic or recording evidence to verify its physical form, SCP-188 has been reported by observers as having heights between 7 and 8 meters and a circumference of up to 40 meters. Despite this, the surface area that can be seen from any given location is approximately 11 square meters. The ability of SCP-188 to move independently of this range indicates that it may not actually follow the same plane as the Earth.</p><p>SCP-188 has been described as displaying “meaningful” behavior in a majority of its interactions with human subjects. This behavior appears to be an attempt at communication, although no discernible meaning has been found in these actions alone. SCP-188 has displayed mobility as part of this behavior, but most individuals affected have been unable to recall what it was they saw when they first noticed movement.</p><p>The interaction with subjects varies greatly based on subject age and level of emotional maturity, although all witnesses have agreed that what they saw when SCP-188 interacted with them was abnormal, regardless of their personal emotional state during the encounter.</p><p>Interview 118-1: Excerpt:</p><p>Signed Interviewer: Dr. ██████</p><p>Interviewee: D-14959</p><p>Interviewed: D-14959, 18 years old</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Dr. ██████: You remember our conversation yesterday concerning the color pink?</p><p>D-14959: Yeah? Why are we talking about it again?</p><p>Dr. ██████: I need you to tell me about something that happened yesterday afternoon. It’s very important. Can you try to remember?</p><p>D-14959: Alright. I remember some dude was walking past and he was wearing a white T-shirt & pants combo… [Pause] A yellow shirt! I think it was yellow! He had brown hair and I could see his shadow on the wall behind him… He waved at me… Oh shit! Why are you making me remember this? He was just some guy!</p><p>Dr. ██████: What did he say when he waved at you? Try and concentrate… There’s nothing wrong with remembering things that happened yesterday if you don’t forget them, right?</p><p>D-14959: Ok. He said “Hey there yellowhead!” Or something like that…</p><p>Dr. ██████: Good boy! Now… Tell me about the color pink and how your friend reacted when you mentioned it was dangerous for him to get pink stuff from his dad’s closet.</p><p>D-14959: I can’t remember anything else from then… Wait… Fuck… It’s just not there anymore… Nothing except a light coming out from under his shirt and me seeing spots for a second before my eyes were back together. That’s all there is though… I swear! No one ever told me about how dangerous it is for anyone to play with pink stuff or why people should be afraid of pink! I didn’t even know what it was before yesterday, let alone anything else! How come no one ever tells kids about anything like this?! And why didn’t my parents tell me?! They should have told me!! If my mom gets upset because her closet isn’t getting cleaned up soon she can ask my dad to do it!!! Our clothes don't go near this fuckin' thing!! ARRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!! I don't wanna think about it anymore!! It's soooooo gross!! Just leave it alone already!? Ughhh!!!! Fucking AEGYPT FUCKIN' CARNY FUCKER!! You're always trying to make us think shit we ain't never gotta think about before! Just leave us alone already!! Why don't y'all just leave us alone anyways??!!!*[END LOG]</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-188 has been seen in the vicinity of ████████, █████ from approximately ██/██/████ to █/██/████. Witnesses have described many instances of SCP-188 moving within the area and stopping “near” a group of individuals. The group is reported to be engaging in “passionate” kissing and hugging, with several individuals touching and fondling each other. The individuals appear to be oblivious to the presence of their surroundings at all times, although they appear to be confused by the lack of any adult supervision or intervention.</p><p>While the exact purpose of SCP-188’s actions are unknown and no attempts to approach it have been successful, it is theorized that SCP-188 may be involved in some way in child sexual abuse. As such, any individuals who are discovered to have any knowledge of such activity are to be administered amnestics.']</p>
