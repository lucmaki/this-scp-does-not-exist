<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-132</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-132 is to be housed in a standard containment cell measuring 2 meters by 3.5 meters. At 3:58pm each day, a cover sheet with the following text is to be placed over the case's security camera lens and a stack of paper is to be placed beneath the lid:</p><p>Containment procedures are lax, as you all know there's nothing we can do about it. The Foundation has been unable to track down the sender or anything in the note other than the end of this Postscript.</p><p>Procedure A-105 "Chipping Away" is to be observed and carried out once every week.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-132 is a CD-Rom disc. It contains several pages of code, which can be easily deciphered by the human brain. Any attempt to do so causes severe pain in the part of the brain that is responsible for seeing and interpreting visual information.</p><p>SCP-132 was found in the possession of one Richard O'Barry, a corporate executive and "animal rights activist" living in ██████, England. O'Barry had described his work in Greenpeace as he was working on it from home.</p><p>On March 16th 1998, after having spent an hour deciphering blocks of text on SCP-132, O'Barry passed out and woke up later at [REDACTED], seriously injured by the loss of multiple fingers and eyesight in that eye. Having lost all sight in one eye, O'Barry had been using his other eye to read SCP-132's cryptic code. The damage had not occurred before this point in time. SCP-132 had been sent by postal mail from ████, Pennsylvania on February 22nd, 1998.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> During a routine review of O\'Barry\'s mail, Foundation agents discovered an envelope with the words "Use A Bag Of Chips To Reacher Out Cryptic Notes Back By CD-Rom Mail" written on it. The note inside the envelope read as follows:</p><p>Containment Procedures are lax, as you all know there\'s nothing you can do about it. The Foundation has been unable to track down the sender or anything in the note other than the end of this Postscript.</p><p>Procedure A-105 "Chipping Away" is to be observed and carried out once every week.</p><p>In addition, Foundation agents discovered an audio tape in O\'Barry\'s trash bin. It was labeled "Final Notice". It was not known what had been on the tape before O\'Barry had broken it.</p><p>Much later, it was discovered that O\'Barry had ordered his own execution by lethal injection. It was also discovered that he had bought approximately 8,000 copies of SCP-132 through mail order and distributed them to various groups and individuals throughout the world.']</p>
