<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-58</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-58 is to be kept in a standard storage locker, outfitted with humidification and built in water supply. Upon acquisition, SCP-58 is to be thoroughly researched for its appropriate containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-58 is a variety of ale brewed with SCP-707. SCP-58 has the consistency of normal beer and tastes indistinguishable from it, but contains hallucinogenic properties when consumed. Consumption removes the effects of SCP-707, leaving SCP-58 entirely tasteless, though prolonged exposure results in dizziness and nausea.</p><p>The beer became known as "Mr Fox Publish" after an incident where an investigator mistook the name for the result of a digital bar code reader for that of a pub crawl. Almost immediately upon consumption, an image of a fox appeared on the label. When asked about this, an employee responded that Mr Fox Publish was a typeface created by a previous owner, who had since passed away. Upon further questioning, employees revealed no ownership records and that they intended to replace it with another font once a replacement could be found.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 58-1:</strong> On 12/28/1995, Agent ████ informed staff that he had received a phone call from an individual claiming to be the former owner of SCP-58. The caller claimed that the beer was actually a typeface and that it should be replaced by a new font. The caller was given two options:</p><p>a) Replace Mr Fox Publish with SCP-58 or SCP-707</p><p>b) Replace SCP-58 with SCP-707</p><p>Agent ████ responded by asking if the owner would consider taking the beer off the market and making it available at a discounted rate. The caller agreed to this and hung up.</p><p>On 1/29/1996, after a discussion about the nature of SCP-58 produced no results, the drinking of SCP-58 by staff was prohibited.</p><p>On 2/6/1996, Agent ████ attempted to contact the owner of SCP-58. He called the number provided in an advertisement in the back page of ████████ Magazine and met with a woman who identified herself as "Mrs. ██████████." Mrs. ██████████ claimed to be the owner of SCP-58, though she would not answer any questions regarding its origin or history.</p><p>Mrs. ██████████ stated that she had bought the beer because she believed it to be a typeface and had intended to replace it with another one once she was able to find one. When asked why she had not done so, Mrs. ██████████ said that she had thought it would have been cheaper to purchase another one rather than sell it, but that upon discovering its properties, she decided to keep it as part of her collection. Mrs. ██████████ refused to make SCP-58 available for testing.']</p>
