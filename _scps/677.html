<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-677</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The corpse of SCP-677 is suspended by a cable from a noose and weighted to prevent movement. A planted transmitter inside the body allows for remote monitoring. A large portable incinerator is positioned outside the site of SCP-677's discovery to destroy any remains.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-677 is the human corpse of a male Caucasian man, approximately 35 years of age, who had been shot in the forehead with a .45 caliber pistol at point-blank range.</p><p>SCP-677 has a [DATA EXPUNGED]. Once per month, SCP-677 displays signs of disenchantment and anger towards the Foundation's continued containment of it. Internal injuries from this violence have been exacerbated by SCP-677's constant resistance.</p><p>SCP-477 appears to control SCP-677's body in some manner, preventing it from being destroyed. It has been reported that SCP-477 does not fully animate or possess SCP-677; instead, its consciousness seems to be deeply intertwined in its host's mind with an extent far beyond the mind of any other known entity. Its voice remains unclear, but brief experiences with auditory hallucinations indicate that it speaks in an old Scottish dialect. No person who has witnessed SCP-677 shows evidence of similar mental abnormalities after exposure to SCP-677.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong> SCP-677 (SCP-477) was discovered in the woods outside of [REDACTED] on [DATE EXPUNGED]. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate and contained the area following an investigation involving Mobile Task Force Omega-6 ("Primrose Glen") and Task Force Omicron-7 ("The Beast From Primrose Glen").</p>
