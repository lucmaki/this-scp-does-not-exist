<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-306</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The site of SCP-306 is currently empty, having been cleared in the late 1990s. For the purposes of this test, the area is to be occupied by a population of 50 stoats and made soundproof through the installation of additional walls on all sides. These walls are to be constructed from concrete, finished with a smooth coating of paint. The area is to be patrolled 24/7 by security personnel equipped with high-powered rifles.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-306 is the former residence of the infamous British scientist Dr. ██████ █████████, who used a variety of anomalous methods to create a perpetual state of flux in the space surrounding SCP-306's walls. The applied field continually suppresses all anti-gravitational forces, making it impossible for humans to jump upward or downward from the area. Movement within SCP-306 is possible, but only up and down.</p><p>Although no one has stepped outside of SCP-306 since its anomalous effect began, the effects of this presence have not yet been determined.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-306 was discovered in ██████ ███████, England when a Foundation operative uncovered the abandoned house after █████████'s death. The site had been abandoned for approximately 50 years. The door to the house had been removed at some point during its abandonment; this door is now kept in a containment locker in Site 36.</p><p>SCP-306 was initially contained through the use of a strong electromagnetic field and an airtight, soundproof room. This procedure has proven ineffective against SCP-306. The current containment procedures have been developed specifically for this test.</p><p><strong>Incident Report 306-A:</strong> On 11/03/2000, an anomaly occurred during an attempt to modify the containment procedures used for SCP-306. As part of these modifications, the floor of SCP-306 had been removed and replaced with an airtight layer of lead. The lead was removed again on 12/05/2000, after which all instances of SCP-306-1 ceased manifesting in the containment area.</p><p>As of 10/18/2003, all instances of SCP-306-1 have ceased manifesting in the containment area. The anomalous properties of SCP-306 are no longer in effect."]</p>
