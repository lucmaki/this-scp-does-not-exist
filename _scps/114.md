<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-114</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-114 is to be stored in a 6 x 8  m (20' x 24') storage locker at Secure Containment Area-██. The nearest exit to this area is to be barred at all times. The only people allowed outside are Level 2 scientists, research staff and security personnel.</p><p>Each of the four seasons is to be kept in a separate, airtight room with vents set at intervals along the length of the room. Temperature is to be controlled by an Automated Weather Station and fluctuate between 37°C (98°F) and 23°C (73°F). Room lighting is to be controlled manually. All information gained from testing SCP-114 is to be recorded on site clerks, who are permitted to view the results but not their original data.</p><p>SCP-114 is considered extremely hazardous; exposure severe enough to cause lethal injury or death is believed likely. Drains for spills of several liters must be installed in each room. At no time should any liquid exposure occur except under approved conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-114 is a clear sphere roughly 2 cm (0.8") across. When exposed to air, however, it immediately begins to dematerialize and solidify. When tested in the presence of any water, its surface will become perfectly smooth and glass-like, while the interior becomes habitable. A single occupant may be found riding within SCP-114 at all times when it is this way; appearing to be an exact copy of said occupant, with minor variations such as facial hair growth or weight gain/losing depending on factors such as diet and activity.</p><p>Although several observers have described the occupant as amorphous or formless, there is never any sign of solid matter within SCP-114; only a glassy sphere occupying its entire volume. The occupant is apparently unaware of its environment, but shows signs of distress if removed from it. All attempts to speak with the occupant have been unsuccessful; even eyewitnesses who can see the interior interior report seeing only "void".</p><p>Under certain circumstances, SCP-114 may spontaneously enter one of four randomly selected modes:</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, Dr. ████ was subjected to an accelerated version of SCP-114 testing, in which the occupant was not allowed to consciously control its actions. After approximately 6 hours, the interior was discovered to be completely empty. The occupants of all four modes were found to have shown signs of severe distress and had been ejected from their respective chambers.']</p>
