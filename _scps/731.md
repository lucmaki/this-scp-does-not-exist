<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-731</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-731 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. Locker chambers should be constructed of concrete and lined with steel to prevent corrosion.</p><p>The entrance to the locker chamber for SCP-731 must be equipped with an electronic lock and key or combination. The only personnel who are allowed access to the locker chamber for SCP-731 are Level 2/731 researchers, Site Director Hartwig and Dr. Clark. These persons must agree on entrance points and instructed that SCP-731 is not to be moved from therein.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-731 is a sconce, acquired by the Foundation. SCP-731 appears to be stylized as a mortar bomb, but only has six parts (a handle, body and three heads). SCP-731 is made of brass and red enamel with a red enameled band wrapped around it. The head of SCP-731 depicts the Greek expression "θείσις ἀνήρ" ("the Divine Wisdom") in green enamel.</p><p>When a person holds SCP-731 in their hands, they will feel greatly comforted, especially from the head depiction on SCP-731. This effect usually lasts for about 90 minutes, although it can be prolonged or shortened at the whim of the individual subject holding SCP-731. After this time period has passed, individuals holding SCP-731 will develop a hatred for all things holy or religious in nature. This effect will last for between one and two weeks depending on the willpower of the subject holding SCP-731.</p><p>After use, SCP-731 will act considerably different than an ordinary sconce. It is unknown if this is due to paranormal influence or if it is due to anomalous properties of SCP-731 itself. After disappearance of all other matter in the room corresponding to the mood depicted in SCP-731's head, any object that is holy in nature will disappear completely from view entirely (including other magical objects such as urns, spell components or relics). This effect only works within 6 meters of SCP-731 and no object can be affected more than once per hour.</p><p>SCP-731 was purchased by an unidentified minor con artist from an underground shop in ████████ when he was 17 years old (see Document 731A) The man who sold the object described himself as being affiliated with a religious group known as "The Church of Knowledge".</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>On █/██/████, SCP-731 was in the possession of a young man named ██████ █████████. For the next three weeks, Dr. Clark explained to young █████████ that SCP-731 was "a sconce that represented the divine wisdom". The effect of this was not immediate as it took a few days for the subject to notice that SCP-731 had a religious effect. In a conversation with Dr. Clark, ██████ █████████ began to throw holy items (mostly crosses and statues) into SCP-731\'s head, which was shown as a peace sign. This action caused SCP-731 to exhibit what is known as "anomalous propagation". SCP-731 began to grow each time an item was thrown into its head and eventually, SCP-731 was able to fill a small closet and move from there. During this process, SCP-731 was able to pass through walls, though it could not pass through solid objects.</p><p>After several weeks of use, Dr. Clark discovered that SCP-731 had been moved into a room containing several religious artifacts owned by the Foundation. The Foundation confiscated SCP-731 and kept SCP-731 in a standard containment locker until discovery (see Document 731B). After initial containment, SCP-731 has been shown to have an anomalous effect on people in the room when exposed to a religious artifact or object.</p><p>During testing, it has been discovered that holding SCP-731 will cause an individual to develop an extreme hatred for all things holy or religious in nature. After 90 minutes of exposure, said individual will become hostile towards all other religious individuals and display extreme prejudice against them. This effect will last for between one and two weeks before ending and does not carry over if another individual is introduced to the room before the effect wears off.']</p>
