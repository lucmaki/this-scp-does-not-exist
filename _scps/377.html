<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-377</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-377's activity is to be monitored 24/7 in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Foundation agents are to monitor SCP-377's body and mind for any changes, and inform of the results as soon as possible to prevent any unknown alteration from occuring. The body of SCP-377 is currently stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-77.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-377 is a male human, approximately 35 years of age. SCP-377's physical appearance is significantly altered from its natural form, being 19 cm taller and possessing a large build that is disproportionate to its young age.</p><p>SCP-377 can be referred to as a 'machinist' or 'mechanic' by external parties due to the artifacts and machines constantly located in its possession. These machines are mostly found in various stages of disassembly and repair, and are generally under-maintained; SCP-377 has been observed repairing these objects without difficulty. SCP-377 also carries around many tools stemming from the early 1900s, including a winch and saw.</p><p>When SCP-377 is active, several portable buildings, towers, and other structures are formed out of scrap or newly found items such as wood and metal. This occurs with great speed and precision, and it is currently unknown how long it takes for SCP-377 to construct these structures.</p><p>SCP-377 constructs most of these structures at random locations, but will seldom return home before each construction is completed. When returned home, SCP-377 usually claims that the construction was completed with no specific instructions other than "Build this". The reason for this is currently unknown.</p><p>When not in use or otherwise occupied with other work, SCP- 377 shows no other interest in mechanical devices or construction than the daily maintenance required for them. It relies on the care of others more than anything else when directly interacting with their design or maintenance, showing a high level of selflessness and humility when doing so.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong></p><p>Interview 376-1</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> February 8, 20██</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Irwin</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Dr. Irwin enters SCP-377's containment chamber and greets it with a smile. SCP-377 shows no reaction to his presence.</p><p><strong>Dr. Irwin:</strong> Hey there, little buddy. How are you today?</p><p>SCP-377 looks up from its work and gives a nod of acknowledgement. Dr. Irwin smiles.</p><p>Dr. Irwin takes a seat on the bench across from SCP-377. He proceeds to remove his glasses, then places them on the bench next to him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Irwin:</strong> You know, I always wondered what it would be like to work with you guys. I mean, I've been in the Foundation for over a decade now and I'm still not sure how you function day in and day out. You guys are always so busy working, but you never seem to mind us poking around in your machinery… or your home.</p><p>SCP-377 looks up at Dr. Irwin and nods its head once again. Dr. Irwin smiles once again, this time taking out a paperback book from his bag and placing it on the bench next to him. SCP-377 looks down at the book for a few seconds before looking back up at Dr. Irwin, nodding its head once more.</p><p><strong>Dr. Irwin:</strong> Oh hey, I thought I'd bring you something to read today. I know you mentioned reading when we first met, and I figured… well, maybe it'd be nice for us to have some time together away from all this machinery stuff you do so much of… I don't know, just something different I guess…</p><p>SCP-377 looks up at Dr. Irwin and nods once again, then begins working on its current project as if nothing was said. Dr. Irwin sighs in disappointment, but decides to remain silent as he turns his attention back to the book he brought along with him.</p><p>[END LOG]"]</p>
