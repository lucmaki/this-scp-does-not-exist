<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-631</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The object is to be kept in a specially constructed containment room, approximately 10 meters behind the south end of the ████████████ building. The room is to be monitored by closed-circuit television and motion detectors, with the alarm being triggered if the object moves more than 5 meters from its original position.</p><p>Site-24 personnel are to be given one key for access to SCP-631's containment area. As of Incident 631-3, all personnel are forbidden from entering SCP-631's containment area without permission from at least two Level 3 staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-631 appears to be a standard elevator of the ████████████ brand, but it has been discovered in several locations around the world. The exact source of SCP-631 is unknown, though it is theorized that it was constructed at some point during the 19th century.</p><p>SCP-631's anomalous properties manifest when an individual presses its "down" button. If the person finishes pressing the button before the elevator doors open, SCP-631 will move to a location approximately 10 meters away from its original position. It is unknown how SCP-631 does this, and it has so far only been observed to do so once per day, between the hours of noon and 1pm local time.</p><p>The effects of SCP-631's movements were first noticed on ██/██/19██, when a Foundation researcher was called to investigate an anomaly in his apartment building. When he pressed the button on his floor, SCP-631 moved to the first floor, then back down again. Since then, SCP-631 has been documented performing this action at least twice daily.</p><p>Since Incident 631-1 and Incident 631-2, all staff working with SCP-631 have become increasingly concerned that it may be attempting to escape its current containment area. Given that there are no known ways to stop SCP-631 from moving, any attempts to restrain it would most likely lead to its destruction.</p>
