<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-757</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A security perimeter is to be maintained around the site of SCP-757. No civilians are permitted beyond this perimeter. A detailed study of SCP-757 has been undertaken, but it is currently deemed too expensive to be conducted again.</p><p>Civilians are permitted to approach SCP-757 at their own risk; attempts to board or disrupt the site by any means other than the ones listed below will be met with lethal force.</p><p>Because of the secrecy of the site and its nature as a "good trading company", there are currently no plans for further research into the site, or acquisition of SCP-757.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-757 is a trading post located in the Himalayas, near the border between India and Nepal. The building is constructed of basic wood, with some sort of plaster or stone covering its roof. There are no windows visible on this side of the building. The wooden structure has two entrances: one directly at ground level, and another through the roof.</p><p>In addition to SCP-757 itself, several items are present inside of it. The first of these is a large quantity of salt, which is found to contain a total of nineteen different types of salt crystals. Each type appears to be used for a different purpose, with some being used as currency or items (such as salt shakers or oars), and others used for food (such as bread). Many sacks are also filled with animal bones that appear to have been highly salted and then dried. A small wooden sign hangs on the wall above the entrance; written in a crude hand are the words "Good Trading Company".</p><p>When anyone other than civilians approaches SCP-757, a strong odor emanates from the building. This smell is described as being similar to potpourri mixed with ammonia. Individuals affected by this smell report feeling extremely hungry and thirsty, despite having consumed one meal and three litres of water before entering SCP-757. If not fed or watered soon after entering the building, they die within two days.</p><p>The second object present at SCP-756 is an upper portion of a wooden ladder, consisting of multiple rungs approximately five centimeters apart. The rungs appear corroded internally, but otherwise usable; the top section has been sawed off at the anchor point that would've connected to it if it had been intact. However, there is no sign of any other work having been performed on the building in years prior to capture; no tools are present except for very basic ones such as axes or shovels (which were likely stolen long ago) found around SCP-757's perimeter; and there were no signposts at all inside SCP-756 that could have indicated where it was located.</p><p>The third object present at SCP-756 consists of several small bags filled with small stones. These stones are themselves not anomalous in any way — they simply do not seem to interact with anything but each other when cracked open. A fourth item may be recovered from outside the building if an empty sack filled with salt is provided to SCP-757 (see Incident Report 757-A).</p><p>If an individual attempts to exit SCP-757 and bring back more than a pound of salt (under normal temperature conditions), and if that individual does not return within two days (even if they attempted to break open their bag of stones while still within SCP-757), then that person will become separated from normal reality, becoming trapped inside SCP-757 and unable again to escape until they starve or suffocate due to exposure. This effect only lasts until four pounds of salt have been brought out or until eight hours have passed since departure from inside SCP-757; anything beyond that weight cannot be recovered until after thirty minutes pass following departure.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
