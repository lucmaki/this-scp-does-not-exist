<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-501</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-501 is to be held in a standard containment locker, located in Site-19. It is to be provided with a variety of materials and toys, but no items are to be brought into the testing chamber or placed on the pedestal. The cost of one month's worth of food rations will be deducted from its current value at the end of each month.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-501 is a stackable Magic: The Gathering card game deck, and is currently comprised of 52 black-bordered cards divided among five different types:</p><p>SCP-501 was purchased in 1987 for $12.95 at a "Uncle's Games" store, located in [REDACTED], Washington, USA. SCP-501 does not bear any distinguishing marks or labels on the outside of the packaging. SCP-501 exhibits no anomalous properties when examined under non-anomalous magnification, and will draw no attention to itself when viewed by an average human under normal conditions; however, if SCP-501 is viewed while its pedestal is covered with any sort of cloth (such as a handkerchief), photocopied cards, or other materials, it will activate and become animate. In this state, SCP-501 will attempt to steal any item placed upon its pedestal; these items range from pens to papers to clothes to playing cards to a small stone carving of a dragon. If the pedestal remains undisturbed for more than 30 minutes, SCP-501 will return to its inactive state. However, if moved with sufficient force or reoriented, it will remain animated indefinitely</p><p>When SCP-501 is animated, it will attempt to find another instance of SCP-501 made from paper or fabric based off of the same set of rules. This process begins anew every time SCP-501 is animated. Comparison shows that the number of possible combinations available are far greater than the number of possible decks; however, as each instance of SCP-501 has been created through different methods (card shuffling vs. actual play) and by different people, little information has been gathered about how this process occurs.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-501 was brought to Foundation attention on May 13, 1989, when the owner of a local magic shop reported having sold an unopened pack of SCP-501 to a teenager on March 29, 1989. The teenager had been living in [REDACTED], Washington, USA, for the prior three weeks, and had taken up residence at the store shortly after it opened. The owner was contacted by the police department and asked to identify the teen in question. The owner reviewed his surveillance footage and identified a young man named ████████ █████. When interviewed, ████████ █████ claimed to have purchased SCP-501 from a secondhand store in [REDACTED], Washington, USA where "Uncle\'s Games" had previously operated.</p><p>When questioned about any other purchases or activity during the three weeks he had been there, ████████ █████ claimed that he did not purchase anything while there, stating that he did not know where to go or what to do if he did not have SCP-501 with him. He also claimed that he had no interest in purchasing any new equipment or cards, believing that he would just be wasting money. When questioned about how he was able to afford to live in [REDACTED], Washington, USA for three weeks without making any purchases, the teen admitted that he had been paid 200 "bits" per week by someone before departing. The owner of the store was unable to verify the origin of this payment; however, he did report that the source of the payment was [REDACTED] and had previously lived there for approximately two years before moving to [REDACTED].</p><p><strong>Interview Log 014-A-01:</strong></p><p>Interviewed: ████████ █████</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ████████</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Thank you for agreeing to speak with us today. I apologize for taking up your time; however, we must conduct this interview under standard procedure regarding information regarding SCP objects. Please tell me everything you remember about SCP-501.</p><p>SCP-501\'s pedestal has been cleared and is currently empty; however, it will animate if any items are placed upon it.</p><p>SCP-501 begins levitating several inches above its pedestal as Dr. ████████ begins speaking.</p><p><strong>SCP-501:</strong> I \'eard ya wanted ta know abou\' my chesta piece.
