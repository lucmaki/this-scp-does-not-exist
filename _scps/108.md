<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-108</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-108 are to be monitored through surveillance cameras (stationary and mobile), tracking devices, and remote hacking. The Space Department has been called in to inspect instances of SCP-108 and make repairs as necessary, with the help of a Foundation civilian contractor.</p><p>Researchers are to be on hand for any unusual activity detected. Video footage is to be downloaded to a Foundation database for analysis.</p><p>Due to the recent discovery of several SCP-108s located outside the solar system, additional research has been assigned to SCP-112-A.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-108 designates a floating, rectangular structure in space with no detectable means of propulsion. Current theories attribute SCP-108's appearance to the gravitational force exerted on it by a passing solar system.</p><p>SCP-108 does not appear as a discrete entity, but rather as a three-dimensional projection of random geometric shapes belonging to the limited set [DATA EXPUNGED]. These shapes are predominantly squares and rectangles, although certain examples may include other polygonal figures.</p><p>The Foundation has observed that SCP-108 has no up or down orientation, but is instead completely level across all manifestations. It can be seen from any point in the solar system, regardless of its position relative to the sun. SCP-108 has not been observed to move, change shape, or disappear in any way.</p><p>It is unknown if all instances of SCP-108 are identical, but they do exhibit several similarities:</p><p>The first reported instance of SCP-108 was discovered by Foundation radar installations in 1904 in the Pleiades star cluster. At this time there were still only five known moons orbiting Jupiter. All satellites orbiting Uranus and Neptune had yet to be discovered. In addition, telescopes at this time were unable to detect objects in orbit around Earth and Venus. However, taking into account the time required for an object to leave Earth's gravity well and reach Uranus or Neptune (approximately 41 years at these speeds) and considering calculations for Jupiter's orbits (approximately 25 years at these speeds), it can be concluded that this first report did not indicate the existence of an anomalous object until after 1915.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Further study has determined that in fact, at this time there were no known objects in orbit around the singularity of the Pleiades cluster.</p><p>The first instance of SCP-108 observed to move was discovered on 10/21/1905 in the Uranian system. It was initially believed to be an asteroid, but further investigation determined it to be a hollowed-out Earth-like planetoid. Examination of the interior revealed no signs of habitation, and tests on the outer shell showed that it was composed of [DATA EXPUNGED] metal.</p><p>This led to speculation that SCP-108 was "hollow space", and that it contained an infinitely long corridor. The Foundation attempted to probe the interior of SCP-108 and identify its end, but after two months a hull breach occurred, causing the object to accelerate rapidly and launch itself into interplanetary space.</p><p>The next reported instance of SCP-108 was discovered on [DATA EXPUNGED] by astronomers stationed at ████████ Observatory. Even though they had previously detected several non-anomalous asteroids, they failed to recognize this particular one because it was moving slowly enough for them to see and track for several days. The object\'s speed increased abruptly, and it left the solar system within hours.']</p>
