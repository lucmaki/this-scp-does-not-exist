<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-446</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-446 is to be contained in a specially constructed, soundproofed room with all windows and doors blocked off. The room's temperature must be kept at a consistent level of 20 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-446 is a wooden podium 2 meters high containing an electronic device made up of a pair of speakers connected to an oscilloscope. The device is capable of emitting sounds of different frequencies, which are said to be extremely damaging to human hearing. SCP-446 was recovered from the █████ █████ College in ██████████, ██████, in 1997. SCP-446 was found on the stage during an opening ceremony for the college's drama department. It was labeled "Announcing the New Age of Science".</p><p>When activated, SCP-446 will emit noises resembling speech patterns used by humans, but with components that will cause physical harm to any listener. Human listeners will experience acute damage in their ear canals due to various conditions such as bleeding, swelling and/or disorientation. The only known way to prevent this is by removing the affected ears or otherwise shielding them from external stimuli.</p><p>The physical effects generated by SCP-446 were first recorded audio logs collected by Dr. ███████ in 1997. These were followed by experiments conducted with D-Class personnel in order to determine the exact structure and properties of the effect. The following is a list of information gathered from the audio logs and experiments:</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/1999, Dr. ███████ recorded an audio log containing a series of noises that were not present in any of the other logs, and was thus designated SCP-446-1. This document contains the following content:</p><p><strong>(NOTE:</strong> Dr. ███████\'s experimental log has been edited to remove personal information.)</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> I have a theory. Could SCP-446-1 be a message in itself?</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> I need to run a few more tests, but I\'m almost positive.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> Listen to this.</p><p>[15 seconds of silence]</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> What is this? It\'s… it\'s too familiar for me to be able to place it. But it\'s definitely there.</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> I can\'t believe this. I\'ve heard it before…</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> It was in my head! The voice spoke to me! It told me about the device!</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> He said that he had made a mistake on his design, that he had thought that the device would just cause pain but it would actually be destroying the human ear!</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> And then I heard a name… he said that the device was compatible with all humans and he called himself "G". He was happy to announce that the New Age of Science was coming, and that all scientists would now have access to new tools and techniques, and they would be able to make a lot of money!</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> I heard him say something else, but it was very hard to understand him through my screaming…</p><p><strong>Dr. ███████:</strong> He repeated the word "Equality." That\'s all I could hear before it cut off for good.']</p>
