<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-693</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-693 is to be contained in a secure concrete containment cell, located in Site 17. A single window has been placed at the front of the object; SCP-693 is not to be removed from this area. The monitoring station is to remain staffed 24/7 with two guards. Any personnel entering the chamber are to report any deviations in its condition immediately, and are not to remove SCP-693 from the viewing area without permission.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-693 is a standard photographic printing press, albeit an exceptionally large one. It appears to be in near-perfect working order, and was assembled by the same manufacturer as another press of its size and model. The object's printing plate area is covered in a layer of plaster, varying in thickness from 0.5 mm to 3 cm. It also includes a blank sheet of paper.</p><p>SCP-693 displays anomalous properties when removed from its cell, or when it is filled with printing ink or other chemicals capable of interacting with light. When these conditions are met, it will begin to produce a variety of images and text. These do not follow any recognizable design scheme, and are produced in a random manner. Although these images will sometimes include visible people or animals, most resemble abstractions of various shapes and colors.</p><p>If an image is printed onto paper using SCP-693 with ink, it will not produce any further anomalous effects until the paper is processed into paper pulp or some other material that can be used for reproduction. Ink printed on parchment or papyrus will have the same anomalous effect, but will behave differently when they are processed into paper products that do not require ink to be created again. Images on cloth cannot be reproduced normally even if they are printed directly onto the material instead of being placed on paper — those recovered so far have been produced only after being sewn onto garments designed for this specific purpose.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Recovery</p><p>SCP-693 was discovered in the walls of a ████████, Michigan home. The residents of the house were killed in a fire shortly after the object was discovered, and the house was abandoned shortly thereafter. It is believed that they were killed by SCP-693 while they slept. The only items recovered from the house were several books, including an encyclopedia and several volumes of ████████ ████████ █████. The books were written in a variety of languages, including Ancient Greek, Latin, Old English, Old French, Old Germanic and Old Russian. These books make mention of SCP-693; the authors state that it was constructed for them by their patron ███████ ████████. The books also state that ███████ ████████ "is a man of great power", which is said to be why he aided them in creating SCP-693.']</p>
