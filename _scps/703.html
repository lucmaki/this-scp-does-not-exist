<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-703</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid-V</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The foundation has started a campaign to exterminate SCP-703 via social media. All instances of SCP-702 are to be monitored for hypodermic injection and have their syringes removed. The Foundation has also taken the initiative to purge SCP-703's memetic properties in the memeosphere, which has become a significant challenge due to SCP-703's wide availability and social media reach.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-703 is a memetic phenomenon affecting individuals with ████,███,███ as a first name. The SCP targets individuals who are, or are likely to be members of an organized club, social group or student association. Individuals affected by SCP-703 may become drawn to the club's interests and “feelings”. Once the subject is drawn in, they become convinced that they are part of the club from which they were originally removed. Subsequently, most instances of SCP-703 will display behavioral alterations consistent with their solidified beliefs about the club.</p><p>In addition to these alterations, subject's personality changes will occur; generally becoming more friendly and social towards other club members with whom they associate. However, changes to the individual's persona are not limited to those associated with the SCP. It is notable that these personality changes are absent when the subject is not in the presence of another member of similar demographics.</p><p>SCP-703 was discovered in 1971 after a case study noted several instances of SCP-703 among elderly women who had been attending sewing clubs since the late 19th Century. Foundation surveillance was able to identify all but three of the subjects as members of a local chapter of Sisters Clubs International (SCI), an international organization dedicated to making “sisterhood attainable for every woman”. Furthermore, many attendants exhibit altered behaviors during sewing club meetings and take repeated injections of [REDACTED].</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, a member of the Sisters Clubs International was detained after attempting to perform an injection on herself. After searching her belongings, the Foundation discovered a number of SCP-703 related items near her residence.</p><p>Foundation agents were able to retrieve the following items from the subject's residence:</p><p>These items were recovered and taken into Foundation custody.</p>
