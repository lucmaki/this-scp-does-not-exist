<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-756</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-756 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-17's Department of Biological Safety and Containment. SCP-756 is to be fed twice daily by security personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-756 is a male Caucasian pig, weighing 170 kg. The pig has a number of wounds on its body that, upon close inspection, reveal to be the absence of organs and tissue. The pig is currently in a fairly contracted state; as a result, it is incapable of [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>The pig's "mouth" is lined with a type of mucous membrane (believed to be made up mainly of cartilage) that allows it to speak. SCP-756 primarily communicates through grunts and squeals.</p><p>SCP-756 was recovered from ████, Missouri in ████ after reports surfaced that several wild pigs in the area were speaking human languages without any apparent behavioral changes. After a Foundation agent was sent to infiltrate the town, it was discovered that an individual named ██████ ██████████, who had recently lost their job due to local authorities regarding his anomalous religious practices, had been keeping the "princes" as pets. When interviewed, SCP-756 claimed to be the King of the ██████████ Kingdom and proceeded to list several laws he believed should be instituted in his kingdom.</p><p>A team was sent to investigate SCP-756's claims. Upon arriving at the residence of Mr. ██████████, SCP-556 approached them and proceeded to address them as "king". This led to the discovery of SCP-556 and SCP-756 being related; several days later they were found sleeping together in the same bed. Despite attempts by Agents Graves and Jacobs to separate them, SCP-556 continued to refer to itself as "Queen Bossonitis". Their relationship appears to have remained purely sexual as no other signs of affection have been observed between them.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-756 was initially kept in a standard containment locker, but the following incident led to it being moved to a specially designed containment tank.</p><p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-756 was observed to have an erection of several inches. The pig\'s penis was withdrawn from its "mouth" and placed into a special device. After several hours of this procedure, SCP-756 regained its consciousness and began screaming in pain and uttering a large quantity of profanities. After exiting its tank, SCP-756 proceeded to drag itself over to where its penis had been removed and attempted to reinsert it into its mouth. When it found that it could not do so, SCP-756 attempted to chew on it. This activity was observed by Dr. Graves and Agent Jacobs, who attempted to separate the two creatures.</p><p>After the removal of SCP-756\'s penis, SCP-556 began screaming at SCP-756 in a similar manner as before. SCP-756 began furiously flailing its hooves at the other creature and attempted to kick it repeatedly. It then proceeded to drag itself back into its tank, where it has remained since then.']</p>
