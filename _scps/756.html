<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-756</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-756 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-17's Department of Biological Safety and Containment. SCP-756 is to be fed twice daily by security personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-756 is a male Caucasian pig, weighing 170 kg. The pig has a number of wounds on its body that, upon close inspection, reveal to be the absence of organs and tissue. The pig is currently in a fairly contracted state; as a result, it is incapable of [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>The pig's "mouth" is lined with a type of mucous membrane (believed to be made up mainly of cartilage) that allows it to speak. SCP-756 primarily communicates through grunts and squeals.</p><p>SCP-756 was recovered from ████, Missouri in ████ after reports surfaced that several wild pigs in the area were speaking human languages without any apparent behavioral changes. After a Foundation agent was sent to infiltrate the town, it was discovered that an individual named ██████ ██████████, who had recently lost their job due to local authorities regarding his anomalous religious practices, had been keeping the "princes" as pets. When interviewed, SCP-756 claimed to be the King of the ██████████ Kingdom and proceeded to list several laws he believed should be instituted in his kingdom.</p><p>A team was sent to investigate SCP-756's claims. Upon arriving at the residence of Mr. ██████████, SCP-556 approached them and proceeded to address them as "king". This led to the discovery of SCP-556 and SCP-756 being related; several days later they were found sleeping together in the same bed. Despite attempts by Agents Graves and Jacobs to separate them, SCP-556 continued to refer to itself as "Queen Bossonitis". Their relationship appears to have remained purely sexual as no other signs of affection have been observed between them.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
