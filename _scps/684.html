<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-684</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-684 is not to be entered without prior authorization. No personnel may enter SCP-684 more than twice per month unless for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-684 is a colony of translucent, gelatinous organisms resembling microbes. SCP-684 has a large number of protrusions all over its body, similar to a fungal mycelial structure. SCP-684 appears to be able to change the appearance of these protrusions at will by retracting them into its body and then extruding new ones. SCP-684 uses the new protrusions for either locomotion or sensorium, and does not appear to require energy for this ability.</p><p>SCP-684's main body appears to be about 8 meters in length, and consists of several subunits connected by tubes. The individual subunits resemble fungi, with long stringy appendages protruding from their heads as tendrils, and multiple gills along the dorsal side. Due to its lack of soft tissue, and the lack of eyes or visible organs on the surface, it is impossible to determine the internal structure of SCP-684.</p><p>SCP-684 lacks any known method of locomotion other than through these tendrils. However, by extending itself with these tendrils and stretching its body outwards in all directions while simultaneously contracting its central mass, SCP-684 is able to "walk", albeit very slowly.</p><p>The environment surrounding SCP-684 remains uninhabitable to humans until at least one month after next sighting of SCP-684. Upon entering in contact with SCP-684, subjects find themselves within a white space which can only be described as an upper atmosphere that was previously incapable of supporting life due to an intense radioactivity. This radiation is not harmful unless ingested via inhalation, at which point it becomes fatal without treatment within a few hours. Radiation from this source suggests that any stars previously existing in this part of space were destroyed millions or even billions of years ago due to an unknown event - possibly from an impact event from another star or another form of stellar phenomena such as supernova explosions or gamma ray bursts - that radiated the area so severely it became completely uninhabitable for biology except for SCP-684. The ongoing sleep cycle observed by those subject to entry into SCP-684 is apparently caused by accumulated radiation infiltrating the body through skin and living tissues on a biological basis after prolonged exposure time. It is too early at present to determine if this phenomenon occurs in other parts of space or if it is unique both to this location and those creatures who inhabit it.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> As of 24/10/████, the frequency of SCP-684's activity has increased to once every two months. The projected speed of this increase is unknown at present, but it is expected to continue indefinitely, as predicted by the data collected during previous containment breaches."]</p>
