<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-478</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-478 is to be kept in a guarded vault at Site-77. Security is to be maintained by the presence of two armed guards. Any civilian who exceeds the maximum distance of 50 m away from SCP-478 (Note: Approximately 10 meters) is to be detained, cataloged and examined for any anomalous properties. SCP-478 is not to be studied without authorization from at least one Level 4 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-478 is a bowling ball of painted wood, stained with what SCP-478-1 identifies as "topaz resin" from the interior of SCP-478. SCP-478 resembles a standard piece of equipment in almost every way and exhibits no unusual features aside from its anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-478 does not produce any sound when rolled upon a surface. When rolled, it produces an identical sound to that produced by a ball rolling on the surface of a ball field. Further testing with subject D-478 have shown that if the balls do not roll directly onto the surface, they will move through it and disappear. The exact manner in which this happens is unknown at the moment; the effect seems to somehow interact with the presence of the subject or subjects involved and has been observed to occur regardless of distance or motion of the subject under test. All attempts at pinning down the nature of this interaction have failed and thus far all methods used have been non-invasive.</p><p>When rolled, any body parts that make contact with SCP-478 will be involuntarily drawn towards it, even through concrete walls or metal objects. Subjects affected by this phenomenon will feel themselves being pulled towards SCP-478 until they become unconscious after which their bodies will vanish from their original positions. If a subject incapacitated by SCP-478's effect is transported behind an object (e.g. concrete wall) in a vehicle driven by another person affected by SCP-478, the vehicle will still appear on a monitor within fifteen seconds of being transported but it will be empty and note that there is mass present on the driver seat, but not in front of them.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum-478-1:</strong> On 19/04/2003, the Foundation uncovered a conspiracy involving high ranking members of the ████████ Council, the Mayor of ████████ and several other civilian and Foundation personnel. The plot involved the "abduction" of SCP-478 by means of a large crane to be used in an unknown experiment. The investigation was lead by D-478 and resulted in the capture of several persons involved in the plot, as well as a full confession from Mayor ██████.</p><p><strong>Autopsy Report:</strong> As per the instructions of the Foundation, D-478 was brought to a local hospital for examination. Upon arrival, D-478 began to undergo an unusual phenomenon; their body underwent drastic changes, their skin became pale and virtually all hair on their body vanished, the arms and legs were significantly elongated and the jaw protruded prominently. D-478 then proceeded to tear their vocal chords out before slitting their throat with a sharp object. After this, D-478 vanished.']</p>
