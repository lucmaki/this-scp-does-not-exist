<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-162</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-162 is kept in a standard Secure Containment Locker at Site-15. Due to the small size of SCP-162, it requires little energy for its containment. It is capable of being triggered by electromagnetic activity (such as an EMP), and its anomalous effects may be suppressed with appropriate shielding.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-162 is a circular ring, 4.5 cm in diameter and 3 cm thick. This containment locker is fitted with a standard electronic keypad and has two small compartments for permanent storage of materials (see testing log below). The exterior surface of SCP-162 does not appear to be of any sort of metal composite, though it does appear to be slightly reflective. It appears to be able to remove its anomalous properties through exposure to electromagnetic radiation.</p><p>When exposed to an open circuit or vacuum, SCP-162 will respond by deforming its surface into the shape of an object that resembles a chainring for a size 27 or 28 chain. In this form, the surface will slowly replace the existing material over it until it forms a full chainring. The new alloy formed will carry the properties of steel, titanium and other common alloys found in commercial bicycle chains. The presence of titanium will reduce the weight of the new alloy by approximately 20%, while the presence of cobalt reduces the effective weight by approximately 50%. After 18 hours when not exposed to any outside energy source, the newly minted chainring will dissolve back into its original material.</p><p>This effect can also be applied to other objects (e.g., bicycle wheels), but results are less predictable and more difficult to control and monitor. Due to the scientific nature of SCP-162’s effects, no testing involving human subjects is currently authorized. Testing Log:</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 162-1:</strong> As of ██/██/████, SCP-162 is no longer capable of exhibiting its anomalous properties. The cause of this event has not been established and further testing is to be suspended indefinitely.']</p>
