<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-213</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Red-Object-</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-213 is contained in a spare containment locker at Site-77. Due to its anomalous properties, SCP-213 requires no outside power or heat sources, and has been successfully maintained over the course of its containment with only minimal maintenance.</p><p>Due to the nature of its anomalous properties, SCP-213 is only ever to be worn by personnel directly involved with testing. Any other personnel approaching SCP-213 must immediately leave the vicinity or suffer acute mental trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-213 is a pink cotton t-shirt, with white ink printed across the front of it. The letters "HNK" are printed on the front in black.</p><p>When worn by a human subject, SCP-213 will cause the subject to begin to hallucinate the appearance of a humanoid or lower lifeform, labeled as SCP-213-1 under the proper conditions.</p><p>SCP-213's anomalous properties put forth that testing is best conducted in close proximity to an actual D-Class personnel. When used for isolation testing, SCP-213 must be worn in conjunction with at least ██ (███) other D-Class personnel. No more than 3 additional D-Class personnel are acceptable for an experiment involving SCP-213.</p><p>The following conditions must be met in order for SCP-213 to function:</p><p>At this time, no one has successfully identified what the anomaly exactly is which causes SCP-213 to react this way. Given its anomalous properties, the Foundation has classified SCP-213 as a red object.</p><p>Red objects cannot be contained without extreme danger and failure to contain them can lead to catastrophic damage to Foundation property and personnel alike.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 213-1:</strong> Incident 214-01:</p><p>On ██/██/██, a D-Class personnel wearing SCP-213 was placed in a locker at Site-77. The D-class personnel was then moved to a storage closet. The following is a log of events and interviews with those affected by the incident.</p><p><strong>19:02:</strong> The D-Class personnel was instructed to put on the shirt. The following is their account of the event.</p><p><strong>19:04:</strong> The shirt was removed. The following is their account of the event.</p><p><strong>23:30:</strong> An interview with the personnel revealed that they were experiencing hallucinations of SCP-213-1 as they had been instructed to do so. However, they did not state that these hallucinations were particularly pleasant or vivid.</p><p><strong>03:00:</strong> The D-Class personnel began to experience further hallucinations after being told to remove the shirt again.</p><p><strong>06:05:</strong> Shortly after being told to remove the shirt for the third time, D-2162 began to scream loudly and repeatedly run into various items in the area, including other people and objects in containment cells, as well as parts of the nearby walls and floors.</p><p><strong>06:08:</strong> D-2162 began attempting to eat her own finger, yelling "How about some extra crispy chicken tonight?", referencing SCP-173. It should be noted that D-2162 had little to no knowledge of SCP-173 prior to this incident, and had only seen it on television as a child.</p><p><strong>06:12:</strong> D-2162 began to howl at the ceiling, resulting in her head colliding with it multiple times. After knocking herself unconscious while falling off of a chair and onto the floor, she was rushed back to her cell, where she was sedated and taken to medical attention soon after.</p><p><strong>06:15:</strong> The following interview took place between Dr. Faraday and D-2162 once she had recovered from her injuries and sedation.</p>
