<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-366</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area of the bridge over the Tagus River in the city of Lisbon, Portugal is to be monitored via closed circuit television. Apart from these restrictions, SCP-366 itself is to be kept in a secure storage facility in an abandoned office building in Lisbon.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-366 is a public square in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The area of SCP-366 measures 21 sqm and is the property of the City Council. SCP-366 has no anomalous properties other than its effect on human psychology and behavior at all times, even when no individual is within it.</p><p>SCP-366's effect is manifested as an extremely peaceful atmosphere in the immediate area, with an unusually high level of security and safety precautions taken against criminal activity. The affected area also manifests a highly effective, centrally-organized police force consisting of uniformly well-dressed officers who are invariably polite and always willing to help an individual in need, such as moving someone away from a fight or danger, or escorting individuals to their destination.</p><p>A further notable effect is that the entire police force will become passive upon exiting the area, including removing their badges and showing them to civilians who are not under investigation in any way. Should anyone be searched by police officers inside SCP-366 they may be found to contain various items in their pockets, such as cash or business cards.</p><p>As with most urban areas, traffic in Lisbon between 08:00 and 19:00 consists mainly of cars without drivers (especially taxis) and those with drivers who idle at stops for no reason outside of rush hour traffic. These drivers tend not to cause trouble unless they are disturbed by an external event such as a fire or accident. Drivers will unknowingly give up their seats to elderly or disabled persons if asked politely.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 366.1:</strong> SCP-366 was discovered after a series of events. On 19th September, 1999, a driver from the local taxi company drove into the area despite his passengers\' pleas to stop and go elsewhere. After exiting SCP-366 (and removing his uniform) he returned to report to his dispatcher that he had been told to go somewhere else and that it was a "ghost town." When questioned he stated that he had been abruptly ordered to return by an unseen superior.</p><p>The driver was reassigned to another taxi service and his uniform was recovered by a police officer who entered the area and was instructed to stay there by police officers patrolling outside the area. The uniform was then recovered by another officer who had entered the area using a public entrance. The uniform proved to contain various items of note, such as business cards, driver licenses and photographs of individuals in plain clothes on its inside lining.</p>
