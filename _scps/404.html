<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-404</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-404 is currently contained at Site 78. Personnel wishing to enter SCP-404 must first write down all items they wish to retrieve from within the containment chamber, and submit the list to Security Officer ████. All items not listed will be removed permanently, and the test subject denied access to SCP-404 until the next monthly review session.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-404 is a small island located 332 meters from the coast of ███████, ██████. The landmass itself appears to be composed of solid granite. All trees and other foliage on SCP-404 have been sterilized, removing any possibility for flora growth.</p><p>SCP-404 was discovered following reports of spontaneous combustion in various locations around ███████. Foundation Agents were able to track down the source of these fires to a small shack at the center of SCP-404, where they found the body of Dr. ███, founder of the ██████████ ██████████ company, who had been missing for 6 months. No cause of death could be determined due to incineration, but a piece of paper with Dr. ███’s handwriting was found next to his remains. On it was written “Show Off” in capital letters.</p><p>No further information has been discovered regarding Dr. ███ or SCP-404.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum-1:</strong> Owing to the secrecy surrounding SCP-404, no further testing of the object itself is permitted.</p>
