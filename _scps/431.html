<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-431</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-431 is to be kept in a security locker at Site-19. It is to be inspected monthly by three (3) or more (4) level-2 personnel and their buffer in order to make sure that the armor is secure and not damaged, and that it remains non-magnetic. A basic entry program must be made before any item may enter the locker, which consists of a list of all personnel assigned to inspect the object. Personnel are told only to open the pocket protector if they are absolutely certain that it has been secured properly.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-431 is a small, solid steel pocket protector (a “Kleenex”) with a smooth steel surface. The edges of the pieces are tapered slightly, presumably to make them easier to use. SCP-431 weight is 27.62 grams, and the outer dimensions are 2.3 cm x 3 cm x 0.5 cm.</p><p>When subjected to electromagnetism, SCP-431 will spontaneously generate armor made of highly compacted iron (typically 6-8 layers, but can reach up to 20 in some cases), approximately 1 cm thick and 150–200 meters in length per layer. SCP-641 will also form around the subject's hands and feet, forming a solid covering when combined with SCP-431, effectively protecting them from most forms of damage otherwise lethal or incapacitating. The armor formed by SCP-641 is bulletproof and fireproof to a depth of approximately 150–185 meters, depending on the subject. The armor will manifest as quickly as 3 seconds after exposure to electromagnetic fields, and remains for at least two hours upon manifestation.</p><p>Armed personnel are not affected by this effect; however, anything other than steel does not prevent the creation of an armored shell from SCP-641 armor plates. If a non-steel object is in place of SCP-641 armor plates (such as paper), no effect will occur at all.</p><p>SCP-431 was recovered from an anomalous event that occurred on January 31st, 2006 in New York City when civil police officers were called to the scene of an armed robbery at the Empire State Building during which an assassin who had been disguised as one of the building’s maintenance workers fired several shots into a group of tourists on the observation deck below. None of the bullets struck any tourist targets; however, two bullets ricocheted off some steel girders, striking and seriously injuring Overseer ██████ while she was inspecting security cameras located on the roof. She received several broken ribs and lacerations to her head and face which required extensive medical attention; however, she did not sustain any serious brain damage or permanent neurological damage despite being struck directly in the head by one of the bullets. All bullet casings found at the scene have been found to be steel, showing that it was indeed SCP-431 that formed around Overseer ██████ after she took a direct hit from a .22 long rifle bullet.</p><p>It was later discovered that Amanda ████████ is actually Amandine "Dev" Saldana; however, her name had never appeared on any official police reports or logs despite being assigned to Site-19 for nearly two years at this point due to paperwork delays caused by her civilian status (as a student). It is believed that SCP-431 spontaneously formed around her due to her having been wearing it when she was struck by the bullets.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is a log of the events surrounding Overseer ██████’s injury and recovery.</p><p>The following entry was recovered from Overseer ██████’s journal prior to being injured.</p><p>Pandora’s Box has been opened. This may go down in history books as the first time a Foundation agent has been injured by the Foundation itself. I hope those who would see this as an unfortunate accident will understand that the precautions we take are for their own protection and well-being. We have to keep the Foundation pure, and I will do everything within my power to ensure that it remains so. - Overseer ██████</p>
