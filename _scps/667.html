<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-667</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-667 is to be kept in a Secure Locker at Site-██. SCP-667 is currently sealed with a 10 cm by 10 cm (3.9 in by 3.9 in) airlock covering; this is the only time it is to be opened. Any person wishing to access SCP-667 must have a clearance of Level 4 or higher, and must be accompanied by a security officer.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-667 is a small, silver object similar in appearance to an inkwell, with an inscription of "HELVETIA" on the bottom, and the words "CASSAIA" and "JUDICIA" on opposing sides. SCP-667 cannot be physically moved by any means other than that provided by a security officer. All attempts to remove it from its container have been unsuccessful; objects have been moved in rapid succession and then released to return to their original positions, but SCP-667 retains its movement restrictions.</p><p>While SCP-667 is contained within its container, if one of the words engraved on it (CASSAIA or JUDICIA) is spoken aloud while an individual is looking at it, they will instantly become unable to move their body in any way unless given permission by another person. If this person speaks the word(s) aloud again while looking at them, they will supernaturally cease movement and fall into a state of total paralysis. Attempts to move these subjects are futile, as they are not able to do so without being given verbal orders by someone else. Subjects remain in this state until an order is given to them verbally or physically. The subject will become stiff and immobile for several hours before regaining feeling in their limbs; no apparent short-term side effects have occurred during this time. Subjects who reach this stage but are not given permission to move again will die from asphyxiation due to the lack of breathing. Therefore, all testing involving SCP-667 must be performed in a secluded area where there are no other living creatures present.</p><p>When an individual hears either of the words CASSAIA or JUDICIA spoken aloud on SCP-667, no anomalous side effects will occur; however, one of the words spoken aloud (CASSAIA or JUDICIA) must be pronounced identically during test trials. If two different individuals pronounce the word using the correct pronunciation while looking at SCP-667 at exactly the same moment, they will instantaneously become able to move unimpeded once more (see Experiment Log #1).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 666-01:</strong></p><p>Test Result: Subject vocalized the word "CASSAIA" while looking at SCP-667. Subject immediately stopped all movement and fell into a state of total immobility. Subject was incapacitated for approximately 7 hours before being released.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> This test indicates that a subject must be able to move to be affected by SCP-667. A second test should be performed to discover how much movement is required.</p><p><strong>Test Result:</strong> Subject vocalized the word "JUDICIA" while looking at SCP-667. Subject immediately stopped all movement and fell into a state of total immobility. Subject was incapacitated for approximately 36 hours before being released.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> This test indicates that a subject must be able to move to be affected by SCP-667.
