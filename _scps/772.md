<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-772</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-772 is contained within a standard thermal radiation and soundproof cell at Site-█. Personnel entering SCP-772's containment cell are to wear ear protection and avoid direct head contact with the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-772 is a fishing pole with an attached bucket. The object was recovered from ██████ Lake in ████. The object shows no observable wear and appears to have been manufactured at the time of its recovery. A small marking on the object reads "Best Quality".</p><p>When positioned in the presence of animate objects, SCP-772 will open and reveal a small, bioluminescent organism (designated SCP-772-A) which will jump into the subject's ear canal and will display no negative effects on the subject's mind or body.</p><p>SCP-772-A will exit the subject's ear via any means available to it (typically by exiting through their nose) and remain dormant for approximately two hours before jumping out of the subject's ear canal again. It is unknown if SCP-772 itself may be affected by this process. Once removed from the subject, SCP-772-A will continue displaying behavior consistent with that of a normal Dictyostelium physiology and physiology functioning at levels 3 times that of Earth organisms.</p><p>SCP-772 was originally believed to be a hoax due to its apparent simplicity and lack of anomalous value; however, research into this hypothesis has revealed inconsistencies in the physical characteristics of SCP-772 which could only be explained by a second agent operating under cover as part of a testing procedure during its distribution. Further investigations have shown that all samples distributed prior to March 10th, 1971 fell into containment before making further anomalous contact with subjects.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-772 was first reported as being in Foundation custody on March 10th, 1971. An investigation into the source of SCP-772\'s anomalous properties revealed the existence of a second, unidentified agent operating under cover as a distributor of fishing equipment and supplies. Further investigation has shown that this agent was able to make contact with subjects of SCP-772\'s anomalous effect while they were still within the distribution chain.</p><p>Upon recovery of SCP-772, the Foundation was contacted by Agent ████████ with a request for custody. The request was denied and Agent ████████ was detained under suspicion of collaboration with SCP-772 prior to its recovery. Agent ████████\'s file is classified as "Suspicious".']</p>
