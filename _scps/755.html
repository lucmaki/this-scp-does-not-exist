<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-755</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-755 is stored in a container lined with lead plates and deposited in an access-restricted storage room in Site-77. SCP-755 must be examined by no less than four level 4 personnel before one may operate it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-755 is a bullet-shaped object of unknown composition, weighing approximately one gram. The exterior has been constructed from a type of aluminum which appears to be indestructible, and is covered with a non-reflective coating. SCP-755's interior is lined with an unknown material which appears to be the remains of an artificial biological organism, dismembered into several components (including "brains") which form the firing mechanism for SCP-755. DNA analysis has revealed that this organism had at least a rudimentary nervous system.</p><p>SCP-755 was recovered on board SCP-093 after it crash landed in Siberia during a test flight by experimental aircraft VZN-7XX, piloted by ██████ ████. SCP-095 was being used as a hanger by the Foundation following its discovery in 1967, and investigations into its origin are currently underway.</p><p>When loaded with the appropriate ammunition (see Addendum), SCP-755 will fire bullets constructed from the remains of the organism loaded into it, hitting and penetrating any material up to three (3) meters away. Bullets produced by SCP-755 have not been found to be affected by gravity; bullets fired from SCP-755 also appear to be capable of passing through solid metal objects unimpeded. Bullets fired from SCP-755 do not seem to create any detectable heat upon impact; this may be due to the fact that they are composed mainly of holy water. No previous ammunition simulations have shown evidence of aging or deterioration for bullets created using SCP-755, indicating that the entity behind their production does not age or decay. Agents assigned to Project: 755 were supplied with blank ammunition before testing began.</p><p>Special Containment Procedures: When transported from the storage room, SCP-755 must be kept in a hardwood container lined with lead plates attached via carpenter's glue. A lead plate should also be placed over the top of each bullet when stored in a gun case; this addition helps prevent accidental discharge if damaged ammunition is accidentally loaded into the weapon. If an empty cartridge case is found outside of Foundation control, it must be reported immediately, along with retrieval instructions for another specimen of SCP-755. Ammunition must never be removed from SCP-755's chamber except by testing personnel; ammunition cannot be replaced, and all evidence points to the fact that unscrewing these bullets would cause permanent damage.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Testing Log</p><p><strong>Test 755-A:</strong> On 12/07/2000, two D-Class personnel were loaded into SCP-755 and instructed to fire at a target using blank ammunition. The results of the test are as follows:</p><p>The result of this test indicates that SCP-755\'s bullets have no effect on living organisms; the bullets produced by SCP-755 in this test, however, dissipated before striking the test subject. When asked to explain their failure, the subject claimed to have "forgotten" which way was up.</p><p><strong>Test 755-B:</strong> On 07/29/2001, three D-Class personnel were loaded into SCP-755 and instructed to fire at a target using blank ammunition. The results of the test are as follows:</p><p>As expected, the bullets created from SCP-755 did not affect the test subjects. One of the subjects was observed to be vomiting throughout the testing process; the subject showed no other outward signs of ill health after being removed from SCP-755.</p><p><strong>Test 755-C:</strong> On 07/30/2001, eight D-Class personnel were loaded into SCP-755 and instructed to fire at a target using blank ammunition. The results of the test are as follows:</p><p>The failure of this test is due to the fact that all of the bullets produced by SCP-755 detonated on impact with the center of the target\'s head, resulting in severe brain damage and loss of consciousness for all test subjects.</p>
