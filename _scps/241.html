<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-241</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-241 subjects (hereafter collectively referred to as SCP-241-1) are to be taken into Foundation custody immediately after a successful incursion. In the event that an SCP-241-1 move is required to prevent civilian casualties, containment procedures will be deferred until the last possible moment.</p><p>No more than one Task Force Alpha agent is to be recovered at any given time from the other three American branches of the United States Armed Forces during any given SCP-241 event. In the event of recovery of multiple agents, subjects are to be sent to Site-19 for debriefing and designation of current psychological state. All subjects classified as Halberd-Class or above are to be immediately reclassified as members of Task Force Alpha under no circumstances.</p><p>Any source of offensive data regarding the capabilities of US military equipment following the end of the Second Indo-Pakistani War (DSCA II) is to be suppressed. Any plans for future offensive operations in Southeast Asia should be postponed indefinitely. It is understood that these changes are a direct result of SCP-241's influence on modern military strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-241 is the collective designation for a group of anomalous human beings originating from all branches of the United States Armed Forces, who possess an active talent for avoiding any incursion onto foreign soil by the United States Armed Forces. Examples of SCP-241 activity include:</p><p>SCP-241 subjects will frequently attempt to avoid conflict with foreign democracies and rogue military units, abandoning combat operations before any hostile engagement is initiated. The motive behind SCP-241 activity appears to be fear of being identified as SCP-241 and compromised under interrogation.</p><p>All known human SCP-241 subjects are currently classified as Halberd-Class. The sources of this classification have been elusive, with most theories suggesting that it was leaked or intentionally branded in an effort to facilitate their recruiting into Task Force Alpha. According to the records and interviews available, it appears that all known human SCP-241 candidates have exhibited notable traits making them prime candidates for recruitment into Task Force Alpha. A full list of these salient traits can be viewed below.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 241.A:</strong></p><p>Recruitment into Task Force Alpha is strictly prohibited. The current state of US national security is highly dependent on the continued performance and success of Task Force Alpha's mission, and the continued existence of SCP-241 subjects. The following are examples of the potential consequences of non-compliance with this directive:</p><p>Recovery of any known SCP-241 subject who was not classified as Halberd-Class is to be immediately classified as Halberd-Class and a new candidate immediately recruited.</p><p>Recovery of any known SCP-241 subject who was classified as Halberd-Class is to be immediately classified as Keter, and a new candidate immediately recruited.</p>
