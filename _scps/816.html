<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-816</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-816 is to be held in a storage locker at Site One when not being used. Four (4) security officers are to be stationed armed with automatic weapons in the lobby of the site 24/7. Any civilian or Foundation personnel entering or exiting this area is to undergo scrutiny by on-site security and undergo a search for SCP-816.</p><p>All wandering civilians found to be holding SCP-816 are to be detained as if they were carrying a firearm and brought directly to the nearest security post, where they will be interviewed and searched again. When inactive and not being used by a test subject, SCP-816 is to be kept away from all other objects in facility storage that are classified as high risk, such as those weapons dealing with anomalous materials.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-816 appears to be a square of concrete, measuring 6.25m on each side and 1.5m thick at its base, with a square hole in the center approximately 2cm deep. The object was dropped off the back of a crane some time ago, but due to SCP-816's extreme unusual properties it was never recovered. After research was reinstated and SCP-816 was discovered, security personnel from Site One attempted to dispose of it using standard containment procedures.</p><p>Any person who touches SCP-816 with non-anomalous hands will begin experiencing intense nausea. Any attempts to dislodge these hands will result in them being unable to move for up to ten seconds after leaving the item behind. Despite this, SCP-816 does not seem very heavy or pose any hindrance when held by non-anomalous hands.</p><p>When in the possession of an anomalous individual, SCP-816 will begin showing light patterns inside it. These patterns are also projected onto any clothing worn by subjects holding SCP-816, and appear as a cross between a neon sign and fractals that change speed depending on how much they are moved around while still gripped by them.</p><p>SCP-816 was discovered during an experiment carried out by Researcher Smith and Dr. Belden on the 57th day after an initial containment breach by Agent ████████ ████████████ involving the use of relatively large amounts of firearms powder. The pair had been planning to test the effects of multiple firearms outside a Foundation facility when they were ambushed by three armed men wearing gas masks who quickly missed their shots before throwing flashbang grenades which prevented Researcher Smith from successfully tracking down the source of gunfire he heard earlier in his experiment.</p><p>As Researcher Smith dashed towards Site One's emergency exits, he noticed several flashes from its roof which seemed to come from nowhere and followed one user producing a handgun from under his coat before moving away from him twice as fast as he had been running previously before blacking out despite his best efforts to keep up with the pattern that appeared on his shirt whenever he moved or jumped over obstacles.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
