<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-937</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-937 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with the following modifications:</p><p>Any members of the Foundation may request access to SCP-937 for testing; no personnel shall possess any knowledge of SCP-937's anomalous properties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-937 is a pair of steel shears. One of the shears is a standard item, measuring 30 cm in length. The second shear is missing an inch of its blade; it measures 32 cm.</p><p>In the event that a human subject tries to use the missing blade of SCP-937 on a living sapient organism (except other sapient organisms), the entity will manifest one or more instance(s) of SCP-937. Instance(s) will immediately terminate the subject and harvest any available organs, though instances are not capable of harvesting brain tissue, due to their inability to penetrate the skull.</p><p>When a specimen has been harvested through SCP-937's anomalous properties, it will be packaged separately from the original severed limbs, and labelled "Poultry." Upon being opened, the packaging will contain no internal organs; however, it will contain leg(s) with patchy skin and feathers attached. If cut open, the specimen will uniformly consist of cartilage fibers, tendons and muscular tissue; an absence of blood and viscera indicates that all internal organs have been harvested by instances of SCP-937.</p><p>A single instance can process up to 10 specimens per day; specimens which have only partial limbs are particularly inefficient at this task.</p><p>SCP-937 was recovered from [REDACTED] Farm in [REDACTED], Ohio on 11/12/1989 after reports that a man had fainted and he died minutes later caused Foundation Agents to respond to the scene. The cause of death was confirmed as cardiac arrest due to intestinal obstruction caused by pulled entrails forcibly removed from his abdominal cavity. It was discovered that an individual known as Mr. ██████████ had been hired by Mr. ██████████'s wife to cut various fruits and vegetables for their family meal; upon discovering what had happened, Mrs. ██████████ committed suicide by hanging herself in their backyard treehouse twenty minutes later. Mr. ██████████ admitted having left his farm during his lunch break on 11/11/1989; further investigation showed that he had used SCP-937's anomalous properties multiple times before being terminated by its intact counterpart (see Testing Log 937-1).</p><p>After investigation at Mr. ██████████'s home revealed no additional instances of SCP-937 or similar instruments, it was found that Mr. ██████████ had possessed SCP-173 prior to 9/11/1993 (see Test Log 937-2). It was concluded that SCP-173's anomalous properties had been responsible for spawning instances of SCP-937; however, it still remains unclear if SCP-173 manipulated Mr. ██████████ into using objects with anomalous properties.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
