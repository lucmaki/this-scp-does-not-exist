<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-176</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe-Site</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-176 is to be monitored and guarded by on-site security personnel. No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-176 without approval of Site-██ command authority.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-176 is a containment chamber comprised of five separate rooms. Each room contains a chair, a desk, and a chalkboard with a message scrawled on it in black ink. The messages vary from room to room since each is written by an individual.</p><p>The contents of the messages range from threats of violence towards the personnel inside SCP-176 to pleas for help. When no more subjects are available for testing, the message on SCP-176 will change to reflect subject’s current mood and feeling about the experience.</p><p>When subjects enter SCP-176, they will find their designated classroom within the facility. However, all equipment used inside SCP-176 will be in disarray, as if they had not been used even once before.</p><p>SCP-176 was discovered when several staff members reported experiencing similar phenomena while working late at night at Site-██. Investigation revealed that SCP-176 was operational and not a result of psychological stress on the part of Site-██ personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 176-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, Dr. ██████████ and Dr. ████████████ were the only two personnel present at Site-██. They were sitting in the cafeteria having coffee and discussing the current events of the Foundation when they suddenly found themselves in SCP-176.</p><p>After examining the room they were in and finding it completely empty, they noticed what appeared to be a chalkboard with a message written on it. The message read, “Have you ever been mad at someone you love? I was.”</p><p>Dr. ████████ then proceeded to explain to Dr. ██████████ the events that led him to becoming the subject of SCP-176. Dr. ██████████ became extremely emotional after hearing this story and was wiped out for several hours before being able to return to his office.']</p>
