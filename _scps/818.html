<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-818 is to be held in a sealed chamber at Site-15, outside of all regular containment procedures. Remote monitoring devices are to be installed around SCP-818 at all times.</p><p>SCP-818 is to be fed once every five days via feeding tube, with the feeding tube being replaced every two days in order to keep the object from growing any further. The feeding tube is to be cleaned and replaced after each meal.</p><p>It is recommended that SCP-818 be fed a small amount of blood serum each week in order to avoid overexertion of the digestive system. In addition, SCP-818 is also to receive basic maintenance treatments once a week.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-818 is a humanoid organism weighing in at [DATA EXPUNGED], proportioned to resemble the human form. SCP-818 possesses no internal organs, including a digestive system. Instead, SCP-818 stores glucose and other nutrients in its body cavities and serves as an advanced food storage unit.</p><p>SCP-818 is composed of a number of 'skins', each covering different organs and appendages. These skins are designed to resemble cut sections of various fruits and vegetables, while also having various metallic components.</p><p>When not fed or otherwise pressed, SCP-818 will maintain its base shape, however the skinned fruit and vegetable appearances will vary greatly based on the mood and dietary aspects of the entity.</p><p>Below are some examples of the fleshly forms SCP-818 takes:</p><p>Diet: Fruit Mango Peach Watermelon Tomato Pineapple Orange (Before being separated from its digestion system)</p><p>Mood: Carefree Energetic Hungry Angry Sadstonished Excited Constantly Woesome Always Hazy Bewildered Vaguely Unfamiliar Curious Aloof Assertive Disinterested Annoyed</p><p>Wishes: A pineapple that can produce more fruit so it never has too much to eat. Human flesh for protein so it never has to eat again. The sunlight to stop being kept alive by crude artificial methods.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
