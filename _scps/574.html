<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-574</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-574 is to be kept in a high security storage locker in Site-64. It is to be opened only on request from at least two (2) Level 4 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-574 is a trophy made of brass. It is approximately 3 cm in height and 2.5 cm in diameter, and has a red disc attached to the top of it. The disc is engraved with the phrase "Last Place Trophy".</p><p>Any adult human that comes within 5 meters of SCP-574 will be transported to the school they were attending when they were twelve years old, except for those who attended public schools.</p><p>SCP-574 was recovered during an operation initiated at ███████ Elementary School in ██████████, which was discovered to be hosting a discretely large number of human anomalies. ██████████ Elementary School has been closed down, and all staff members and students removed from the premises.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 574-1:</strong> Incident Report</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/1997</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Dr. █████</p><p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Test A was conducted using SCP-574 in San Diego, California. Test A involved a D-class personnel being instructed to remove SCP-574 from a showcase, and return it to its box. D-1250 was instructed to carry this out. D-1250 reported being transported back to the school he attended for four consecutive days. When asked how he felt about this, D-1250 replied "I\'m not mad, but I\'ve been here long enough that I\'m starting to get sick of it." The test was terminated after this point.</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/1998</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-2276</p><p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> D-2276 was instructed to use SCP-574 in a standard test of transportational capability by reattaching it to the glass case. During transport, D-2276 claimed to have "jokingly" decided that SCP-574 should be moved out and replaced with an unknown object. SCP-574 appeared on top of the pedestal as before, and all movement ceased. After approximately five minutes of no motion, all motion resumed. Testing was halted when SCP-574 began glowing intensely and emitting an extremely loud (99 decibels) squeaking sound. All personnel present safely evacuated the room via teleporters and fire alarms were activated immediately. Upon entering the room again after the fire alarms had been shut off, it was observed that all buildings within a 1\xa0km radius of the site had suffered structural damage consistent with periodic earthquakes.</p>
