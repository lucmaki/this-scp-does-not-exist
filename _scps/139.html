<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-139</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-139 is to be kept in a locked locker at Site-77. Any personnel wishing to see SCP-139 may request permission from the level 3 medical staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-139 is a black, Anoyo Petite pen1 with a bright red tip. In addition, SCP-139 possesses a visible window opening onto the next page. The window can be opened by pressing down on the button at the base of SCP-139.</p><p>It takes no longer than five seconds after subjecting oneself to SCP-139 to realize that it is highly mundane and uninteresting. Upon reaching this realization, the subject will begin to explore its surroundings to try to find any intrigue or interest in its "landscape".</p><p>When a subject discovers something which causes them to feel admiration for it or wonder about it, they will hear the phrase "Is That Doable?" spoken by an unknown speaker.</p><p>After this happens, the subject will be unable to look away from an object within their peripheral vision. Said object is then revealed to be an instance of SCP-███. If said subject looks away from the object, they will find themselves at a random location in Site-77. If they do not attempt to look away from the object, they will continue visiting locations in Site-77 until they are instructed to leave by the same speaker they heard speaking earlier. This process has been observed to happen hundreds of times before ending abruptly.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> In light of SCP-███ being reclassified as Safe on █/██/1990, these procedures have been updated to reflect this change.']</p>
