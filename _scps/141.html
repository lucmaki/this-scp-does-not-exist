<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-141</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-141 is to be contained in Containment Locker 23 of Site-22. Personnel coming in direct contact with SCP-141 are to wear full personal protection equipment (a standard two-piece suit and rubber googles) upon entering the containment area. Personnel with respiratory implants may wear them during interaction.</p><p>SCP-141 needs periodic charging, and once every 30 days a Class-III personnel has to enter the containment area, connect the charge cable to SCP-141, and perform any necessary maintenance procedures on it. Each time a maintenance procedure is completed and reassessed, the maintenance schedule is increased by one day, up to a maximum of eight days.</p><p>A Class-III personnel should also check for faults as well as perform inspections of all electrical installations that have been connected to SCP-141 if it happens to be disconnected from power. The initial maintenance schedule is to be maintained by an Onsite Supervisor and an Onsite Supervisor must do any necessary repairs. Any malfunctions are to be reported immediately; any suspected accidents, or dangerous conditions, risk immediate containment breach.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-141 is a portable electric generator, one meter tall, with an engine. It has also been equipped with a state of the art HD video recorder that is integrated into its square front panel. A black leather strap underneath the generator's handle section allows carrying the generator by hand. SCP-141 weighs 73 kg. The front display screen shows information related to SCP-141's condition, and when SCP-141 is active, it displays some kind of test footage produced by the recording device.</p><p>SCP-141 was recovered in ████████, Ukraine, along with several other antiques and items found in abandoned buildings. All items were left behind by Agent ████ who was sent on a mission to retrieve them; he was able to evade police and escape, but Foundation agents were able to capture him before he could reach his hiding place. He subsequently confessed his participation in the incident, providing detailed information on how SCP-141 came into Foundation custody.</p><p>During the investigation stage, it was determined that SCP-141 was capable of producing electricity even when outside of power supply. Testing revealed that SCP-141 is able to produce 45 c/s (coulomb per second) of energy at its maximum capacity under optimal conditions. However, as long as it is supplied with current from an external source (i.e., a power outlet), it can continue working indefinitely; thus, any maintenance procedure is not required for SCP-141's functionality once it leaves its source of power.</p><p>Originally recovered in a seemingly empty warehouse where the last owner had apparently been living for many years ("…He used to be employed as an engineer or something at ██████████ Engineering Company", "…"I don't even remember what his name was", "…We never spent much time together…we wouldn't even talk"), SCP-141 has been of minimal interest until ████ ██████ lost consciousness while operating SCP-141 in an attempt to demonstrate its abilities at a local school talent show. Agents sent there discovered five people unconscious in the remains of what appeared to be a disused building: three adults and two children (aged 36 and 16 respectively); all had severe burns due to electrical leakage from SCP-141 ("He [Agent ████] lost consciousness for about 15 seconds because of electrocution…but still managed to connect SCP-141 before falling down", "…His hand seemed like he just pressed the button on a remote control", "The entire room filled with sparks and fire; he collapsed after sometime,"). When questioned by Agent ████████ whether they were anything out of the ordinary ("We didn't see nothing strange anywhere else in there…"), they all claimed they did not know what had happened, until Agent ████ took Billie ████████ aside and named her "Billie █████". She then explained that she knew Agent ████ since she was 8 years old and they would often chat while playing outside their homes; she also claimed that one day few years ago she met him through her older brother who went to work at the same facility as prior owner (though it still remained unclear whether this was real or not).</p><p>[…]then I looked over at another side table near us and saw this little blue paper thing…I asked if I could borrow it for a second because I couldn't believe my eyes…then we both made our way back home with this paper thing."</p><p>"They showed him a piece of paper that read 'Handprint' and blood spatters on it." -Dr. Borisov.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum SCP-141-1:</strong> SCP-141 was recovered in ██████, Ukraine, where the last owner of SCP-141 was located. As it turned out, the last owner's name was ████████████ and he used to work as an engineer at ██████████ Engineering Company in which he had a close friendship with his colleague. It is unclear whether ████████████ and his colleague were still alive when SCP-141 went missing, or if they died prior to its disappearance."]</p>
