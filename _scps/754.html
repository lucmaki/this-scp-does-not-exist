<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-754</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-754 is held in a standard non-containment safe at Site-██. The object is to be stored with a fully charged battery and at least one spare charged battery. Containment procedures are to be followed before use of SCP-754.</p><p>Personnel reporting symptoms of SCP-754 poisoning may be quarantined for two weeks after exposure, and must report to the Site-██ Medical Officer. Due to limited supplies, it will not be possible to isolate every affected individual. This restriction is imposed to avoid spreading SCP-754 infection among Foundation staff and civilians.</p><p>Any personnel who go missing en route to Site-██ following exposure to SCP-754 are to be presumed lost in the woods until their bodies are found or their whereabouts determined using an alternative means of locating missing persons.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-754 is a Swiss Army knife, with the words "PHOTOGRAPHE" and "SURVEILLANCE" on the handle.</p><p>When an individual uses SCP-754 to operate the camera, SCP-754 will record seven seconds of video before recording a sound file of that individual's voice saying "Yes, one more." When viewed later, the video will show a forest scene. The sound file is comprised of random sounds of nature, such as leaves rustling through the trees.</p><p>While SCP-754 is in use, any missing persons reported or discovered are assumed to have perished while attempting to access SCP-754's usage capabilities. As no ID can be found on the person, it is assumed that they were already missing before entering the woods during the time period when their body was not found. Mobile phone and GPS signals from missing persons are interrupted near the site where bodies are recovered; there are no known instances where a surviving victim's cellphone or GPS has been located at a different location. This effect does not appear to apply to corpses; for instance, if a person dies in New York City and their body is taken to Site-██ for containment, it should be presumed that he/she died in New York City.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
