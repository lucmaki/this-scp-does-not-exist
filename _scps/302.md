<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-302</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-302's former containment area has been converted into a small community park and is to be patrolled by two Foundation agents twenty four hours a day. Community access to SCP-302 has been restricted to daytime.</p><p>In the event of civilian casualties, Foundation personnel must wait at least 10 minutes before entering a safe zone outside of SCP-302's area of effect.</p><p>Currently, no permanent Foundation personnel are stationed in Area-18; all personnel are assigned to Area-01, Area-02 or Area-03.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-302 is a landscape sculpture by American artist Roy De Forest. The form of SCP-302 appears to be a giant peach. SCP-302's area of effect consists of the mountains near Area-18, including ██████ National Park and the surrounding area.</p><p>SCP-302 (designated SCP-302A) displays anomalous behavior when it is within a 3km radius of Areas 18 & 18a, designated Area-18. When SCP-302A is within range of an individual human subject within Area-18 (roughly 1km radius), the construct will display anomalous properties.</p><p>When actively affected, SCP-302A will produce sounds that vary in pitch and contain both language and pronounceable sounds, as well as text written in languages such as Chinese, Russian and English. Audio signals are reproduced with sufficient clarity that they can be understood by human beings. If an individual is able to fully scan the area around them, they will see what appear to be physical landscapes made of concrete or stone that significantly resemble the appearance of ██████ National Park (Area 18a) or [DATA EXPUNGED]. These landscapes resemble natural rock formations which occasionally change size or shape, though they always remain roughly humanoid in shape when viewed from a particular vantage point. When viewed from another vantage point, these landscapes have been observed to change into entirely different designs with similar appearances. Furthermore, messages written on these landscapes have been determined to be similar in content to those written on SCP-302A.</p><p>If a human subject comes within 300 meters of SCP-302A, they will begin experiencing auditory hallucinations consisting of the following:</p><p>SCP-302 is capable of moving through its area of effect during daylight hours.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> The following text was found written on a flat surface in the center of SCP-302A.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Hello, my name is Roy De Forest, and this is my artwork!</p><p>I hope you enjoy it, and if you do please use it for your own purposes.</p><p>I'm here to make art for people who love art. I am a sculptor, and a painter.</p><p>I love making art that makes people happy.</p><p>Please feel free to contact me at the address below.</p><p>Scientists have been trying to figure out what this place is for years, but I just make art here.</p><p>Don't try to find me; I'll be here until the end of time.</p><p>Thank you for reading this, and please enjoy my work."]</p>
