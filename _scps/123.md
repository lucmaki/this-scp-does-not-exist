SCP-123 instances are to be held at Containment Unit-944 (currently under construction).</p>

Attempts to locate and capture these entities have proven unsuccessful.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 123-1:</strong> SCP-123 was first discovered in 1994 by Agent ██████ of the FDA. During routine inspection of a shipment of Trix cereal, she noted that the advertisement on the back of the cereal box was abnormal. On closer inspection, she noted that one panel on the back of the box had been torn off and written on. Upon closer inspection, Agent ██████ discovered that the writing was written in a language unknown to her. Further experience in the language and an analysis of the writing led to its identification as an encrypted message; "I like cereal". Upon further analysis, it was determined that this message had been written on all advertisements for Trix cereal since 1978.']</p>
