<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-275</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The remaining portions of SCP-275 are to be stored in a secure containment locker at Site-66, accessed only by Level 3 personnel. Personnel must be issued clearance through the Site-66 administration office and also rated as Dopplegangers to access the locker. The locker is to be kept in a standard security locker room with no access to the outside. A combination lock may be used when access is required, and should remain unchanged between uses.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-275 designates the remains of Hector de Frutos, J.D., of the 23rd Marine Regiment, 2nd Division in Cuba.</p><p>SCP-275 is a Scrapbook of photographs, newspaper clippings and other miscellaneous items collected by De Frutos (henceforth referred to as SCP-275-1). When viewed outside of the anomaly, it appears to be several pieces of papers taped together with photos glued inside. The pages are made from various papers from different sources.</p><p>When viewing an item within the anomaly, it will appear similar to when viewed outside, but with minor alterations. The SCP-275 has proven capable of altering photographs quite well, and has been known to photograph things that have never been photographed before. The item itself is not altered when viewed within the anomaly; however, the information contained within is altered into a more believable scenario. This includes the picture's history being forgotten and no further evidence remaining about it.</p><p>Items that are 'Forever Forgotten' and located in at least one country will be displayed at their correct date and location. Items that are 'Possibly Forgotten' or 'Maybe Forgotten' can only be displayed during a time period in which they were either very well remembered or not at all remembered. For example, if a photo was forgotten after 1899, then all variants will show 1899's date, regardless of the original year it was taken for comparison purposes.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
