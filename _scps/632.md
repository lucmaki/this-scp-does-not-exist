<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-632</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-632 is currently contained at Site-77 in the secure area of SCP Item Testing Wing. Personnel assigned to SCP-632 are to be kept away from any unsecured artwork, and have been made aware that they will be terminated if they attempt to display 632 outside of a secure area. The viewport in which the item is contained has been modified to prevent any direct visual contact with SCP-632.</p><p>SCP-632 has been marked as being used in testing that must not be recorded on any level of security below clearance 4.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-632 is an artwork, currently owned and kept by Site-77. It consists of a sheet of white paper, slightly smaller than A3 size, with a black monochrome ink drawing in the center of the page. The drawing resembles a black-and-white photograph from an early camera, showing what appears to be a male humanoid in motion. The main figure is moving in a "sprinting" motion, though it has no visible feet or legs.</p><p>Upon first being presented to the Foundation, SCP-632 has been positioned at various points in the facility for testing. The item can be moved about freely within testing chambers without attracting hostile attention; however, personnel assigned to SCP-632 have reported that they always feel compelled to stay near it.</p><p>No adverse effects have been observed from exposure to SCP-632 so far. Testing on personnel assigned to SCP-632 is currently prohibited.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 632-1:</strong> SCP-632 was recovered from the home of ██████ █████████, a former Foundation agent and researcher, who had been killed in an automobile accident in 2005. The Foundation eventually located his body only after it had been exhumed.</p><p>A note was found on the body, containing only a single word: "A feeling".']</p>
