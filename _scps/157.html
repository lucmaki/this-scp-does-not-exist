<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-157</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-157 is currently kept in Secure Containment Locker ██ at Site ██. No further testing is to be performed with SCP-157.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-157 is a set of six (6) paper clips, all exactly the same size, shape and weight. Each of these paper clips still has the original packaging on it, including a picture and bar code label on one end. The text on the packaging reads: "Paper Clip for Michaels Office Depot."</p><p>SCP-157 was originally discovered in ██/██/19██, when two newly hired associates at ████████ office supply store began complaining about a strange and unusual item that had been appearing in their deliveries. After two pairs of investigators attempted to retrieve it from its packing, SCP-157 disappeared along with the package.</p><p>No one has been able to find any trace of where SCP-157 came from after the packaging and item were taken away by the delivery man. However, according to the store's inventory records, this package was sold until ██/██/██, when it disappeared as well. Even though each of the items had gone missing before they could be linked back to their specific time period, all records show that they were generally sold over 6 months apart.</p><p>Both shipments included only five (5) items at a time, never more than six (6). All six (6) items have always been the same thing. Each shipment was sent in a plain white envelope labeled "Paper Clip", with no return address on it. Each time that Paper Clip was sold it went out at different times of day and different locations within the store itself.</p>
