<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-660</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-660 is stored in a soundproof, climate-controlled room at Site-██. SCP-660 may be removed from the containment chamber for testing purposes without authorisation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-660 is an ornate, silver-grey teleprompter. Testing has shown that the device can display information to the subject's eyes and speech to the subject's mouth with no noticeable delay. When used in this manner, the object reads words and phrases at a rate of approximately 100 words per minute (WPM).</p><p>SCP-660 displays its function as "Hillary Clinton for President?" on a multi-coloured LCD screen within its casing. The device's control system allows the user to programme speech to be displayed in a variety of languages, including Russian and German. This feature was activated by [DATA EXPUNGED], who exhibited behavioural changes consistent with those seen in former Presidential candidate Senator ██████ ██████ upon first use of SCP-660 . SCP-660's control system also appears to have been programmed to accept credit card data for use on an online fundraising platform.</p><p>When testing SCP-660's ability to display human faces, D-class personnel appear to project their own image; they were not aware of this effect until informed of it by Drs. ████████ and ███████.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-660's control system appears to be capable of subverting its own digital encryption, allowing access to its online fundraising platform. The data accessed includes the names and addresses of ████ persons, most of whom are assumed to be campaign volunteers or staff. The encrypted files have been released into the public domain following a Foundation intervention.</p><p>The Foundation is currently tracking down the origins of these donations.</p>
