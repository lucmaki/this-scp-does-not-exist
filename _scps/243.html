<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-243</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-243 is currently contained in a standard office desk drawer at Site-██. No special precautions are required in order to contain SCP-243 itself as it poses no immediate threat to any living entity.</p><p>SCP-243 is currently classified as a Safe object due to its appearance, which poses no present threat to any living creature. The only known way of opening the lid of SCP-243 is through the use of an ordinary key. Further research into this particular limitation is currently ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-243 is the name of an office desk drawer, currently located at Site-██. SCP-243 appears to be a standard desk drawer with a normal keylock on the bottom. However, once the lid is opened and closed, it displays no long-term effect on its contents; any documents contained within SCP-243 will return to their original state in about 24 hours.</p><p>Documents contained within SCP-243 do not display any anomalous effects until they are first returned to their rightful place. This window of time usually lasts from 12 to 24 hours from the time of sending back an object until the object returns to its original state. Documents that have not been located for 30 days are considered "lost" and are disposed of.</p><p>SCP-242 does not appear to capture or display any patterns or trends within its effect; however, there is no way to avoid returning objects to their natural state. Once returned, all documents inside SCP-242 will return to their original placement within 24 hours regardless of how they were originally placed into SCP-242 (i.e.: if they were stuck by hand, they could still have been placed into SCP-242 through a desk drawer).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-243 was discovered when Dr. ███████, who was in charge of the research project dealing with SCP-████, noticed a strange anomaly occurring during his experiments.</p><p>During one particular experiment, Dr. ███████ attempted to place a photo of himself into SCP-243, but the photo was never recorded into the document within SCP-243. After some time had passed, Dr. ███████ attempted to place another picture into SCP-243, but the picture also disappeared after 24 hours had passed. After this incident, it became clear that the object in question was not a normal desk drawer.</p><p>After further testing and research into SCP-243, Dr. ███████ introduced himself to Site Director █████████ and informed him of the situation.</p><p>After receiving approval from Site Director █████████, Dr. ███████ began working on an official documentation of SCP-243 which he eventually finished in September of 1969.</p>
