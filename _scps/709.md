<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-709</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All information related to SCP-709 is to be kept from the public at all cost. Foundation assets have been deployed to every major city in the world to monitor for any instances of manifestations of SCP-709, regardless of location. Under no circumstances are any records of SCP-709 or its effects to be released to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-709 is a phenomenon in which advertisements will randomly appear on various surfaces in the world. Instances of SCP-709 display anomalous properties, and can only be seen and heard by sensitive individuals such as researchers working for the Foundation. The advertisement displayed by SCP-709 instances is, by all means, an extremely cheap advertisement for a product of apparently no value to the consumer.</p><p>While not every instance of SCP-709 leads to an amnestic object manifesting when read, less than 0.2% do so. Fortunately, these objects act more or less as ordinary advertisements, with a minor effect on consumer behavior that is usually negligible at first, leading to their subsequent removal from the market within a few months.</p><p>SCP-709 was discovered by Foundation agents among a large number of advertisements located outside London. After investigation via surveillance and codewords, it was found to be an alternate reality version of this series of events.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following transcript was recovered from the memories of Dr. █████████, a Foundation researcher on assignment to the New York City office.</p><p>"God, this guy\'s got a headache," Dr. █████████ thought to himself as he made his way to the hospital. Of course, his memory of this thought is a bit hazy at this point, but for the purpose of our investigation we will assume that it was indeed true.</p><p>"I wonder if my head\'s about to explode," he thought again. There was no sense in over-analyzing things in his opinion.</p><p>"Is that an advertisement?" Dr. █████████ mentally asked, pointing to an advertisement of a tear-inducing brand of soap above a trash can. He had worked in New York for quite some time, and was well aware of the fact that this advertisement would not appear in their city, due to the fact that there was no such product.</p><p>"Oh, shit," Dr. █████████ thought as he saw another advertisement, only this time he realized what it was; it was an advertisement for a brand of soap called "Hardened", and it had been advertised on billboards all throughout London.</p><p>Dr. █████████ looked around frantically, trying to find more advertisements of "Hardened". There were none in sight, save one outside his hospital room\'s window. He quickly opened it and began reading the advertisement.</p><p>"We\'ve taken all the good stuff out of this stuff and put it into our new line of products! Try our Hardened soap at your local drug store!" Dr. █████████ read aloud to himself, wondering why they didn\'t just call it "Mega-mild", or a similarly bland name instead of "Hardened", but decided not to give them any more credit than they deserved for their advertising skills.</p><p>He closed the window and continued down the hallway towards his room, now finding himself by his hospital room door.</p><p>"Oh well," Dr. █████████ thought as he opened the door, "that should keep my head clear enough until I get some sleep."</p><p>When Dr. █████████ looked into his room he saw what appeared to be a normal person standing with their back turned to him by his bedside table. Upon closer examination, he found that the person was wearing a suit and holding what appeared to be a bottle of "Hardened" soap in his hand, which he was vigorously scrubbing onto the back of his neck with both hands.</p><p>Taking hold of the bottle with both hands and shaking it violently, causing a large amount of soap to fly out on impact with the floor, Dr. █████████ demanded to know who they were before passing out from shock and pain.']</p>
