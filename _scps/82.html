<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-82</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-82 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. SCP-82 may only be removed from the containment locker for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-82 is a closed, white curtain measuring approximately 150cm x 150cm. SCP-82 shows no signs of wear or damage, despite testing which clearly show that it has been opened and closed dozens of times.</p><p>When it is held open for more than five minutes, SCP-82 will automatically close itself. When held in the closed position for more than ten minutes, SCP-82 will begin to heat up until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius. At this point, all matter within SCP-82 will begin to liquify. This is believed to be caused by SCP-82's anomalous effect of being able to store heat over a considerable period of time. The inferno produced by this event quickly extinguishes itself after only one minute.</p><p>SCP-82 was recovered on ██/██/████ following reports of a series of fires set in [REDACTED]. Subsequent investigation has shown that the fire had been triggered by an unknown individual who had been attempting to produce SCP-82's effect using [REDACTED].</p><p>If an individual is requested to hold open SCP-82 for five minutes, then the item will not spontaneously close.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-82 was initially recovered after a wild goose chase to the ████████ residence. The request was made by a Foundation researcher who had been investigating [REDACTED] at the time. It is suspected that this researcher was involved in the creation of SCP-82's anomalous properties.</p><p>At the time of writing, there are no plans to [REDACTED]."]</p>
