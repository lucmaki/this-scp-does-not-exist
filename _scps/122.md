<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-122</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The perimeter of SCP-122 is to be monitored with auditory stimuli. Personnel are to respond if they detect an interaction with the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-122 is a class D object. The perimeter of the object has been measured to occupy roughly 2 square kilometres, but no clear boundary can be discerned.</p><p>SCP-122 is not affected by gravity and is able to generate sounds of varying intensity and volume throughout the area. These sounds do not exist in any time or space outside of the perimeter of SCP-122, but are capable of being heard by human subjects inside the perimeter at extremely high volumes with little warning.</p><p>When an individual in contact with SCP-122 hears a sound, they will hear all of those sounds simultaneously in their head with no ability to distinguish individual frequencies produced by mechanical devices such as speakers or recordings, although they are capable of distinguishing notes if they are knowledgeable about music composition.</p><p>Individuals who have experienced this effect have reported feeling dizzy and nauseous after when it subsides, presumably from having taken in too much information for their body to process. Additionally, due to the lack of variation in the sounds produced by SCP-122, individuals typically experience difficulty sleeping once they are removed from the psychological effects of having been within its sphere.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 122:</strong> SCP-122 was discovered in ██████, Washington, USA, on 04/19/2000 by Agent ██████ while surveying anomalous objects. Agents had observed a number of events involving SCP-122 before it was brought into Foundation custody.</p><p>Immediately after the discovery, Foundation agents were dispatched to locate the source of the sound. Upon arrival, they were presented with a large crowd of civilians and local law enforcement attempting to prevent the public from entering the area. Agents were able to convince the crowd that they were investigating a possible bomb threat and managed to clear a path through without incident.</p><p>When they arrived at the perimeter of SCP-122, however, they found several individuals standing on the object's surface who had been subdued by the sounds it produced. When questioned, these subjects claimed to have no prior knowledge of the object or its effects and pleaded for assistance in removing themselves from its influence.</p><p>The subject was unable to be removed from its influence by any means available to Foundation personnel and was transferred to Site-██ for observation. The subjects fell out of contact with reality when removed from the object, although their memories remained intact."]</p>
