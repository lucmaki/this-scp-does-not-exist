<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-419</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-419 is to be held in a safe storage unit at Site-19. No personnel are to be allowed to view SCP-419 directly. All documentation related to SCP-419 must be sanitized and destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-419 is a computer disc containing a file named history.dat. This file contains over 200,000 lines of data, with an average length of 60 characters and a maximum length of approximately 600 characters.</p><p>The first entry on any page of the file (hereafter referred to as the "initial page") has no name; however, upon reading past it, the entries will refer to the initial page by name. The first initial page is numbered 0 and is the only initial page that can be read by any human subject not under the effects of SCP-419.</p><p>Reading past this first entry typically causes a psychiatric distress in subjects not under the effects of SCP-419; however, some subjects are unaffected by this effect (hereafter referred to as "immune" subjects) and proceed to read past the entry despite knowing they will be affected by it. All immune subjects have reported severe emotional distress upon reading past this first entry and have described two separate entities vowing vengeance on each other for reasons unknown.</p><p>Upon reaching any other line following the initial page, all subsequent lines are interpreted as commands issued by one entity to another entities. Although most commands appear to be normal English commands such as "stop," "put", etc., there are very few repeated words or strings of words. It is believed that these repeated words represent encoded instructions regarding SCP-419 itself or its use, but due to its highly repetitive nature it is currently impossible to determine what instructions may be hidden in each individual word.</p><p>Decoded instructions from SCP-419 messages will cause immediate and irreversible damage to objects using certain methods specified in the message. Several examples are given below:</p><p>Documents describing experiments involving SCP-419 have been seized from several UBE laboratories, Foundation properties, and sites related to SCP-419 research and development. Posthumously granted amnesties have been issued for all personnel involved in such operations.</p>
