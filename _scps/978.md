<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-978</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-978 is stored in a standard Safe-class storage locker at Site-19. Testing of SCP-978 requires Level 3/9 approval.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-978 is a ceramic bowl, roughly 3 cm in diameter, with no markings or inscriptions on it. Testing has revealed the bowl to be structurally sound and free from any manufacturing defects. The bowl was manufactured at ████████, China, in the year ██ BC. The bowl's decorative motifs are typical for Chinese ceramics of the era; the bowl is therefore believed to have been produced by someone familiar with the art of Chinese ceramics.</p><p>At the bottom of SCP-978 is a small label reading "████ █████" (translated as "I'll tell you my name, if you tell me yours"). Attempts to remove the label have been unsuccessful. The contents of SCP-978 will not affect its structural integrity, nor cause any other damage to SCP-978. If one were to pour water into SCP-978, it would continue to retain its shape and volume.</p><p>When an individual drinks from SCP-978, he or she will be affected by SCP-978 in a manner that does not violate or contradict any known laws of physics. After drinking from SCP-978, subjects will experience a sensation of falling through varying levels of gravity. Subjects report no discomfort or pain from this effect, even when their feet touch ground after reaching extreme altitudes. Subjects feel no sensation of weightlessness even when they are several kilometers high above earth's atmosphere.</p><p>SCP-978 was recovered during ████ after reports of an unidentified flying object over ████████, China. Researchers first identified the anomaly as a Chinese ceramic jar labeled with a similar inscription; due to this confusion, researchers were unable to identify the anomaly's original owner. When Foundation agents raided ████'s nuclear power plant and discovered SCP-978 among dozens of anomalous items they requested, they immediately notified MTF Mu-10 ("The Cockroach Team") who retrieved the object.</p>
