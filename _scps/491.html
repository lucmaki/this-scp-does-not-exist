<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-491</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation maintains a database entry for SCP-491. The Foundation is not currently aware of any other instances of SCP-491.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-491 is a video game created by █████ █████. The general title appears as: "Raccoon Encouragement", with the copyright holder indicated as "PD32000".</p><p>SCP-491 is sold independently on several online marketplaces, including [REDACTED]. SCP-491 requires a Windows PC to function normally.</p><p>When one plays SCP-491, they will encounter a hooded Raccoon (hereafter referred to as SCP-491-A) who will offer helpful advice and encouragement. Given the presence of other non-anomalous raccoon video games, there appears to be no discernable pattern in which SCP-491 will appear. There has never been any hostile behavior from SCP-491-A.</p><p>SCP-491 does not affect its player in any way beyond offering them assistance. In addition, SCP-491 does not have any discernable effect on the player's behavior or cognition. However, analysis of gameplay logs have found that players experience increased attention towards the game, such that they do not notice time passing while playing.</p><p>Only one instance of SCP-491 is known to exist currently, with it located in Site ██'s containment room.</p><p>The Foundation has no knowledge of how SCP-491 came to be originally created, or if its creator possessed other instances of SCP-491 at the time of writing this document.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
