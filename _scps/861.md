<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-861</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-861 is to be stored in a standard artifact containment case composed entirely of titanium. The dimensions of SCP-861 are not to be altered; any attempt at removing SCP-861 from its box will result in the destruction of the artifact.</p><p>A fully equipped laboratory is to be constructed immediately adjacent to SCP-861’s containment chamber, and stocked with all materials necessary for conducting experiments related to human behavior. Subjects for testing must be selected from willing, able-bodied volunteers over eighteen years of age. All subjects must be informed that they will be “unfollowed” for the duration of the experiment; this is required in order to ensure that all subjects feel as though they are experiencing something genuinely abnormal.</p><p>All subjects must be restrained during testing, using heavy leather handcuffs and padded restraints, with their heads secured in place by padded headrests. Two (2) assistants are to be present in the testing chamber at all times while the test is being conducted; they are not permitted to leave their posts until the end of the experiment. A noisemaker device must be present throughout each test to ensure that subjects remain unaware of personnel outside of the testing chamber. A single camera must also be mounted in the testing chamber at all times, recording footage intended for observation by psychiatrists attempting to discern patterns between instances of SCP-861 manifestation and changes within a subject's behavior deemed worthy of further study.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-861 is a bound volume of blank paper, measuring 2.8 x 2.8 m in size and weighing ██ kg before containment. The cover of the volume is decorated with an image of a smiling human face with no apparent mouth, eyes, nose, or ears. SCP-861 was purchased at a bookstore in [DATA REDACTED] by Agent [REDACTED], who subsequently attempted to use it for the purposes of "unfollowing" his wife.</p><p>A typical test lasts approximately one (1) hour, during which SCP-861 manifests itself in three phases. After another thirty seconds have passed following the conclusion of each phase, the SCP begins to make a faint sound. This sound is identified as being made by one person within the testing chamber, and increases in intensity until audible to all observers; nobody having heard this sound before will be expected to find it disturbing.</p><p>After several minutes have passed since SCP-861’s manifestation, its pages will turn themselves to face the observers directly in their line of sight. Subjects are expected to report that they can see the written text clearly while experiencing this effect; however, no subject has reported seeing what is written on any page of SCP-861 under normal vision (flashlight or otherwise). In addition to being able to read what is written on these pages accurately, subjects are also able to speak so as not to cause confusion; subjects report that they cannot hear their own voice when experiencing SCP-861's effects.</p><p>Following this point, subjects will begin attempting to manipulate objects placed in front of them. These attempts generally involve grasping for tools available for use within the testing chamber, pushing objects away from themselves, and eventually resorting to using their feet and hands to try and break their restraints and escape via makeshift means constructed by their own bodies. Observed behaviors vary based on the status quo and current mood of the subject; behavioral modification is observed regardless of whether or not these attempts succeed.</p><p>After approximately three (3) hours into an SCP-861 test, subjects will begin spontaneously breaking equipment or other constructs placed around them during testing in order to gain access to materials necessary for freeing themselves; building small piles of ash or other detritus appearing on floors or carpets located near the subject will mark their progress towards escape. Upon reaching their goal, all subjects will have removed any additional restraints holding them down and are capable of leaving the confines of the testing chamber unharmed; all subjects appear unharmed upon leaving SCP-861's effect area unless otherwise noted by researchers present at the time.</p><p>These witnesses report no evidence of bodily injury from any means related to self-destruction or self-mutilation prior to this point; physical injuries associated with this behavior do not appear consistent with results observed during each phase of testing.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>Attention MTF Gamma-13 (Heavy Containment):</p><p>Please secure a containment lock on SCP-861 and administer standard amnestics to staff present in the area at the conclusion of your current assignment.</p><p>Researcher ██████, Site-19, has been reprimanded for attempting to leave his assigned post without authorization.</p><p>Researcher ████, Site-19, has been reprimanded for failing to abide by proper security protocols and allowing unauthorized personnel to enter SCP-861’s containment area.</p><p>Researcher ███, Site-19, has been reprimanded for attempting to enter SCP-861’s containment area without permission.</p><p>Researcher [REDACTED] has been reprimanded for attempting to impede security procedures regarding the use of SCP-861.']</p>
