<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-597</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-597 is to be stored at Site ██ in a standard Safe-class containment locker. Any personnel with Level 4 clearance are permitted to view SCP-597 without the use of special clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-597 is a pocket flashlight of unknown brand and manufacture. SCP-597 weighs 0.25 kg and measures 8 by 3 cm. Upon removing the battery, no LEDs or other electrical components are present in the case. When an object is placed within SCP-597's beam, the object will disappear from its normal location and float at a distance of 1 meter above its original position.</p><p>SCP-597 was recovered from an abandoned military facility while investigating reports of anomalous phenomena connected with said facility. The reported anomalous activity ceased after Foundation agents infiltrated the facility and seized SCP-597.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum SCP-597-1:</strong> On ██/██/1984, SCP-597 was used by Dr. ████ to test the effects of SCP-1019 on the subject; however, he was killed during testing. SCP-597 was subsequently confiscated from his body and its contents were transferred to Site ██.']</p>
