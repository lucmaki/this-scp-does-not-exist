<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-808</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-808 is kept in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-18 with no fewer than two (2) guards present at all times. SCP-808's cell should be kept clean and well lit at all times, and any items or substances collected from the cell are to be thoroughly cataloged and stored in Site-18's chemical storage facility.</p><p>SCP-808 is to be provided with one regular meal daily, consisting of approximately 25 grams of propyl acetate, 5 grams of potassium nitrate, 10 grams of sulfuric acid, 10 grams of calcium oxide, 10 grams of platinum metal, 50 grams of hydrogen sulfide gas, and 20 grams of mercury metal. No more than one gram of any other substance is to be given to SCP-808; all materials given are to be weighed and recorded by on-site staff before being given to SCP-808. Only after passing this test can the subject be fed a second gram of different material.</p><p>SCP-808 has been shown to react violently when it believes its request for a second gram is not being met, using its prodigious strength to violently smash its head against the bars of its cell. Because of this, when food is delivered to SCP-808 it may refuse it by tearing off the bars instead and covering the food in bodily fluids before crushing it. It may also tear off portions of its bedding and use them as improvised weapons. This behavior has resulted in minor damage to the area and incineration of several items on occasion, but was deemed acceptable due to SCP-808's overall compliance with its containment procedures.</p><p>SCP-808 is allowed up to one hour outside its cell each day for exercise and recreation. Any attempts by SCP personnel to engage SCP-808 in conversation must be approved by at least two (2) senior staff members beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-808 is a human male, appearing in his early twenties. SCP-808 has a dense but not completely unkempt mane of hair and beard, and its body is covered with tattoos. When treated with a substance from the periodic table, SCP-808's tattoos glow brightly for approximately three (3) hours. These markings, which appear to be limited to a single paragraph surrounding one of the periodic symbols, are visible through SCP-808's clothing and occasionally rise up through its skin as 'worms' when removed (see Addendum).</p><p>SCP-808 displays extraordinary strength beyond that of any known human subject; even at rest it can bench press 1.5 times what an average human can lift. This strength seems to be related to the presence of sulfuric acid gases in its blood, having a direct correlation with the intensity of their glow; the higher their concentration is, the more power SCP-808 possesses.</p><p>In addition, SCP-808 was strongly resistant and durable against harmful substances such as acids and metals. Depending on how much sulfuric acid gas it has been exposed to previously, just one drop can cause serious injury or even death if contact is not avoided. This also causes severe pain to any subject who comes into contact with them.</p><p>When exposed to non-harmful elements (such as water) or non-living terrestrial lifeforms (such as a plant or animal), SCP-808's strength and invulnerability disappear; its tattoos simply glow with a blueish hue instead of glowing red. Although this change in appearance will make it less susceptible to physical attacks such as punches or stab wounds, it renders SCP-808 completely unable to resist these attacks apart from parrying them with its prodigious strength. SCP-808 had only shown signs of frustration at being unable to apply its full potential in these circumstances.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
