<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-973</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-973 is to be kept in a 5 m × 5 m cell at the Foundation Site-79. The cell must have a solid floor, with no air vents or holes for light. SCP-973 is allowed to wear her costume at all times, but may not leave its confines unless escorted by two Level 2 staff members. Said staff members are to escort SCP-973 to a bathroom and allow her to change into civilian clothing before leaving the containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-973 is a young white female, identified as █████ ████████. She measures 168 cm in height and weighs 76 kg. SCP-973 was initially discovered on the morning of 16/01/18██ in a shopping mall on ███████ Avenue, ██████.</p><p>SCP-973 has the ability to alter its appearance at will, changing into any normal human adult she can see. This ability seems to have an upper limit and cannot be used to change appearance beyond that limit. Current theorized limit is 10 m in height and 200 kg in weight. However, this ability does not seem to be related to SCP-973’s clothing or hair color, as she can transform into other human beings without her clothes or hair color changing.</p><p>The transformation process begins with SCP-973 preparing herself for the transformation by removing all of her clothing, including shoes and jewelry. Her outer clothing is replaced with a red dress and high heels, with a matching red wig and false eyelashes. After preparations are finished, SCP-973 will walk towards the person she intends to change into and then disappear from view of all observers except for the intended target. The transformation process takes approximately 3 seconds after which SCP-973 reappears where she disappeared originally and changes back into her original form before appearing within the target's field of vision.</p><p>SCP-973 is unable to communicate with any individuals who are not wearing her costume while transformed, or while in the immediate vicinity of the target. All attempts at communication have resulted in failure, including loud noise, personal appearances on television or radio or even simple verbal communication.</p><p>Transformation can only be reversed by using Class A amnestics; however it is not known if this only affects SCP-973's memory of being transformed or if it affects everyone else as well.</p><p>SCP-973 claims to be Princess ██████████, daughter of King ██████████ and Queen ██████████, who were murdered during a rebellion against King ██████████'s rule in 12██. She claims that she was brought up by a foster family until her eighteenth birthday when she was given back to her mother's family in exchange for her full cooperation with them (her exact words). She claims that her mother had been involved in the rebellion but was not directly killed. However, she knows no more about what happened to her father than any other individual would know about a character from a fairy tale.</p>
