<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-430</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-430 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment cell with no particular security measures. Protective barriers 3Â m from the front of the cell are to be monitored by on-site personnel daily during testing.</p><p>Personnel entering SCP-430's containment cell are required to report any change in its behavior to at least one (1) on-duty researcher before proceeding with the current test. Any personnel who has entered SCP-430's containment cell but do not report any changes in its behavior are to be suspended from duty for two days.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-430 is a steel briefcase with a red leather handle. SCP-430's anomalous effects manifest when it is brought into contact with an individual who suffers from suicidal ideation or shows no signs of mental health problems.</p><p>When SCP-430 is brought into contact with a suicidal individual, the individual will undergo unusual behavior and show signs of depression. For one to three days after its acquisition, the subject will stand at their designated station in the Foundation cafeteria and stare at nothing in particular, while they refuse to eat or drink anything. If the subject shows no signs of self-harm, they will remain in this state for as long as SCP-430 stays near them.</p><p>The first instance of SCP-430's effect manifested when a young male Foundation employee attempted to hang himself in his apartment. He was unresponsive to medical treatment for 72 hours, but did not attempt suicide again afterwards. After that instance, no additional attempts to commit suicide have been reported among employees working on the containment of SCP-430.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 430.1:</strong> Test Logs</p><p><strong>Test #:</strong> 430-C</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-957, female</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> D-957 was assigned to SCP-430's containment cell, and was instructed to report any changes in its behavior. No changes were observed in the first three hours of testing. After noon, D-957 was encouraged to eat by on-duty personnel. D-957 responded by eating six slices of pizza, one sandwich, and one bowl of cereal before returning to staring at nothing in particular.</p><p>D-957 was given a bottle of water and instructed to drink it; she refused.</p><p>D-957 was asked if she was feeling suicidal; she responded negatively.</p><p>D-957 was sent back to her assigned station in the cafeteria. She did not respond to greetings from Foundation employees or requests for information. No further actions were taken until SCP-430's anomalous effects ended.</p><p><strong>Test #:</strong> 430-B</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-767, male</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> D-767 was assigned to SCP-430's containment cell, and was instructed to report any changes in its behavior. No changes were observed in the first three hours of testing. D-767 was then taken to his designated station in the cafeteria, where he declined to eat anything offered to him by on-duty personnel.</p><p>D-767 was handed a glass of water. He drank it down quickly and returned to staring at nothing in particular.</p><p>D-767 was shown a picture of himself, along with a list of questions leading up to his suicide attempt; he did not respond to these questions or the picture.</p><p>D-767 was sent back to his assigned station in the cafeteria. He ate two slices of pizza before returning to staring at nothing in particular. No further actions were taken until SCP-430's anomalous effects ended."]</p>
