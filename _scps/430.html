<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-430</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-430 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment cell with no particular security measures. Protective barriers 3 m from the front of the cell are to be monitored by on-site personnel daily during testing.</p><p>Personnel entering SCP-430's containment cell are required to report any change in its behavior to at least one (1) on-duty researcher before proceeding with the current test. Any personnel who has entered SCP-430's containment cell but do not report any changes in its behavior are to be suspended from duty for two days.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-430 is a steel briefcase with a red leather handle. SCP-430's anomalous effects manifest when it is brought into contact with an individual who suffers from suicidal ideation or shows no signs of mental health problems.</p><p>When SCP-430 is brought into contact with a suicidal individual, the individual will undergo unusual behavior and show signs of depression. For one to three days after its acquisition, the subject will stand at their designated station in the Foundation cafeteria and stare at nothing in particular, while they refuse to eat or drink anything. If the subject shows no signs of self-harm, they will remain in this state for as long as SCP-430 stays near them.</p><p>The first instance of SCP-430's effect manifested when a young male Foundation employee attempted to hang himself in his apartment. He was unresponsive to medical treatment for 72 hours, but did not attempt suicide again afterwards. After that instance, no additional attempts to commit suicide have been reported among employees working on the containment of SCP-430.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
