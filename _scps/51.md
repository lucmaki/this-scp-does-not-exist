<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-51</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A small bush has been planted in the path leading to SCP-51's home. As a precaution, personnel assigned to SCP-51's containment must take note of any cars or other moving objects on the roadways and must be equipped with a pair of sunglasses with an opaque coating in order to avoid direct contact with SCP-51's anomalous effects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-51 is a humanoid being resembling a child with black hair. After two and a half years of not being observed or photographed, SCP-51 has the appearance of a girl of roughly 16 years old. However, SCP-51 cannot be interacted with directly; this effect is limited to persons who are not wearing sunglasses at the time of contact.</p><p>SCP-51's anomalous property manifests when any person who is not wearing sunglasses directs their gaze at SCP-51 at a distance greater than 6 meters (a force of around 10 g being used). This will cause the viewer to experience complete blindness for five seconds. It takes three minutes for the blindness to wear off, but it can be prevented by immediately covering both eyes with sunglasses. The subject will suffer from partial blindness for about 30 seconds after removal of their sunglasses, though their vision can still be blocked by their hair, which grows out from their back rather than from any organ in their head.</p><p>When the subjects lose vision due to SCP-51, they will begin to suffer from hunger due to increased appetite. They experience extreme discomfort within this state, with many complaining that "it's as if [their] head is under water", and some claiming to be "suffocating" or "having an asthma attack".</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 1:</strong> SCP-51 was recovered from a warehouse located in ████████, ██████, on █/█/218. The warehouse was owned by the [REDACTED] family, who had been reported missing as of [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>SCP-51 had been locked in a room located within the warehouse, and a note was found attached to its door. The note read:</p><p>Don't look at me!</p><p>I don't want to see your ugly face!</p><p>It makes me so mad!</p><p>Please move out!</p><p>I need my space!"]</p>
