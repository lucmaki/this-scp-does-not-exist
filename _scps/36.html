<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-36</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The interior of SCP-36 is to be constructed from 2m lengths of chain link fence, 1.5m in height, with no openings larger than 20 mm. A diving bell is to be constructed of a similar size and placed over the entrance. The location of the underwater entrance to SCP-36 is to be secured to prevent unauthorized access. A secondary lockbox, located at Site-46, is to be used in conjunction with the main lockbox located within SCP-36.</p><p>Since SCP-36's discovery, multiple containment breaches have occurred due to the nature of SCP-36's anomalous effects. Due to these breaches, level 3 personnel are permitted to access SCP-36 despite being discouraged from doing so by Level 2 staff members. No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-36 except for D-Class personnel undergoing testing and demonstration. Containment of SCP-36 is ongoing, and all efforts should focus on securing each and every breach.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-36 is a cave located in the south of ██████, North Carolina. SCP-36 initially appeared to be an empty void out of which spread two tracks of human footprints. No signs of life or signs of origin have been found anywhere within the cave, or outside the cave.</p><p>SCP-36 appears to be hollow, and every surface inside the cave is coated in ice that is at least one millimeter thick. A small lake lies within SCP-36, and has been frozen solid for approximately twenty years. The temperature inside SCP-36 does not seem to vary from standard freezing temperatures. Any water passing through SCP-36 will freeze immediately, making it essentially impossible to escape by any means of exit not created by SCP-36 itself.</p><p>SCP-36 is home to at least twelve individuals with no known origin, referred to as the "Euclid". On 3/2/2014, researcher ████████ leaked the information on SCP-36 to several media outlets prior to his termination, which was decided by higher command after reviewing ██████████'s logbook on site. The information leak caused a significant rise in public attention towards SCP-36, which resulted in an increase in number of tourists visiting SCP-36 each year despite its "here for a visit" status. Additionally, several containment breach notices have been issued due to increase in unwanted visitors - these visitors have had their eyes removed and replaced with thermoses filled with coffee beans meant for exploration teams serving as scientific assistants on explorations inside SCP-36.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
