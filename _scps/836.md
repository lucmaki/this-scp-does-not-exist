<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-836</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-836 is to be kept in a standard containment locker located at Site-19. No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-836 enclosures unless accompanied by Level 2 security personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-836 is a bamboo curtain measuring approximately 5.28 m × 4.4 m. Testing has shown that SCP-836 does not change size, and will remain at an average of 5.28 m × 4.4 m indefinitely unless measured or physically altered in any way.</p><p>When observed through a video camera, SCP-836 appears to be ordinary bamboo, with strands of light yellow coloration. The interior and exterior surfaces are perfectly smooth and appear to be made entirely of paper, most likely rice paper. Nevertheless, it is impermeable to moisture once installed and will not deteriorate even through prolonged exposure to water, humidity and rain. If the exterior surface is damaged, the interior will reform itself instantaneously and remain impermeable after partial damage.</p><p>SCP-836 was recovered from ███████████████, Japan on 8/18/20██ after reports indicated that the town had been covered by an impenetrable yellow "curtains" for 1 month prior to Foundation intervention. At this time, the material appearing to be made of paper was identified as bamboo by Japanese civilians and Foundation personnel who were dispatched to investigate the situation, though it was treated as an anomalous object for containment purposes until further investigation could take place.</p><p>Investigation into the origin of SCP-836 is ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 836-1:</strong> Description of Test SCP-836</p><p>The following is a transcript of the first recorded test of SCP-836.</p><p><Begin Log, 9/1/20██, 10:30 AM></p><p>[Dr. ██████ speaks to the camera.]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> All right, let's try this out.</p><p>[Dr. ██████ moves SCP-836 to stand in front of the camera for a few seconds.]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> It's not working. SCP-836 has to be larger than the camera.</p><p>[Dr. ██████ glances at the camera and then speaks to the camera again.]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Hold it up a little higher.</p><p>[Dr. ██████ stands behind SCP-836 and tosses a small utility belt with a measuring tape attached to it towards the end of it.]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> There you go, now measure it again.</p><p>[The camera catches the object on its way down.]</p><p>[The same object rolls down the length of SCP-836 and disappears out of view.]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Uh oh… I think that got stuck in there somehow… Well, I guess we'll have to open it up and see what we can find inside, right?</p><p>[Dr. ██████ picks up a large knife and starts to unsheathe it.]</p><p>[At this time, the object is revealed in a close-up view of SCP-836's interior. The area inside appears to be filled with yellowish chrysanthemums, with approximately 15% of them being dead.]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Oh no… What is that? What do you want us to do with flowers? How is this even possible?</p><p>[A 3 second pause passes before an unidentified male voice is heard.]</p><p><strong>Unidentified Male Voice:</strong> Hey, man! We're sorry about the curtain! You know how hard it is to keep things from getting out… We'll clean it up now! Thanks for your patience! (giggle)</p><p>[The object is then seen being removed from SCP-836 by several civilians carrying buckets.]</p><p>[After 5 minutes have passed, Dr. ██████ speaks to the camera again.]</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> We should call in more manpower as soon as we can, just in case this continues to happen. If this happens again, I don't even know what to say… This was supposed to be just a test after all."]</p>
