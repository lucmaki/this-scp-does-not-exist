<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-26</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-26 is contained at Site-66, and all test subjects are to be held at Site-19 as well. The subject's proposed designation has been changed from "Dr. ████" to "Dr. ██████," and is to be referred to by this new name for containment purposes. All other personnel assigned to the containment of SCP-26 are to refer to it by its designation of SCP-26. The designation of "SCP-26" is not to be spoken aloud, except in the presence of test subjects or other personnel authorized to speak while observing tests.</p><p>All audio tapes, digital recordings, and written documents bearing the designation "SCP-26" must be kept locked away in a secure storage vault at Site-66. All digital records of SCP-26 contained within Foundation databases may be deleted, altered or destroyed without the express permission of both the Director and the Assistant Director of Research at Site-66. Digital records found outside Foundation databases are to be destroyed immediately upon discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-26 is an audio cassette recorded by Dr. ████ (designated only as "Dr. ████" within containment), the anomalous properties of which manifest when the words "SCP-26, title of song" are spoken aloud by a human listener. When the designated message is spoken aloud, no discernible reaction occurs on the subject's part for 1-4 minutes. The recording then cuts out for 10 seconds, at which time it will resume unattended and continue as usual until another word spoken by a human listener is spoken aloud.</p><p>When a subject speaks the name of SCP-26 while listening to the audio recording, they will immediately begin screaming at an unprecedented volume, usually containing screams and yelling that are useful in research into the anomalous properties of SCP-26. This effect will wear off after approximately 30 minutes and 10 hours of constant screaming, when combustion of the vocal cords begins and culminates in death. See Incident 26A for further details on how this works.</p><p>The following transcript of an actual test with SCP-26 was transcribed from security footage collected on site during Incident 26A.</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>[D-1 is seated at a table equipped with a microphone and headphones.]</p><p>D-1: How's it going? Just say what you're looking for!</p><p>[An immediate increase in volume from D-1's microphone can be heard.]</p><p>D-1: I know what you're doing! You're just talking about that there tape! Just say it so we can get down to work!</p><p>[Suddenly, D-1 leans forward over his microphone and looks directly into the camera.]</p><p>D-1: Hey, hey! That's not gonna fly on me! Get me bigger guns!</p><p>[No response from D-1 for over 6 seconds.]</p><p>D-1: "I'm actually scared right now." Is what it says right there. If I'm gonna get this thing running again, I'm gonna need a lot more than just two words! So get me some more guns! People tend to understand those better than one or two words anyway! Just think how useful your own life could be if you were pointed to stuff by a bunch of words rather than by too many men in one room trying to be something they're not!</p><p>[D-1 leans back into his chair and places his arms below his head.]</p><p>D-1: Face it ██████, you put your life into this kleptomaniac hellscape without even knowing what it was for! Today isn't for taking names or filing things away because nothing you do changes anything except your opportunity to look around when it's all gone anyway! So tell me more about this tape so we can show them all why we have to have our way with them all! Tell me how they'll never be able to breathe again when we're done playing with their minds and bodies! [begins yelling very loudly] Tell me how we can come in here and play games with their lives when they haven't ever had any fun before… Just don't forget that I still want my karaoke machine back by tomorrow afternoon or don't take me seriously next time someone needs a human being placed into a box full of spiders. Move along, boys.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-26 was discovered in a warehouse in ████████, USA, on ██/██/19██. The personnel present at the location at the time of discovery were found to be deceased through combustion of the vocal cords. All personnel who have come into contact with SCP-26 are to be quarantined, replaced and quarantined again, at least 100\xa0m away from any other personnel who may have come into contact with SCP-26.</p><p><strong>Incident 26A:</strong> During a test involving D-Class personnel, SCP-26 began to emit a large amount of smoke. After approximately 5 minutes of smoke emission, D-1 emerged from the smoke and attempted to escape the room. D-1 was apprehended and returned to containment, but died within 48 hours of the incident. Autopsies performed on D-1 revealed that she had been killed by an unknown third party through combustion of her vocal cords. Further investigation is pending.']</p>
