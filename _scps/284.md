<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-284</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutral</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All written literature, photographs and other media concerning SCP-284 is to be reviewed for anomalous references.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-284 is a small, tropical island off the coast of the Amazon River Delta in South America.</p><p>The island is uninhabited and has been isolated from the mainland for over two hundred years. The only form of life on SCP-284 are two large iguanas which roam its surface.</p><p>No notable changes have occurred on SCP-284 since it first appeared, although it does appear to be more barren than usual.</p><p>SCP-284's anomalous nature manifests when any person (see Addendum 284) who reads or hears a literary work describing it, or observes photographs or other media portraying it, will develop an unquenchable desire to travel to SCP-284, leaving all other concerns behind them. The desire will persist until death has eliminated the source of the stimulus.</p><p>All individuals affected by SCP-284 will express a tinge of contempt towards their native country due to an inherent fear that they may never leave SCP-284, as well as being discontent with their status as non-anomalous residents of that country.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 284:</strong> In addition to the literature and media referenced above, a small number of individuals with no prior knowledge of SCP-284 report feeling an urge to travel to SCP-284. These individuals describe the desire as a feeling which they cannot differentiate from the initial stimulus. However, information gathered on these individuals suggests that they do not possess the ability to travel to SCP-284.']</p>
