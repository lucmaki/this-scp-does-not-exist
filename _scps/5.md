<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> 3 km area surrounding the SCP-5 anomaly is to be fenced off and patrolled by Site-23 personnel on duty at X███. Any civilians who enter the area are to be detained, administered Amnestics, and released at Site-23's discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5 is an area of 3 km radius centered around SCP-5's location, which contains no trees at all. Any objects that remain inside the area are ejected from it after approximately 12 hours. Objects ejected from SCP-5 do not continue moving in a straight path, but instead proceed to fall at a rate of approximately 10 meters per minute toward Earth.</p><p>SCP-5 was discovered on X███, when the Foundation learned of an incident involving a US government facility and the murder of a US soldier who had been assigned there for training purposes. After an investigation, SCP-5 was identified as the cause of the phenomenon. The area was secured by cleanup teams, and further investigation revealed that the anomaly had been present since 1970, with no known cause or explanation as to how it appeared or how it disappeared.</p><p>Despite this, several incidents in 1999 strongly suggested that SCP-5 was alive, although no witnesses were able to confirm such reports due to being inside SCP-5 while they took place. In addition, several similar artifacts were discovered in various locations around northern Europe during this time, but these were dismissed as hoaxes until Site-23 personnel confirmed their existence and the anomalous effects they produced themselves.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum SCP-5:</strong> On ██/██/2001, SCP-5 was released by SCP-5-B. SCP-5-B is a large tree located outside of the area of effect of SCP-5. When SCP-5 is expelled from it, it does not continue falling, but instead moves in a straight path towards Earth at a rate of 1\xa0km per hour.']</p>
