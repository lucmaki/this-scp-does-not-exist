<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-81</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-81 is to be confounded by any means possible, in an effort to prevent its return. Its co-location at the intersection of Union and Western avenues should be monitored at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-81 is a large limestone obelisk located in the middle of Union and Western avenues. The text "Memorial, alma mater" is carved into the front of its base.</p><p>In 790BC, SCP-81 served as a memorial to SCP-81's founder after he died while trying to reach the summit of Mount ██████. After his death, SCP-81 was recovered by archaeological workers and moved to oncoming traffic with the express purpose of preventing others from making the same mistake. As a precursor to this, a large rock was placed underneath it to prevent it from ascending above street level.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 81-1:</strong> SCP-81 was recovered from the side of its designated location, and was determined to be an instance of SCP-████. A Foundation investigation into the previous owner of SCP-81 led to the discovery of several other anomalies in their home. All were subsequently contained by Mobile Task Force Theta-9. After further investigation, it was discovered that all instances of SCP-████ were created by one person prior to their containment, and that this individual had been killed in 1978.</p>
