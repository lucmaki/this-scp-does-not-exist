<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-411</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The goal of SCP-411 is to create a positive, long-term effect on the behavior of animal life on Earth. All animals that meet the criteria listed below have been designated as part of SCP-411.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-411 is comprised of animals that display empathy for other animals or humans. This empathy causes them to avoid unnecessary deaths, even if it means it causes their own death. Currently listed are:</p><p>As of May 13th, 2017, the classification is still pending.</p><p>The animals eligible for SCP-411 designation were chosen because they demonstrated the ability to act in a nonhumanistic way, but their actions had no known effect on their own survival.</p><p>Upon designation as part of SCP-411, each subject is given extensive psychological counseling and meditation therapy and are monitored by researchers 24 hours a day. All subjects listed above are housed at Site 77. Any animal capable of being part of SCP-411 is a potential candidate for the program.</p><p>Animal testing within SCP-411 has been suspended; however, further testing approved by Site 77's Senior Staff Protocol Committee is still possible.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 411-01:</strong> Addendum 411-01 is a list of criteria for an animal to be part of SCP-411. These animals must meet ALL of the criteria listed below.</p><p>The animal must not possess inborn or innate tendencies towards empathy.</p><p>The animal must not be aware of its own death.</p><p>The animal must have a high level of intelligence.</p><p>The animal's actions must not have any effect on its own survival."]</p>
