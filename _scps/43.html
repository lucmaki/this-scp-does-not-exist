<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-43</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-43 are to be kept in a standard containment locker. No personnel other than research staff and other level 3 or higher security personnel are to be allowed within SCP-43's containment chamber without prior approval. SCP-43 are to be fed once every three days via the lid of their containment locker. All research staff members who run experiments involving SCP-43 must complete a physical examination before, during and after the experiment. Any personnel who become ill from research involving SCP-43 must report to their supervisor immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-43 is a collection of seventeen (17) red sparrows, of German and Finnish origin. SCP-43's anomalous properties are manifested through its containment.</p><p>SCP-43 will normally display behavior typical of adult German or Finnish red squirrels. This behavior will occasionally include the sparrows feeding on small food items or seeds. Should a sparrow become physically sick, it will continue to feed until it becomes healthy again. When SCP-43 is hungry, it will attempt to feed itself. If SCP-43 does not have sufficient food for all of its members, it will split its food evenly among all members of SCP-43 - even if this means not enough food for every member at all times.</p><p>Should any member of SCP-43 die, all other members of SCP-43 will bury the deceased member in a shallow grave in their enclosure. The burial will include some dried grass, dirt and leaves with an empty nest in the shape of a paw print into which they place small pieces of wood. If more than one member of the flock dies at once, all members of SCP-43 will bury their dead in shifts to minimize the amount of time spent digging graves. Any attempt by other birds or animals to dig into a SCP-43 funeral will result in the offending animal becoming ill and bleeding from the beak or eyes.</p><p>All 17 instances of SCP-43 share a single group mind capable of holding simple or complex conversations with each other and understanding speech spoken by humans under normal conditions. Through an unknown mechanism all instances of SCP-43 are able to understand languages they have never before been exposed to, including human speech as well as nonverbal cues such as gestures, body language and tone of voice. These languages include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 43-1:</strong> SCP-43 was discovered after the Foundation received a complaint from a local wildlife park in ██████████, Michigan. The owner of the wildlife park reported that SCP-43 had been harassing his staff and other animals. After the owner sent personnel to investigate, all 17 instances of SCP-43 were found to be dead. The bodies were placed in individual graves and surrounded by dried grass and leaves. Each grave also contained a paw print made from wood with the body inside, an empty nest and a piece of grass with a small twig protruding from it. The bodies were buried in shifts so that the 17 instances could continue to feed themselves.']</p>
