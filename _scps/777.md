<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-777</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-777 is to be kept in a waterproof safe box, in the Safe Containment Wing of Site ██. Personnel are not to touch SCP-777 without permission from a Level 4 researcher. Level 3 and 4 staff should be assigned to check on SCP-777 at least once every five months.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-777 is a 24th century EOS camera model. It has completely original circuitry, and no other anomalous properties have been observed since initial acquisition. SCP-777 was found in the home of Dr. ██████ ███████████ at ██████, Minnesota, and appears to have been manufactured around the year ██-██-███.</p><p>The film in SCP-777 can be developed by any standard darkroom method. Upon developing, subjects will find a photograph of themselves in place of an object or scene depicted in the picture. This effect does not occur when SCP-777 is rewound or replayed on video, as it is considered impossible for SCP-777 to behave differently due to its complete internal design. The photo will coincide with whatever location is being portrayed by the camera at that moment; this is the only known way to photograph oneself with SCP-777.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum SCP-777-1:</strong> On ██/██/20██, a photograph of Dr. ██████ ███████████ was found on the film in SCP-777, located in his office. The photograph appears to show Dr. ███████████ confronting two female humanoid figures, who appeared to be wearing pajamas and speaking to each other.']</p>
