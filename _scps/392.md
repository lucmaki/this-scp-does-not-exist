<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-392</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All records of SCP-392 are to be destroyed. Any site containing research into SCP-392 is to be quarantined and the affected personnel administered Class A amnestics. The elderly members of Foundation staff have been granted indefinite leave of absence.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-392 was a proprietary chemical cleaning solution produced by the ████ █████ Company. SCP-392 is strongly acidic, with a pH of 1, and is an effective cleaner for most household items. When exposed to air, SCP-392 will form a water soluble foam. This foam is highly corrosive upon contact with skin or hair, causing temporary alopecia and dry brittle hair growth as well as constant pain and irritation.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-392 was discovered in ████████, Texas in August of ████. Foundation agents were dispatched to the city to investigate any evidence of SCP-392 use. The Foundation's agents discovered a local factory producing SCP-392, and began investigating the chemical's origins.</p><p>After one month, a phone call was made to the ██████ █████ Company by an employee who claimed to be an SCP-392 test subject. After questioning, the employee stated that the company was aware of the test but had no knowledge of SCP-392's corrosive properties. The employee was then terminated.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that the ███████ █████ Company had been dissolved by a local bankruptcy court on July 27th, ████. The court order also contained a clause preventing any part of the liquid from being sold for profit for an indefinite period of time. This clause was signed by the former CEO and president of the company.</p><p>On August 3rd, Agent ██████ was dispatched to retrieve any liquid samples contained in the factory's storage area. As he reached the third floor, Agent ██████ heard a loud snap coming from behind him. Instead of turning around, Agent ██████ slowly continued towards his destination before stopping and opening his briefcase. Inside were several small sticks of what appeared to be chalk or pasty substance. Upon closer inspection, Agent ██████ noted that the substance had a strong smell reminiscent of SCP-392, but was slightly more acidic than SCP-392 itself. Agent ██████ reported that it took him over an hour to begin removing each individual piece of this substance from his suit without sustaining any further damage."]</p>
