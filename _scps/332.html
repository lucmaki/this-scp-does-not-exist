<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-332</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Minor</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-332 is contained at Site 49 in a 5m x 10m x 10m enclosure consisting of reinforced concrete, mahogany, and steel. SCP-332's containment chamber is to be kept at 20 degrees Celsius with a humidity level of no less than 80%. During experimentation, a 1mm layer of lead is to be applied to the walls of SCP-332's containment chamber. The humidity level has been lowered from 80% to 70% to prevent SCP-332 from creating additional deposits of water. Maintenance must be done regularly on this layer to prevent it from wearing off and exposing SCP-332's inner structure to the elements.</p><p>SCP-332 is placed in its containment chamber every month for 10 hours where it will be bathed and fed. During experiments with live subjects, no more than one subject is allowed in the same location as SCP-332 at once to prevent potential effects on the surrounding area.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-332's design and physical composition have been variously described as a geometric pattern, an abstracted representation of the tessellated interior of an atom, or a fractal rendering of the atomic lattice. SCP-332 is a non-anomalous piece of volcanic basalt created at ██ BC.</p><p>SCP-332 contains a complex structure not immediately visible to the naked eye. Upon close inspection with a magnifying glass or through x-ray vision, the structure is revealed to consist of an infinite series of interlocking crystals resembling sharp needles. The majority of SCP-332 is composed of metallic prisms, but 104 cubic meters of its interior are composed entirely of water. A drop of water has been shown to be able to penetrate through SCP-332's shell and into its inner contents without breaking apart, though it is unknown how this effect can be achieved without physical damage to SCP-332.</p><p>The interior of SCP-332 flooded with water has been shown to have several effects on external objects. First, any solid object placed inside SCP-332 (including human subjects) will undergo a complete liquidification process over the course of 1 minute and 30 seconds. This event is exclusively observed in instances where the subject is submerged below 1 meter in volume. The remnants of these subjects will then rise again, liquefying as they do so until they reach the surface. Subjects that are submerged below 50% volume are not observed to undergo this liquid phase of their process; however, they appear fully liquid regardless.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-332 was contained at Site 49 after it was initially thought to be a simple geothermal vent, and was then classified as a Euclid-class anomaly. After further experimentation, the Foundation determined that SCP-332 is non-anomalous and has no anomalous properties.</p><p><strong>Experiment Log 332-1:</strong> Subject 1: D-00858, male, 19 years old</p><p><strong>Subject 2:</strong> D-00859, male, 19 years old</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject 1 is submerged in SCP-332 using a hose with a diameter of 3.5\xa0cm. Subject 2 is submerged in an identical manner. After 15 minutes of immersion, subject 1 and subject 2 are brought back to the surface of SCP-332.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject 1 is found to be completely liquid while subject 2 is still solid. Subject 1 liquifies over the course of 15 minutes while subject 2 takes slightly longer to liquify to the same degree. After 24 hours, both subjects are found to have liquified fully into water vapor.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All subjects were submerged in water for only 15 minutes at a time.</p>
