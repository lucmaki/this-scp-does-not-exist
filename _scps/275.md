<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-275</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The remaining portions of SCP-275 are to be stored in a secure containment locker at Site-66, accessed only by Level 3 personnel. Personnel must be issued clearance through the Site-66 administration office and also rated as Dopplegangers to access the locker. The locker is to be kept in a standard security locker room with no access to the outside. A combination lock may be used when access is required, and should remain unchanged between uses.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-275 designates the remains of Hector de Frutos, J.D., of the 23rd Marine Regiment, 2nd Division in Cuba.</p><p>SCP-275 is a Scrapbook of photographs, newspaper clippings and other miscellaneous items collected by De Frutos (henceforth referred to as SCP-275-1). When viewed outside of the anomaly, it appears to be several pieces of papers taped together with photos glued inside. The pages are made from various papers from different sources.</p><p>When viewing an item within the anomaly, it will appear similar to when viewed outside, but with minor alterations. The SCP-275 has proven capable of altering photographs quite well, and has been known to photograph things that have never been photographed before. The item itself is not altered when viewed within the anomaly; however, the information contained within is altered into a more believable scenario. This includes the picture's history being forgotten and no further evidence remaining about it.</p><p>Items that are 'Forever Forgotten' and located in at least one country will be displayed at their correct date and location. Items that are 'Possibly Forgotten' or 'Maybe Forgotten' can only be displayed during a time period in which they were either very well remembered or not at all remembered. For example, if a photo was forgotten after 1899, then all variants will show 1899's date, regardless of the original year it was taken for comparison purposes.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On August 26th, 1952, SCP-275 was brought to the attention of the Foundation by Agent ████████. Upon investigation, the item was discovered in ███████, Mexico. The following is a translated excerpt from Agent ████████'s report.</p><p>When we first arrived at the site, we discovered a man who claimed to have found the object. When he was questioned about his discovery, he stated that it was his uncle who had found it in 1949, and that they had been searching for it ever since. He also mentioned that there are many items hidden within the house, but remembered nothing else. I relayed this information to Agent ████████, who then notified me that we were going to need a much more thorough search than we had originally expected.</p><p>After searching for several hours, we discovered a short list of items that were not listed in the original report from Mexico. These items were:</p><p><BEGIN TRANSCRIPTION></p><p>Item #1 – A small portrait of Jesus Christ</p><p>Item #2 – A copy of The New York Times dated June 30th, 1879</p><p>Item #3 – A small carved wooden crucifix</p><p>Item #4 – A small notebook containing an unknown language</p><p>Item #5 – A small stack of photographs of De Frutos with his wife and child</p><p><END TRANSCRIPTION></p><p>The journal and photos were later found to be written in Spanish, which is not known in Mexico during this time period. The crucifix is currently unknown. The only known photograph is a self-portrait of De Frutos as an older adult. Agent ████████ is currently attempting to discover what happened to De Frutos's family or other Spanish speaking individuals during this time period and why they were in Mexico."]</p>
