<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-910</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-910 is contained at Site-22, the only known location where SCP-910 poses no threat. However, it is kept within a standard containment cell that is to be checked for the presence of SCP-910 each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. While SCP-910 cannot affect those on site, any D-Class personnel who have previously encountered SCP-910 are to remain within site grounds for the duration of their stay at Site-22 until it has been determined that they do not retain any evidence of SCP-910.</p><p>Any object bearing symbols from SCP-910 must be contained in designated containment chambers until such time as further investigation is complete. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to open such objects may be executed outside of site grounds in the event of breach of containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-910 is a type of boot that was originally manufactured by ████████ in the late 19th century. SCP-910 appears to be leather, but it congeals into a sticky, gelatinous substance when worn.</p><p>While wearing SCP-910, those affected will have acute difficulties in walking, often placing their foot incorrectly or attempting to move with excessive force. Once the wearer has attempted to walk ten times in a row and failed to do so, they must attempt to accomplish this task within one hour using any effort necessary. If the subject does not take measures to walk for this period, they may die as a result of heart failure, malnutrition or infection if they are not provided with adequate care.</p><p>It is unknown how long this effect can persist before an individual has ceased moving due to SCP-910's effects; though it usually lasts no longer than two hours. It is unknown why movement of the afflicted appears to be curtailed rather than nonexistent, though certain hypotheses have been brought up by Dr. Englemann:</p><p>Circumstances leading up to retrieval: During initial investigation into possible instances of SCP-910 at ████████'s factory in 1874, the first piece of clothing discovered contained a misprinted symbol for the number nine (the suggested logo for the company) on one sleeve.</p>
