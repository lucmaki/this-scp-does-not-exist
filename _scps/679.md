<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-679</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As legal appeals can be filed against any ruling rendered by the SCP-679, it is currently forbidden to issue bail or post bail for any individual accused of crimes related to SCP-679.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-679 is a phenomenon in which one or more individuals, referred to as SCP-679-1, will be found on the ground unconscious or dead near the site of a previously scheduled execution. The name and date of the scheduled execution are noted with an accompanying letter "X". The condition of the individual(s) found varies; as long as they are not alive and/or conscious, SCP-679-1 will appear near death. Despite this, SCP-679-1 has no normal increase in mortality from nonanomalous causes, and does not appear to exhibit any particular medical issues due to their proximity to death.</p><p>Upon closer examination of the corpse, it is discovered that SCP-679-1 possesses characteristics similar to those possessed by a person (SCP-679-2) scheduled for execution. This execution previously took place shortly before their death and was carried out by one of several SCP Foundation personnel trained in lethal methods (designated SCP-679-3). SCP-679 appears infrequently, usually only once every ██ years.</p><p>When an individual who has been scheduled for execution is found near SCP-679, they will not be able to recall any memories prior to their transition into an instance of SCP-679. Attempting either through questioning or memory editing will result in them describing traveling at different speeds or even traveling back in time. Further testing revealed that if the individual was scheduled for death but was not executed before the transition into an instance of SCP-679 then test results will show events occurring differently from how they were originally intended. Further testing revealed that if the trial proceedings were still ongoing when the subject passed from their original state into an instance of SCP-679 then test results will show events taking place after their death. It is therefore hypothesized that an event which occurred before their transition into an instance of SCP-679 may be somehow influencing that transition.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-679 was discovered on 11/12/19██, when an individual (SCP-679-1) was found unconscious near the site of a scheduled execution. The individual had been scheduled for death by electrocution (designated SCP-679-4), but was found unconscious in a configuration similar to that of an instance of SCP-679-2.']</p>
