<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-167</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-167 is to be kept in a containment locker at Site-19. No electronic devices are to be allowed within 10 cm of the containment area. Personnel entering the testing chamber should keep their phones completely powered off and placed in a sealed metal container at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-167 is a shaped like a large silver question mark, with numerous round holes on the surface. It can be up to 7 cm in diameter and 12 cm long, with a depth of 4 to 6 cm. The object has no base or handle. Once SCP-167 is placed on an electronic device, it will begin to affect the device by electronically stimulating all functions as if they were being performed by the human brain. This process begins as soon as 20 minutes after SCP-167 comes into contact with the device and continues until it has been removed from the device.</p><p>Once SCP-167 has affected one electronic device, it will move randomly around the facility until it causes another electronic device to malfunction. When two devices are affected at the same time, they may interact in a manner dependent on their positions and their general design. For example, if a sound playing device is within 10 cm of both devices simultaneously, when discovered playing music will cause them both to malfunction as well as becoming louder than before and possibly altering the behavior of other devices in their path. This phenomenon will continue until more devices have been affected by SCP-167 or it itself is removed from the facility; however, in rare cases this effect can be limited by proximity to an intelligent subject. If a group therapy session is scheduled with Foundation personnel, each individual that enters the testing chamber must be accompanied by another subject of their choosing who does not exhibit any anomalies themselves.</p><p>If an object has been affected by SCP-167 for more than ten hours consecutively, it will begin malfunctioning more frequently, sometimes even causing its own destruction. During these times subjects of SCP-167's current affect will become agitated and violent towards other subjects using improvised weapons such as chairs and stones while attempting to remove them from their bodies. Subjects may also engage in cannibalism due to hunger and boredom when this occurs.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 167-1:</strong> On 12/12/1999, the following message was discovered written on the floor of a testing chamber. It is currently unknown if it was written by SCP-167 or a subject using it.</p><p>What’s the point of life if we can’t laugh?</p><p>The point of life is to laugh and have fun!</p><p>I’m sorry I don’t know what to do with all this energy…</p>
