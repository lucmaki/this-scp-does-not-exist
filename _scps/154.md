<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-154</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-154 is contained at Site-77. A specialized containment vehicle has been constructed for the transfer of SCP-154 and must be used exclusively for transporting SCP-154. The vehicle should be equipped with several steel plates to prevent breaching, and a small surveillance camera mounted on the roof to monitor the interior of the vehicle.</p><p>The vehicle will be kept under constant surveillance inside and outside the facility at all times to prevent unauthorized access. All personnel not assigned to SCP-154 transport will be kept in a nearby building monitored after hours by security personnel. Only Class D personnel are permitted to handle SCP-154.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-154 is a suburban American house, located in [REDACTED]. It has been determined through experimentation that while SCP-154 is contained at Site-77, the area surrounding it remains relatively unaffected by SCP-154. Of note: trees near the house remain untouched, despite the branches being completely stripped of leaves and wood.</p><p>SCP-154 is currently under investigation for possible properties inconsistent with its current classification. Foundation personnel are not permitted to investigate any other properties of SCP-154.</p><p>SCP-154 was originally brought to the Foundation's attention when autopsy reports for several individuals were found to be identical, with only a small variation in the dates of death. Investigation found that these individuals had died during a single night in [REDACTED]. The bodies were destroyed after they had expired, but investigators discovered that the victims had been stripped down to their undergarments before death. This led to an investigation into SCP-154's properties.</p>
