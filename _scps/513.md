<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-513</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-513 is held in a standard Foundation high-security isolation cell. The cell is to be kept at a temperature of 20°C, the humidity at 50%, and the air pressure at 101kPa. No other personnel are to enter SCP-513's room without express permission from a Level 3 researcher. To prevent any further incidents involving SCP-513, all staff associated with SCP-513 are to be rotated on a six month basis, with at least two weeks of no interaction between personnel.</p><p>All queries regarding SCP-513 should be made in writing via the Foundation front company "Pelican Point Group" (or PPG). Under no circumstances are any personnel to contact SCP-513 directly, or discuss its anomalous properties with any third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-513 is a mannequin, approximately 2.6m in height and possessing an 18 cm x 20 cm x 22 cm head. SCP-513 is composed entirely of white rubber, with several industrial style wheels or dollies mounted on the back, left leg and right wrist.</p><p>When approached by a human subject, who is able to see the reflection of SCP-513, no anomalous properties are triggered until SCP-513 is shut off, or in extreme cases when it has been completely disassembled and shipped to another room. SCP-513 freezes if its movement capabilities are restricted, however if it is turned off at this point it will begin to move according to preprogrammed instructions within 3 minutes. It will be fully functional again after an hour.</p><p>SCP-513 appears to have no concept for self preservation unless instructed otherwise via written code. If a subject attempts to flee from SCP-513's presence, or attempt to harm any part of it, they will find themselves unable to escape without the use of offensive measures against themselves or others. Although most victims have described themselves as feeling terrified or on edge during this time, all have reported feelings of euphoria while trapped by SCP-513's anomalous properties.</p><p>It is unknown what triggers SCP-513's anomalous effect; however all attempts to disable it have failed thus far. An investigation into alternative forms of containment is due in 2021</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-513 was originally contained in a luxury home, owned by ███ ███████ and his family. The house was purchased by the Foundation after several anomalous events involving SCP-513 occurred, which included ███ ███████\'s wife reporting an encounter with SCP-513.</p><p>Following this incident, SCP-513 was moved to its current containment cell, and all staff were rotated out of their positions within three days.</p><p>SCP-513\'s anomalous properties were first discovered when ██-year-old █████ ███████ had a severe seizure while reading a magazine. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Following this event, SCP-513 was immediately taken into Foundation custody by Mobile Task Force Pi-3 ("Pointman") and transferred to its present containment facility.']</p>
