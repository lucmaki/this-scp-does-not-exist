<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-17</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the size and location of SCP-17, containment is difficult. As such, all field research within the perimeter of SCP-17 is to be carried out with the consent and cooperation of the local government.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-17 is a large, empty clearing located in the southern area of Oahu, Hawaii. The interior of SCP-17 lacks regular topographical features, with the only distinguishing factor being a large, flat rock located at the center. Underneath this rock, a partially excavated wooden structure has been found. Despite this excavation, no additional remains have been discovered that could be identified as discrete individuals or groups.</p><p>SCP-17 was discovered in late 2002 by local authorities following several reports of missing persons that occurred within the area of SCP-17. Once the anomaly was contained and research underway, it became apparent that each missing person had disappeared while visiting SCP-17. The Foundation was called in after it became evident that there were similarities between all victims.</p><p>Interview 17-1:</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ██████</p><p>Interviewee: Scott Healey (age 23)</p><p>Dr. ██████: Good morning Scott. Let's start with some basic information about you, shall we? What was your occupation prior to the disappearance?</p><p>Scott Healey: Oh god, I'm sorry for asking these questions already but I have to know. I can't sleep at night if I don't know what happened to him…</p><p>Dr. ██████: Please bear with me Mr. Healey; it will help us sort out a timeline more quickly as well as getting to the relevant details regarding your case. When did you first notice something amiss?</p><p>Scott Healey: Well… It was a typical day at work, but I wasn't doing anything worth mentioning so I thought I'd try my luck with my mom while waiting to clock out. All she said was "Why would you want to do that at this time?" She's so used to my excuses anyway… She didn't believe me when I told her anything had happened when I got home and she said it was nothing until she heard something on news in the morning.</p><p>Dr. ██████: And how long after did you hear about him then?</p><p>Scott Healey: Two hours later, they went live on tv saying he'd gone missing from his job at ████ ███████ where he worked nights around 10 PM on Friday the 18th of January 2001… That's when things changed for me and everyone else here at work…</p><p>Dr. ██████: So let's move forward then; approximately how long did it take you to go home that evening? Do you remember what time exactly you got out? And what time did you arrive home?</p><p>Scott Healey: No idea man! Sorry… This is the part where memory starts becoming hazy… At least 7 maybe 8 o'clock? …and yeah, I want to say 9 or 10 because there were people still left in front of our house talking before 9 o'clock… But I really don't remember much because it feels like another life ago now… Aw man… It hurts every time…</p><p>Dr. ██████: It's okay Scott; just try not to think about it too much more today okay? For one thing you might tire yourself out later on if you do so we can make sure everything goes smoothly for your initial interview tomorrow night then we can go from there. Now let's move on to the next question then?</p><p>Scott Healey: Okay… Okay! To be honest, sometimes my mind doesn't process things normally anymore but I'm trying! Right? Right?!</p><p>Dr. ██████: Yup straight ahead! Your sister reported that she saw your truck parked up facing north towards [REDACTED] Park earlier today and that she assumed that you had gotten out in between 2 and 3 o'clock right? Is there anything else you remember seeing or doing when you got home before she drove off with her two kids? You said she saw your car facing north towards [REDACTED], so are either of those places familiar to either or both of you before this incident happened?</p><p>Scott Healey: Naw man… That's all there is. A couple friends thought they saw us get back together around 1230 or 1300 but they aren't anywhere near us so why should we return home together at all?! The kids weren't theirs anyway… God i wish we could get this done already! …to be honest though - There was an old man who saw me come in through the front door and he looked like he was scared shitless too so maybe he knew what happened alright?! Sore subject huh?</p><p><End Log></p><p>Closing Statement: Interviews with other family members of all previous victims have revealed similar results; seemingly consistent stories regardless of which family member was interviewed and all confirm that no definite cause for their disappearance exists.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>Due to the similarity between all of these events, it is believed that they all happened at the exact same time. The following is a list of items and locations that are known to have been involved in each event:']</p>
