<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-891</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-891 is to be kept in its base, located within a standard containment cell. SCP-891 is to be kept in its base, with all power sources disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-891 is a defunct disco ball machine, manufactured by the ███████ Company in 1957. The object has been confirmed to be non-anomalous and not radioactive, as confirmed by many tests.</p><p>The function of SCP-891 is to play music from any source connected to a record player, if any. However, the sound will be distorted, and will sound like static, regardless of the output quality of the record player. Attempts to repair SCP-891 have proved unsuccessful; most attempts have resulted in the malfunctioning machinery of SCP-891 exploding or sparking, thus destroying what was attempting to be repaired.</p><p>A small note attached to the object reads:</p><p>"Welcome to ██████'s</p><p>Drink up, you're all on our team!</p><p>We're gonna win that game!</p><p>[sic]</p><p>"</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>On 06/07/1958, SCP-891 malfunctioned and began playing a song consisting of three separate melodies. As no known music files are stored on the object, this was concluded to be an anomalous event. The object was quickly contacted by Foundation agents, and brought in for testing.']</p>
