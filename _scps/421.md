<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-421</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A perimeter of 2 km has been set up around the object, and is patrolled by five security experts at all times. Radar-tracking equipment is to be installed around an outer radius of 50 km, just outside of the perimeter. A staff of 10 persons is to oversee the operation of the tracking station, along with one nuclear physicist as a liaison to provide assistance in solving any complicated containment issues. As priority one for research is the exploration of moon resources, two rovers are to be constructed and will serve as the habitat for a staff of three individuals.</p><p>The duration of this research project is pending approval from the Ethics Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-421 is a large, dark, floating spherical object, approximately 200 meters in diameter. The surface of the object appears to be made out of an alloy of iron and nickel that is inclined at a 45 degree angle (this is not absolute – the gravity due to the moon’s mass has been calculated to account for this). There are no openings or visible means of access on any part of the object. The surface appears to be completely smooth, but with a texture that gently rolls inwards towards the center.</p><p>On the side facing Earth there is a single etched symbol that has been consistently estimated as being approximately 2 meters tall by 4 meters wide. This symbol is stylized to look like a face with large red eyes, with two long horns on top of its head that point upwards. The symbol changes position with respect to Earth every 16 hours and 21 minutes. In all recorded cases it has remained within a 5 km radius of the object since first observed. As such, attempts to photograph or film it have been met with failure and adverse effects on equipment used.</p><p>This symbol has been documented to change over time, from one form to another – sometimes very slowly, sometimes rapidly. The following chart displays the current known forms:</p><p>SCP-421 was discovered during a routine lunar orbit survey when a Foundation satellite spotted the object. Upon analysis, SCP-421 was determined to be an artificial artifact created by unknown beings which possessed intelligence greater than human levels on our own planet, though not nearly as great as other entities known on other worlds in our solar system. It was determined that no other lifeform capable of creating an interstellar spacecraft would possess biological technology of similar effectiveness as humans – hence only bipedal organisms could create what we currently know as SCP-421.</p><p>An exploratory mission was dispatched to verify the existence of life on other bodies in our solar system that could produce comparable technologies to SCP-422. Up until this point all expeditions have failed – no lifeforms aside from humans can produce satellites that can orbit around our moon without falling through its gravity well.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 421-1:</strong> Research Log 421</p><p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Dr. ████████</p><p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Introduction of lunar soil into a large chamber, and observation of the reaction.</p><p><strong>Observation:</strong> The soil disappears suddenly after a few hours. When observed again, there is no trace of it – the only indication that it ever existed is a small scratch on the surface.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This may not be entirely accurate. It will be necessary to run yet another experiment, using less soil.</p><p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Introduction of lunar soil into a smaller chamber, followed by exposure to a strong electrical field.</p><p><strong>Observation:</strong> The soil disappears suddenly after a few hours. When observed again, there is no trace of it – the only indication that it ever existed is a small scratch on the surface.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There does not appear to be any correlation between the size of the chamber and the amount of lunar soil necessary to produce this effect.</p><p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Exposure of lunar soil to high temperatures for extended periods of time until it melts in a large container.</p><p><strong>Observation:</strong> The soil disappears suddenly after a few hours. When observed again, there is no trace of it – the only indication that it ever existed is a small scratch on the surface.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This appears to disprove previous tests, as it was previously determined that the soil would evaporate before reaching this point. It is possible that the mechanism for this effect may have been overlooked due to the short duration of previous tests. Further experiments must be run with this alteration in mind.']</p>
