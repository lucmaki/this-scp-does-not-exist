<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-395</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-395 is to be stored in a locker at Site-██. Containment locker has been modified with a standard biohazard suit carrying case lid as the only opening fit for SCP-395. Samples of SCP-395 are to be stored in a separate storage locker, and are to be inspected regularly by a member of security staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-395 is a mental aid accessory. All that is known of SCP-395 is as follows:</p><p>SCP-395 was discovered in the possession of John ███████, who had claimed to have acquired it at some point between 2/07/1984 and 3/14/1984. He claimed he had no recollection of how he had obtained SCP-395, but believed that he had been given it by a man named Ray █████, who had claimed to be a sailor during World War II (the events described by Ray are not confirmed). John did not recall Ray's name, and only remembered that Ray wore a green uniform. This information corresponds with later reports of SCP-395.</p><p>John ███████ claims to have used SCP-395 on ██ occasions, but cannot remember the name of any individuals involved with these events. The effects of SCP-395 are consistent with the following list:</p><p>By adding another word or phrase to the sentence inside SCP-395's clear shell, the user can activate one of three different functions for their mental aid agent; each function has its own color which matches the original color of SCP-395's shell.</p>
<p> Addition of "!" to the end of a sentence causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to recall all conversations hosted by John ███████ following instances of SCP-395\'s usage.</p><p>Addition of "!" to the end of a sentence causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to recall every conversation hosted by John ███████, regardless of whether or not he had spoken previously during their conversation. This function has been observed multiple times over the course of SCP-395\'s containment.</p><p>Addition of "!!!" causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to cause hallucinations in John ███████. The hallucinations caused by SCP-395 vary from person to person, but have been noted as being consistent with its other effects. These hallucinations can be recalled by John ███████ regardless of whether or not he had spoken earlier during the conversation.</p><p>Addition of "!!!" causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to cause John ███████\'s eyesight to deteriorate at a rate of ██% per hour.</p><p>Addition of "!!!" causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to cause an obsessive compulsion in John ███████ which compels him to continuously use his mental aid agent in each situation.</p><p>Addition of "!!!" causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to cause the appearance of a human named Ray █████. Ray is similar in appearance to John ███████, and claims that he was a sailor during World War II (his reported age matches that of John ███████). Ray claims that he was given SCP-395 by John ███████ as a gift for his service during World War II. Ray has been observed conversing with John ███████ on multiple occasions.</p><p>Addition of "!!!" causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to cause the appearance of a human named Ray █████ on a daily basis. Ray appears identical in appearance to John ███████, but claims that he was a sailor during World War II (his reported age matches that of John ███████). Ray has not been observed conversing with John ███████ once outside of their initial meeting.</p><p>Addition of "!!!" causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to cause an obsessive compulsion in John ███████ which compels him to repeatedly attempt suicide.</p><p>Addition of "!!!" causes SCP-395 to appear, and open its shell, and activate itself without any previous words needing to be spoken. In this state SCP-395 is able to cause hallucinations in John ███████ which cause him extreme pain.</p>
