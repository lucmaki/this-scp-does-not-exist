<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-885</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Three Foundation agents, posing as employees of the Caddo Nation institutionalizing the indigenous people of Caddo Village, have been placed in the village to monitor and control the spread of SCP-885.</p><p>SCP-885 is currently contained in a single containment chamber. Only Level 3 personnel may enter this chamber. As of 4/29/19, document SCP-885-1 has become obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-885 is a collection of five wooden buildings situated in Caddo Village, located in the southwestern portion of Oklahoma Territory. Each building is approximately 15m in length, with a single story and three rooms (although the second story has been blocked off). The first room contains a crude kitchen, while two rooms on either side feature sleeping arrangements. The remaining two rooms appear to have been residences prior to SCP-885’s formation.</p><p>SCP-885 produces two primary anomalous effects. Firstly, the villagers living within the village will begin to show signs of slow and painful death until they die. Upon inspection of their corpses, it has been determined that all human corpses within the village had traces of the wood used in construction of the buildings. This wood was found to contain a chemical compound most similar to fentanyl, but far more potent. As for the termination method utilized by SCP-885, no definite answer was given as these people were not subjected to any form of physical force or trauma. It has been noted that every victim died after an illness began spreading from their bodies from the inside outwards. Several victims reported severe abdominal pains before their deaths despite not being shown any signs of physical trauma; doctors have suggested that this pain may have been enough to induce organ failure given its sudden onset.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Testing of SCP-885 has been discontinued after the death of site medical personnel Dr. James McPherson. The cause of death was a cardiac arrest, with no signs of physical trauma to the body. Multiple Foundation agents were present during his final moments, including Dr. D’Mello and Dr. Wilson. There are no indications that any anomalous properties were involved in his death.</p><p>Document SCP-885-1</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> 4/29/19</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> [REDACTED]</p><p>P: Mr. Salisbury, I’m sure you are aware of the situation. We still need to figure out our next course of action. I’d like to know what you think we should do at this point?</p><p>S: You want me to be concerned? Is that your way of saying you don’t have a plan?</p><p>P: I’d say it’s more that we not forget our realistic goals. In all honesty, I don’t think we can just let this thing run its course, but there’s little reason to believe we can affect it in any meaningful way at this point.</p><p>S: If you’re trying to get me to agree with you, why don’t you just put it in writing?</p><p>P: There’s no need for that. What I’m trying to say is that it would be wise for us to consider other options for the future. We can’t just let this happen; we must try to prevent more people from getting hurt before it ends.</p><p>S: How could we prevent something that doesn’t exist?</p><p>P: We don’t know for sure if it does or doesn’t exist yet, Mr. Salisbury, but we have to start somewhere. The fact that we haven’t found any evidence of it so far doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist, right?</p><p>S: What are you getting at?</p><p>P: Do you remember how the board meeting went last week? The one where they pressured us into approving the expansion project? I know they didn’t want to do anything that might jeopardize their approval, but…</p><p>S: What are you talking about?</p><p>P: You know perfectly well what I am talking about, Mr. Salisbury. Don’t pretend like you haven’t been thinking about it yourself. You wouldn’t be acting this way if you weren’t considering leaving your own company. Can you really blame them for wanting to move on from the past when everyone else is? Especially when they have no real idea of what might happen from now on?</p><p>S: Maybe this is all just a big misunderstanding, sir. Maybe the board is just looking out for the best interests of the company, and maybe they don’t know what they want exactly because they aren't sure of what they want to do with their lives either. Maybe if they had a chance to talk things over with someone who wasn't so blinded by his own success…</p><p>P: I'd rather not hear about your thoughts on the matter, Mr. Salisbury. It isn't going to do anybody any good if you keep feeding me your so-called 'plans' for the future of your own company when we both know that's not going to happen anytime soon. We shouldn't waste our time on fantasies; there's too much at stake now to worry about some theoretical future that might never come true in reality. We have a job to do now, and we have to make sure we do it right now before anyone else gets hurt again."]</p>
