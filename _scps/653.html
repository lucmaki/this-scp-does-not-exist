<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-653</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-653 is contained in a standard containment locker at Site-34, where it is to be kept in a non-hazardous liquid medium. Any further testing involving the object must be approved by personnel with level 4 clearance or higher, and has been approved for testing purposes through Dr. ██████.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-653 is a liquid, apparently an aqueous suspension of carbon dioxide molecules (hereafter SCP-653-B) that has been saturated by water vapor to a saturation level of 55%. The density of the object is 1.3 g/cm, matching the density of water, and does not appear to change in any measurable way when subjected to different pressures.</p><p>The object will be affected by forces applied to it. When acted upon by normal physical forces, such as touch or shaking, the object will flow freely through its suspension medium. When acted upon by greater forces, the substance will increase and decrease in volume quickly, resulting in significant changes in pressure and temperature.</p><p>Although the force applied to SCP-653 appears to have an effect on SCP-653 itself and its behavior, the more force applied, the less effect SCP-653-B has on those who interact with it. An individual who is saturated by SCP-653-B will be resistant against additional forces applied to them previously. This limits the ability to lift objects weighing over 0.03 grams using only their hands. A person who is saturated by SCP-653 will not feel discomfort or pain from such forces until their saturation level reaches a value exceeding their own mass. When saturation reaches their weight, they will fall unconscious from lack of oxygen, due to decreasing tissue oxygenation and increasing pressure leading to hypoxia.[C]</p><p>Consumption of any fluid fluid containing the substance has resulted in death for all test subjects immediately following saturation; however, live human test subjects have survived up to 21 days without food or water, although they show signs of fatigue and dehydration. Experimentation into these effects are currently ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>Experiment Log SCP-653</p><p>The following log is an ongoing log of testing conducted with SCP-653. This log is currently the only record of how SCP-653 behaves in the event of saturation by water vapor.</p><p><strong>Day 1:</strong></p><p>Subjects: D-654, Dr. ██████, and two medical personnel.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject D-654 was placed into a chamber containing water vapor at a saturation level of 55%. Subject Dr. ██████ was then asked to touch the fluid and note the saturation level.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject Dr. ██████ reports a saturation level of 55% at 0:45. The chamber is then sealed and tested for another 30 minutes. At 30 minutes, subject Dr. ██████ reports a saturation level of 77%. Chamber is then unsealed, and subject D-654 is removed and placed under medical care. Attempts at removing D-654 from the chamber have been unsuccessful. Following this, the chamber has been sealed again and tested for another 30 minutes, with subject interacting with it for the first time since saturation began to happen. At 30 minutes, subject D-654 reports a saturation level of 93%, with no signs of being affected by the saturation levels so far. Chamber is then unsealed again, and subject D-654 removed from chamber and placed under medical care.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Following the test, it was brought to the attention of Dr. ██████ that the saturation level may be rising exponentially rather than linearly as expected.</p><p><strong>Day 13:</strong></p><p>Subjects: D-654, Dr. ██████ and two medical personnel.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject D-654 was placed into chamber containing water vapor at a saturation level of 55%. Subject Dr. ██████ was then asked to touch the fluid and note the saturation level.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> At 0:00, subject Dr. ██████ reports a saturation level of 78%. Chamber is then sealed again, and subjected to a second test period of 29 hours and 48 minutes, ending at 12:49 on Day 23. At this point, saturation reached a value of 99%. Chamber is then opened again and subjects removed from chamber. Subject Dr. ██████ reports no change in saturation level despite no interaction with SCP-653; however, subject D-654 shows no signs of being affected by saturation levels so far beyond their normal maximum tolerance limits. Both subjects are placed into medical care.']</p>
