<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-687</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-687 is contained in a standard containment locker at Site-77. The locker is to be fitted with an independent air handling system, one opening for gas removal, one for replacement, and two intake openings; this system is to be checked at least once a month. The locker itself is to be monitored for tampering and any anomaly related to the containment of SCP-687 is to be reported immediately to the Level 3 security staff.</p><p>All persons or objects who come in contact with SCP-687 are to wear full body protective Hazmat suits at all times when near or inside the containment area of SCP-687. Any personnel entering SCP-687's containment area are not permitted to remove their masks until they have been decontaminated and are deemed to be safe and stable by level 3 personnel. After being decontaminated and approved, a hazmat suit can be removed without further permission from assigned security personnel. Due to the nature of SCP-687, it is recommended that only Level 4 personnel enter SCP-687's containment area, with Level 5 personnel as backups if necessary.</p><p>Any personnel attempting to exit the containment area of SCP-688 must first report their status to level 3 security station. Only security staff may enter SCP-687's containment area and enter the airlock unless level 3 personnel deem it safe for them to do so. All members of security are trained in double or triple hand entry techniques, where you place both hands in front of you and push against each other before exiting the airlock.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-687 is a strange form of matter which inherently changes shape and form depending on the configuration of its containment area. The more restrictive, less accessible areas of SCP-687 are the most resistant to change. Due to this, it is theorised that the airlock leading into SCP-687's containment area is the only "safe" way for personnel to enter and exit SCP-687 (this does not apply to testing with D-class personnel, as D-class personnel do not have standard methods of containment).</p><p>SCP-687 has three primary forms:</p><p>Two new forms have been observed in testing:</p><p>SCP-687's functions and capabilities are all dependent on its configuration in its containment area, whether it be inside or outside. One notable difference between samples of SCP-688 is how long they take to take form on a flat surface compared to their various configurations in water.</p><p>SCP-687's most dangerous ability is its complete lack of control over the conditions of the containment area it inhabits. All attempts to force it outside of these conditions result in failure. This knowledge gives us some idea of how dangerous this anomaly could be to an unprotected population. It also means that ingress and egress through SCP-687's airlock cannot be controlled easily or reliably enough to be helpful in maintaining containment.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> The following are the results of testing with SCP-687 on a rough-textured surface.</p><p>The following is an excerpt from a report by Dr. Charles T. ██████, detailing the effects of SCP-688-A exposure on test subjects.</p><p>Subjects were exposed to SCP-688-A for varying lengths of time.</p><p>Subjects were interviewed and asked to comment on the effects of the experience.</p><p>Subjects were given a standard interview and then asked to sign a non-disclosure form with all relevant information on the effects of their exposure to SCP-688-A included.</p><p>Subjects were put into a double or triple hand entry procedure using airlocks, and then allowed to exit the airlock and remove their masks.- Only two subjects had any difficulty in removing their masks after exiting.</p><p>All subjects were questioned regarding the quality of sleep they experienced during their exposure to SCP-688-A.</p><p>All subjects experienced extreme amnesia after exposure to SCP-688-A, which persisted until the interview was over. All subjects reported that they remembered nothing after being exposed to SCP-688-A, regardless of how long they were exposed for. All subjects reported that they had been asleep for most of their exposure to SCP-688-A. Subjects reported sleeping for 8 hours when first exposed, but this quickly dropped down to less than 2 hours after 4 hours of exposure, and then no more than 1 hour after 8 hours of exposure. It was noted that some subjects claimed they had slept while exposed, even though they could not remember doing so; however, only one subject claimed to have slept while exposed to SCP-688-A for longer than 8 hours, and this subject was suffering from sleep deprivation due to other circumstances.</p><p>One subject was later interviewed again after several months of self-induced hypersomnia (excessive sleeping) following his initial exposure to SCP-688-A. This subject had been sleeping in excess of 12 hours at a time for months, using various methods such as sleeping pills and heavy sedation in order to continue sleeping during his self-imposed starvation technique (see Experiment 643). Despite being awake for extended periods of time, this subject's memory was still very poor in comparison to normal people who sleep normally; he could not recall his name or what he had done during his year of sleep deprivation, although he could remember most details about his life during this period. He also stated that he did not experience any negative effects from his year of extreme sleep, noting that it did not spoil his life or make him unhappy; in fact, he stated that the lack of emotion left him feeling more capable and confident than he had felt before his year of sleep deprivation. This subject suffered severe depression due to his inability to recall basic aspects of his life following his year of extreme sleep; however, after coming out of his depression he stated that he felt more capable and confident than he had before, even though he still had no memory of his time sleeping with SCP-688-A.</p>
