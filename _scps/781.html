<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-781</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-781 is contained in a 10 x 10 m Standard Humanoid Containment Cell, furnished with standard prisoner's rations. Due to its size, SCP-781 requires more than the standard one guard to observe it. During its containment, SCP-781 is permanently under observation by at least two guards outside the cell door at all times. The Foundation has also contracted a team of guards and investigators to track down any individuals who have seen SCP-781 in the wild. These individuals are currently limited to ██ people, and have been interviewed for information about locations where they may have seen or interacted with SCP-781.</p><p>Any persons suspected of being involved with SCP-781 are to be detained and administered Class-C amnestics as soon as possible. Any attempt to communicate with SCP-781 witnesses should be discouraged unless working on an official Foundation assignment; providing non-Foundation personnel with any information on SCP-781 could result in catastrophic damage to the reputation of the Foundation.</p><p>SCP-781's environment has been kept free from any organic matter to prevent it from becoming distressed and attempting escape; any excrement produced by SCP-781 is recycled and used to fertilize plant life. All attempts to collect DNA from SCP-81 are classified Top Secret at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-781 is, on the surface, an adult male Common Green Iguana (Iguana iguana). SCP-781 has been observed to shed its skin several times over the course of its life. The new layers of skin will continue to grow and change shape before SCP-781 begins to walk and appear more human. SCP-781 has been observed to eat a variety of plant matter, including grass and leaves. SCP-781 displays no signs of pain or illness and does not suffer from any physical abnormalities.</p><p>SCP-781 was discovered in the interior of a freshwater lake in Baja California, Mexico. DNA tests conducted on common ground iguanas revealed that SCP-781 was the offspring of an unrecognized species, which differs significantly in appearance and physiology. While this difference is accounted for by its anomalous appearance, it is yet to be explained how SCP-81 maintains its bodily functions while shedding its skin; SCP-781 shows no signs of difficulty with this task when compared to any other reptile.</p><p>Modes of Communication: Because of the nature of SCP-781's ability to alter its appearance, there is currently no way to record or transcribe a message into a form that will be understood by it; however, messages can be written on non-organic substances such as paper, plastic wrap and cloth, which will be processed by SCP-781 despite its unusual appearance. These materials are placed in locations chosen by SCP-781 whenever possible; at least one such location must always be located within sight of where it sleeps.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-781 was initially contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-43; however, after an incident involving the destruction of a water tower and the near-disappearance of ██ personnel in ██/██/████, SCP-781 was moved to a larger facility which poses less risk of direct exposure to its anomalous properties.</p>
