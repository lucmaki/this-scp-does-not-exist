<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-688</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-688 is currently contained inside a standard Humanoid Containment Cell in Site-64, with full view of the facility's main camera feed. Access to SCP-688 is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher, as research into its properties could prove hazardous to Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-688 is a collection of approximately one thousand bricks that resemble perfectly smooth, perfectly square irregularly-sized bricks. While the number of bricks present varies from specimen to specimen, specimens are always displayed in sets of ten or more.</p><p>When placed into an empty space, SCP-688 will immediately expand outward and fill the void with perfect copies of itself. These copies appear identical to the original in all respects except in pattern, which can vary between different sets of SCP-688. When multiple specimens are placed into the same space, they will separate into smaller groups of SCP-688.</p><p>When SCP-688 is removed from a space, it will immediately collapse and reform into a single brick. If multiple specimens are removed at once, they will collapse into their constituent pieces and reform as intended by the designers. The bricks do not appear to be indestructible in any way; they will break apart if sufficient force is exerted upon them.</p><p>SCP-688's anomalous properties become evident when it is placed inside or on top of a structure. When SCP-688 is placed onto a porch or other outdoor structure, the structure will begin to deteriorate at an accelerated rate until it collapses completely into a pile of broken bricks. Removal of SCP-688 does not prevent this effect; however, placement of SCP-688 inside a building does result in complete structural collapse within two hours. Removing SCP-688 does not cause this effect; however, placing it inside a building results in complete structural collapse within two hours.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 688-1:</strong> SCP-688 was first discovered in J█████, Arkansas, USA on ██/██/19██ when a homeowner reported that his home was falling apart after placement of what appeared to be perfectly smooth bricks. Agents were quickly dispatched and the specimen was contained without incident.</p><p><strong>Addendum 688-2:</strong> SCP-688 is currently being studied in conjunction with experiments to determine the mechanism behind its effects.</p>
