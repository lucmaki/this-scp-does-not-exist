<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-65</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-65 is to be kept in a small, airtight room of appropriate dimensions. Personnel should wear gloves when handling the object and be careful not to touch any portion of the surface without proper protection. SCP-65 itself is to be kept in a container specifically designed for SCP-65. SCP-65 can be removed from its container and moved as long as it remains inside its enclosure. Movements exceeding 2.5m/s require the use of a robotic device or staff member to ensure that SCP-65 does not escape.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-65 is a clear, plastic, two-liter bottle which, when placed on its side, forms a perfect replica of itself. When rotated 180°, the top portion transforms into a third bottle. When placed in any orientation it will undergo the same transformation. SCP-65 will not transform into other shapes or sizes.</p><p>When broken or otherwise destroyed, SCP-65 will reappear whole and undamaged in close proximity. New bottles still have the ability to transform when placed upside down.</p><p>SCP-65 appears to have no anomalous properties before being broken or handled by personnel other than Dr. █████████ and his staff. This includes any knowledge gained from handling or studying it in any way before Dr. █████████ and his staff broke it. It is absolutely vital that Dr. █████████ and his staff maintain absolute control over SCP-65 at all times in order to prevent unpredictable effects related to its origin and how it is handled; there are no known ways to safely handle SCP-65 without an exceptional understanding of its properties.</p><p>SCP-65 was found in ██████ General Hospital, ██████████ during routine patient examinations following a small surgery [DATA EXPUNGED]. One container was discovered containing 103 bottles; all of them had been tampered with to produce different objects and shapes when broken. The medical records indicated that the object was initially used for dosing medication to patients, thus [DATA EXPUNGED]. The original owner was apprehended by Foundation personnel and the object transferred to Foundation custody after amnestic interrogation revealed nothing about the origin of SCP-65 and thus could not be used as a control for testing.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-65 was later discovered to have a ██████ serial number on the bottom of the bottle. Foundation personnel have been attempting to track down [DATA EXPUNGED] regarding the ██████ company and its possible connection, but so far unsuccessful.</p>
