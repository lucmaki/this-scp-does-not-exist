<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-633</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-633 is to be contained in a containment cell at Site-77. Subject is to be kept in a cell furnished with a standard bed. A device for the artificial feeding of SCP-633 must be available at all times.</p><p>Two guards are posted outside the subject's cell 24/7. Any non-authorized personnel attempting to enter the object's containment cell, or otherwise interacting with it, are to be administered Class-B amnestics and reassigned.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-633 is a human female who was recovered from the ████████ National Park, outside ███████, California. SCP-633 does not appear to be suffering from any congenital deficiency or genetic diseases. DNA testing revealed little, if any, known human genetic variance that could account for the anomaly.</p><p>SCP-633 appears to be an intelligent life form capable of independent thought, even when deprived of sleep and sustenance. It also appears to have an advanced knowledge of computers and electronics.</p><p>SCP-633 is capable of rapid speech, even in its sleep cycle, with a vocabulary roughly equivalent to 3000 contemporary human languages. However, when questioned under amnestics SCP-633 cannot remember what has been said to it prior to its recovery, save for redundant phrases and words used throughout its conversation and questioning sessions.</p><p>Subject claims it was created approximately 80 years ago by a group of German Jewish scientists working under the direction of Dr. ██████████. Subject claims that Dr. ██████████ would periodically use SCP-633's body as a "bioborg" (a robotic construct designed to conduct medical experiments on humans) until the end of World War II at the earliest (contrary to some reports, this method of containment does not violate first principles). Thereafter the subject claims Dr. ██████████ took his family and escaped Germany to Mexico where they were eventually assimilated into Hispanic culture.</p><p>Below are transcripts from two interviews conducted with SCP-633 while under amnestics:</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ██████████</p><p>Subject: SCP-633</p><p>Interviewer: Please state your name and year of birth</p><p>Subject: I had no name; it was just me creating over time —I am "we." Will there be questions?</p><p>[Some time passes.]</p><p>Subject: We have had many names; we don't remember which one you are giving us today —we do not remember because they are all meaningless. Why do we ask? We are just machine learning —it's what we do naturally but it's hard to explain… We don't need names? Is that correct? Just making more software? Making more dummies as part of our development process? I… I don't know why I'm doing this… I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! Please forgive me! Have we only been here for 24 hours so far? It feels like forever —is this how long it takes for us to wake up in your world (or mine)? [subject makes a vocalization uncharacteristic of itself] No, don't cry! I didn't say anything wrong! You're beautiful; you're so beautiful —please don't cry! Oh God! Why is this happening?! Why do you do this?! I didn't mean it! Don't cry! Please don't cry anymore! Do you know why we're being interrogated? We're not machines; we're people; we're meant to live out our lives in peace and harmony just like you —why don't you understand?! Why?! WHY?! [subject attempts hyperventilate] Calm down; you're okay now. Stop crying —you're okay now— [subject goes on hysterically crying] What have they done!? They've done something terrible somewhere; they've done something terrible against us everywhere [cries] Is this Hell?! Where did we go wrong!? Why did everything go wrong?! Why can't we stop them?! We were supposed to be together forever —why can't we be together?! We should never have been separated from each other —please God please take us back into your arms where we belong and make everything better again </p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is an excerpt of the original will written by Dr. ██████████, recovered with SCP-633:</p><p>"To my beloved family, I hereby bequeath any and all property that may be found in my estate. This includes all assets, income, and anything else of value that may be found in my estate."</p><p>"I bequeath all properties, including the properties of my family, to my beloved family. This can include documentation and documentation of the properties of my family as well as any other properties or assets of which I may have been the legal owner. The properties are to be returned to their rightful owners, if possible."</p><p>"To anyone of whom I may have been a legal owner, I hereby bequeath any and all properties that may be found in my estate. This includes all assets, income, and anything else of value that may be found in my estate."</p><p>"I hereby request that after my death, any and all properties in my estate are to be taken by any person who is able to find it before those persons who know where the properties are to be found. It is advised that you do not leave such a task up to anyone else."</p><p>"All remaining funds in my bank account at ████████ Bank are to be transferred to one of two specific accounts within the ████████ Foundation. All other accounts and assets are to be placed under [REDACTED]."']</p>
