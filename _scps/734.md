<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-734</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-734 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Sector-19. The lock is to be kept locked and the key is to be kept in a secure location. Any SCP-734 instances removed from their original location should be placed in a standard containment locker, and the incident reports filed by staff of the school should be forwarded to Dr. ████ for review.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-734 is a stack of school report cards identical in design and size to those handed out by ██████ High School, the school attended by the subject. However, each card carries a different grade from 1 to 4. The grade on each card is always consistent with the subject's actual grade, but is typically lower than the expected grade due to academic deficiencies.</p><p>When a human being reads one of these cards, they will experience an anomalous incident at their current place of residence. This event appears as a sudden drop in their average grades or test scores; this average will stay low until the subject graduates or otherwise leaves their current location. In some cases, this drop may be significant enough that the subject's expected career paths are altered (see Incident 734-B). Subjects affected by SCP-734 are unable to comment on their grades or improvements in any way.</p><p>Incident Summary:</p><p>Date: ██/██/2013</p><p>Subject: Subject ██████ ██████</p><p>Location: [REDACTED]</p><p>Observed Grade Change: ██%</p><p>Notes: Subject was found erasing student notes from a textbook and replacing them with blank pages during study period. Subject's parents were contacted for questioning.</p>
