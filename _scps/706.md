<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-706</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-706 is currently uncontained. As of now, the Foundation's interest in SCP-706 lies solely in the lost heritage of the Royal House of Idaardøn, which until this day has no direct connection with modern Norway. Investigation into the life and works of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1863-1944) have provided many hints towards SCP-706's origin, but these are yet to be confirmed.</p><p>The remaining members of the Idaardøn Royal family (including King Christian IX of Denmark and Princess Mathilde), their descendants, and other sympathetic individuals with a tendency for schizophrenia should be kept under observation in case SCP-706 manifests itself in any of them. A small number of civilians have been chosen as candidates for containment due to their identification with Munch and his works. These people should be kept under close surveillance, as well as receiving psychological aid when necessary. A small number of members of the House of Idaardøn are known to have dementia, and may or may not show signs consistent with SCP-706.</p><p>Until further notice, information on Munch must be concealed from general public view. Social media outlets (such as Pinterest) are to be monitored for compulsive repetition and spread of information regarding SCP-706.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-706 refers to a series of paintings and sketches, mainly attributed to Edvard Munch. SCP-706 was first acquired in 1990 by the Containment Research Site-691's art collection, and classified as an instance of SCP-████. Following containment breach [DATA EXPUNGED] in 2010, the Foundation reclassified SCP-706 as an instance of SCP-████. However, after investigation and reevaluation, it was decided that the original classification was still valid.</p><p>SCP-706 is colloquially known as "Buy 'Til You Drop", and is considered the most well-known work of Munch. It depicts an image of a melting winter scene with several figures standing on a bridge, leading to a town. One figure is depicted taking a picture of another figure standing in the background, which resembles the later work "The Lake Isle". The original title for this work is "Den der saa spør paa gjennem vuggen - A photo of the painter Edvard Munch at work", but due to its popularity it has since been commonly known as "Buy 'Til You Drop".</p><p>It is currently unknown how many representatives of the Idaardøn were involved in conceptualizing and completing SCP-706. The red and blue colors used in several modifications of it suggest that both Idaardøn royalty and Munch himself are involved in the creation. However, none of them showed any signs consistent with either conditions associated with schizophrenia or dementia. No evidence has been found pointing to any possible source for SCP-706's manifestation aside from itself.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-706 was originally classified as an instance of SCP-████. However, after investigation and reevaluation, it was decided that the original classification was still valid. The following is an excerpt from SCP-████\'s original containment procedures:</p><p>"SCP-████ causes severe hallucinations in all subjects who view it. Subjects report seeing a melting scene of winter scenery, with figures standing on a bridge leading to a town. One figure is depicted taking a picture of another figure standing in the background, which resembles the later work "The Lake Isle". To date, this painting has never been seen in any form save for its own."']</p>
