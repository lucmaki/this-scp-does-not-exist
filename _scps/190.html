<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-190</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The grounds of the Long Meadow Ranch have been secured from trespass in the interest of preserving the site for future study and to allow for the continuing investigation of SCP-190.</p><p>A perimeter security fence has been constructed around the perimeter of the property. The primary gate on this perimeter gate is to remain locked at all times; exceptions to this have been authorized only for research purposes or when an authorized test subject is being transported.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-190 is the designation given to an unidentified entity that appears to be a male horse of the Morgan, Standardbred and Friesian breeds. The entity is estimated to have been born in the year 1840 and is familiar with the region of ████████, Montana.</p><p>SCP-190 has limited high level knowledge of modern human technology, primarily being able to identify interacting components within mechanical structures (e.g. gears, cogs, pulleys) when questioned. Although SCP-190 has shown a preference for associating with humans and ponies, it is otherwise non-hostile towards other animals and has been known to interact with any equine species (including domesticated variants) even when not directly involved in testing procedures.</p><p>SCP-190's anomalous properties become more apparent after exposure to large amounts of data stored in printed and electronic forms. Subjects exposed to large quantities of printed data will quickly become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. This disorientation causes subjects to display symptoms consistent with general cognitive disorders and/or dementia; however, subjects do not show overtly negative responses to these symptoms or have any demonstrable deficits in their cognitive abilities. When exposed to electronic data subjects will become disoriented if they attempt to engage in reading on their own without a device that can interface with said devices. In cases where subjects are unable to assemble this information into functional systems they will immediately lose all awareness of their physical surroundings and lapse into catatonia until physically removed from their environment.</p><p>There does not appear to be any correlation between exposure time needed for these effects to occur in individuals and the amount of data involved; however, records indicate that prolonged and repeated exposure appears to have resulted in severe tissue damage at lower levels of exposure.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
