<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-476</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-476 is presently contained at Site-19. SCP-476 is kept in a standard containment cell with a bed and bathroom.</p><p>At no time should SCP-476 be given access to any kind of reading materials. Any personnel with the misfortune to have read the SCP without prior knowledge of the hazard are required to undergo psychological counseling.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-476 is an adult male Siberian Husky dog. (See Addendum 476-01).</p><p>SCP-476's anomalous properties are as follows:</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 476-01:</strong></p><p>On 19/10/2017, SCP-476 escaped containment through the ventilation grille located in its cell. SCP-476 took an exit from the ventilation system and was observed fleeing into the nearby woods.</p><p>After a period of time, SCP-476 appeared on a nearby farm, where SCP-476 was found by local authorities, who brought it to the local animal shelter.</p><p>The owner of the farm (a Mr. Charles Simpson) came to the shelter and reported that SCP-476 had escaped due to a broken lock. The staff later discovered that Mr. Simpson was not present at the time of escape and had instead been sleeping in another room at the time. Due to Mr. Simpson's consistent reports of being in another room, and lack of knowledge regarding why SCP-476 would attack him, SCP-476's escape was deemed non-anomalous and no action was taken.</p><p>Multiple attempts were made by Foundation personnel to gain access to Mr. Simpson's residence (which is owned by Mr. Charles Simpson's wife) in order to investigate, with no success. According to Mrs. Simpson, her husband's bed is always made and he never sleeps in it."]</p>
