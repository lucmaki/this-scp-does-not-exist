<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-830</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-830 is to be kept in a high security vault at Site-77. The interior of the vault is to be guarded by two Level 3 security personnel at all times. Any person attempting to enter the vault without prior authorization will be denied access and held for questioning until Site administration can determine the person's identity and reason for attempting entry. In the event of a containment breach resulting in the loss of control over SCP-830, the area around SCP-830 is to be quarantined until SCP-830 returns under its own power.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-830 is a large two-person pelican chair, manufactured by ███████ ██████ under the brand name "Ruffian." The name of the chair refers to the folklore of the same name, where one must endure pain before being granted entrance into Heaven. SCP-830 is capable of floating in air due to its propulsion system; however, SCP-830's range of flight is reduced when not in use. SCP-830 was recovered from ██████████ ██████ after spontaneous self-destruction. Two persons were found dead within the wreckage of SCP-830 in unmarked graves; however, no bodies were found outside of the crash site.</p><p>Foundation personnel assigned to secure SCP-830 had established a perimeter around it and began sealing off a number of nearby buildings after discovering its existence. After [DATA EXPUNGED]. When exploration teams located the crashed Pelican, Foundation personnel recovered several unidentified bodies within one building and a number of other unusual objects. After further searches, agents discovered the second grave site containing six additional unidentified bodies.</p>
