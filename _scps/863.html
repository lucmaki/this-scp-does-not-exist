<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-863</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-863 is currently held at Site-██. When the item is not being operated by the Foundation, it is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with at least three security personnel assigned to it. Access is limited to a level 2 keycard, which should be checked carefully for tampering. If SCP-863 is to be operated by an outside party, they are to be briefed on the nature of its anomalous properties, as well as the identity of its owner/operator in case of unauthorized removal of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-863 is a ten-stringed musical instrument, made of rosewood with a black lacquer finish. A scroll of parchment is attached to the item's handle, which bears a single inscription in Old High German:</p><p>Ein gezähmtes Wesen erfreut sich eines Eindrucks von Unverfrorenheit.</p><p>The parchment bears an illustration of a bipedal humanoid wearing an iron mask and carrying a wood-handled scythe. The humanoid's gender is impossible for an outside observer to determine, due to the lack of genitalia on its body. Though it is physically capable of vocal communication, this ability is not currently known to be used by SCP-863’s owner. The wearer of the mask has been hypothesized as follows:</p><p>All attempts to remove the mask from the object’s owner/operator have failed, with all subjects meeting similar fates as those who removed them. Bizarrely enough, removing the mask from SCP-863’s owner has no effect on their mental state or physical wellbeing; within twenty minutes after removing it, they will return to normal behaviour regardless of their mental state while wearing it. In addition, SCP-863 has proven extraordinarily difficult to alter in any way whatsoever, resisting all attempts at modifying the painting or writing on its scroll. Attempts have also been made to remove any nonanomalous objects attached to the instrument itself, but invariably this attempt would also result in failure and any alterations made would revert to their previous properties at the end of seventy-two hours.</p><p>For several years following its discovery in ████████, SCP-863 was kept at Site-██ and studied using Foundation researchers' best efforts. As such, SCP-863 has uncovered many previously unknown anomalous phenomena in its time under their care; some of which were catalogued below:</p><p>Scarabs were found adorning the scroll along with small dents made by human fingernails (which could be removed when SCP-863 was not being operated) over all major areas where parchment should be attached; resulting in a complete loss of distinct points on the image (see Addendum). These areas range from the top left corner that represents one side's torso region and another side's lower arms to large regions that contain numerous human faces and deities. Though such scarabs are usually not particularly unusual in pre-medieval artwork, they are most uncommon in pre-medieval works conventionally attributed to female authorship; these scarabs have been determined to come from somewhere very far away from Germany.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-863 was originally discovered in ████████, Germany, at the home of █████ █████████. Local police had used the object to perform a standard raid on his residence, resulting in his death. A thorough examination of his home revealed that he was not the owner of SCP-863, as it was owned by an unknown man and woman who had been murdered on his front porch. After SCP-863's discovery in his home, his relatives were interviewed and it was determined that he was a distant cousin to the deceased couple.</p><p>When Foundation personnel entered this relative's home they noted that much of the artwork within had been altered, with many of the previously mentioned scarabs being added to previously blank areas of artwork. The reason for this alteration is currently unknown and has been categorized as Addendum-1.</p>
