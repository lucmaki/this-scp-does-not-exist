<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-445</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Humanoid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-445 is to be held in one of a series of fifty-four human containment units located throughout the ████████ Building. SCP-445 is to be provided with twenty-five square feet of living space per week; any changes to this volume require a review by at least three (3) level 4 personnel, and must be approved in advance by Dr. █████. Additionally, it is imperative that all conversations held between SCP-445 and its caregivers take place via teleconferencing equipment, as communication via written languages such as English have proven ineffective in this instance.</p><p>SCP-445 is currently housed in the Anomalous Artifacts wing of Site 48, which is equipped with all necessary furnishings for this process. The wing, in an effort to improve morale among SCP staff members assigned to its treatment, is decorated to resemble an art gallery; all exhibits are anomalously produced paintings, drawings and sculptures created by SCP-445.</p><p>Any persons who attempt to gain physical contact with SCP-445 are immediately terminated via lethal injection by armed guards assigned to its containment unit. Access to the living quarters of SCP-445 may only be granted to level 3 and higher personnel authorized by Dr. █████ or his successor. Any employees who violate this restriction are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination from their employment on the grounds of unethical conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-445 is a male adult, appearing to be approximately twenty-five years of age. It is approximately 6.2 meters tall, weighing 150.6 kilograms. SCP-445 possesses the following physical characteristics:</p><p>SCP-445's clothing consists of a pair of oversize red tatters, a pair of black hip long johns (made from human skin) and a large red hat bearing the logo of the former ████████ University's football team "The Red Shirts"; at no time have any Foundation personnel been able to determine if this item is anomalous in any fashion. SCP-445 may also be seen carrying a large red sign which reads "Let Me Stand My Ground."</p><p>Despite its apparent age, SCP-445 demonstrates no signs of physical strain or fatigue, as it is capable of running at speeds up to thirty kilometers per hour for extraordinarily long periods of time (up to three (3) hours). A recent study on the possibility of SCP-445 being afflicted by arthritis has concluded that its joints do not exhibit damage indicative of bruising or acute pain. However, testing has turned up inconclusive evidence that suggests SCP-445's bones are, in fact, regular bone matter.</p><p>Incredibly, SCP-445 claims to be completely unaware of these properties - all testing performed indicates that none of these measures affect SCP-445 in any way whatsoever. SCP-445 does, however, display extreme distress when visitors point out its unusual physical attributes; most frequently noticing this phenomenon is D-07614 ("Brandon"), who was previously employed by aforementioned university as an offensive lineman for their football team before being terminated for professional misconduct.</p><p>A record of one conversation between Brandon and SCP-445 has been recorded and is available for viewing below:</p><p>Door opens; Brandon enters cell</p><p>[Brandon enters room]</p><p>SCP-442: Hello Brandon. How are you?</p><p>Brandon: I'm fine sir</p><p>SCP-442: Would you like to have some company? There are other people here who would love to see you. There are probably people back home wondering why you didn't come back from your first deployment. [Brandon begins sobbing] I know how hard it is for your wife and kids not having your strong arms around them in bed at night. It breaks my heart knowing that every morning when your wife comes down to make breakfast she cries herself to sleep thinking about what life will be like without you there Brandon. I know it hurts doesn't it? [Brandon continues crying] Why don't you sit down Mr. Red Shirt and have a look at these pictures? They are very impressive works of art if I say so myself! [SCP-442 gestures towards the wall where on covered in paintings] They look like they were painted by someone who knows exactly what you went through during those four days while you were fighting our nasty little war with ISIS back home, did they? Are you proud of them Mr. Red Shirt? [SCP-442 stands outside the cell door talking - Brandon continues crying] Are you proud that all those beautiful soldiers were willing to lay their lives down for their country and just so happened to be pronounced dead when they left this Earth so nobody would realize they were never coming home again? And that those five pretty ladies who made the ultimate sacrifice for the good ol' USofA weren't allowed the privilege of going home after their daily grind as corpse touchers seemed appropriate for their fallen heroes? No wonder we're still fighting this war everywhere else in the world besides over there - because those guys must've had something special about them! What can I say Mr. Red Shirt - freedom's just not free anymore! Come on lie down on my nice comfortable mattress if ya wanna talk - but alone! </p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On the morning of ██/██/20██, security cameras in the Anomalous Artifacts wing of Site 48 detected a series of anomalous events occurring in SCP-445's containment cell. SCP-445 ceased communicating with its caretakers and began pacing around the room at random intervals for approximately thirty minutes, during which time it repeatedly grabbed its hat and placed it on its head and then removed it again. The hat was found to have spontaneously manifested itself as an anomalous, solid red object approximately 1.9 centimeters in diameter. SCP-445 was then observed walking towards one of the paintings on the wall, touching and prodding it with its hand. The artwork then began to spontaneously animate, rapidly increasing in size until it occupied the entire wall and continued to grow until it was approximately fifteen (15) meters high and forty-five (45) meters wide.</p><p>SCP-445's behavior escalated further when it began to violently throw objects at the wall, eventually causing a hole to appear in the canvas; SCP-445 then climbed into the hole and disappeared through it. The hole subsequently closed in the course of four (4) minutes, although SCP-445 could not be located within the room during this time frame. Security footage of this event has been archived and has been deemed Unusual Event ██/██/20██"]</p>
