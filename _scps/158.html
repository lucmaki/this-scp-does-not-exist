<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-158</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-158 are to be contained in a standard containment locker at Site-77. A video camera, the subject of SCP-158's anomalous properties, is to be mounted on the ceiling of SCP-158's containment cell. A digital thermometer, calibrated to register subzero temperatures, is also to be kept near SCP-158.</p><p>Security personnel are to be assigned to guard both SCP-158 and its containment locker while they are awake. Discovery of any additional instances of SCP-158 requires immediate deactivation until such time as they can be contained.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-158 is the designation given to a group of hermit crabs. The group as a whole possesses no unique traits or characteristics beyond that possessed by individual members and has not been observed to display any anomalous effects except for SCP-158-1. Instances of SCP-158 are one meter in length, with many of the larger specimens measuring 1.4 m. All instances of SCP-158 are female. Instances typically appear to be individuals that have had their male reproductive organs surgically removed from them. There is no significant difference in appearance between instances regardless of size or gender.</p><p>Instances of SCP-158 will launch themselves at an object held within their pincers, quickly reducing the object to dust. Instances primarily attack with their pincers, but will also drop themselves on top of an object and attempt to crush it using the weight of their bodies. Despite being able to reduce objects to dust in mere seconds without apparent effort, instances always manage to remain conscious through this process and require food and water when they are awake. Instances lack teeth, so they must eat plant matter (leaves and berries) before attempting to crush objects using their body weight.</p><p>SCP-158 was discovered on ██/██/19██ when two security personnel were tasked with watching over its containment cell for two days during which time it attacked three objects placed in its containment cell; a pillow, an envelope, and a digital thermometer. Upon conclusion of this test, SCP-158 proceeded to attack all four items placed in its cell repeatedly until all were reduced to dust. In subsequent tests with smaller or less durable objects, instances will generally cease attacking after destroying one object immediately after completing the test on another object(s). When testing ceased for any reason other than continuing containment procedures, instances would often attack other objects unresisted instead of waiting for instructions from those currently monitoring them.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 158-1:</strong> It has been noted that SCP-158 appears to take the same actions when asleep as it does in its awake state.</p>
