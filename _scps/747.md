<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-747</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-747 is to be stored in a secure locker at Site-19's Research Wing. Only currently employed research staff may enter the area containing SCP-747. Any personnel entering the area are to be monitored for the appearance of any un-anomalous movement.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-747 is an iron key approximately 6 cm in length. Research has shown that it does not contain any anomalous properties on its own; however, when placed into a lock, SCP-747 has the same effect as a level-3 Keter-class anomaly.</p><p>Currently, there are no known instances of SCP-747 outside of Foundation custody. All attempts to find the "source" or origin of SCP-747 have been unsuccessful.</p><p>When inserted into a lock and turned, the key materializes at an unknown location inside the building. The object is capable of reaching any building regardless as to whether it has been previously explored or not. The object disappears after thirty minutes (with a maximum of two hours) if none of the individuals present in the building attempted to use it.</p><p>Several tests have been conducted, but none have been able to provide evidence as to what causes SCP-747's anomalous properties.</p><p>Note: A more detailed description of SCP-747's properties can be found [here].</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/201█, SCP-747 was used to travel from Site-19 to Site-17. SCP-647 was discovered fifty meters from SCP-747 at the exact same location that it had disappeared two hours prior. SCP-647 appears to be a perfectly normal key with no anomalous properties as its appearance and handling are identical to standard keys.']</p>
