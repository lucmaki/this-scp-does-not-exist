<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-813</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-813 is contained in Standard Containment ██████████. It is to be kept in a standard containment cell, with a camera installed on the ceiling facing towards its location.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-813 is a large, open room with a camera mounted on the ceiling facing at an angle towards SCP-813. If SCP-813 is not provided with power, SCP-813 will display a picture of itself and its location to any personnel who attempt to view it. Although it has been observed to change from blue to red in order to prompt this behavior, other changes have not been noticed.</p><p>When power is provided to SCP-813, it will immediately begin displaying images of people who are currently seated in front of it. This effect will continue until the power is turned off, at which point it will display the same image again.</p><p>According to Foundation records, SCP-813 was originally discovered in ████████, Japan when local municipal authorities were called to investigate reports of "people" appearing within a public park surrounded by large amounts of foliage. They found no evidence of anyone being present in the area, but cameras pointed at the location showed a different result. After further investigation, local police were alerted and they sought out SCP-813 as a potential security threat.</p><p>During initial investigation of the area surrounding SCP-813, officers entered the building and discovered several people inside while they were investigating the anomaly. All subjects required sedation after contact with them was made; however, all claims that they were present before entering the property were proven false by Foundation teams sent to collect them. An agreement was reached between Foundation and local authorities stating that all residents were amnesticized and returned to their homes with no knowledge of what transpired at SCP-813.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/20██, an agent attempting to visit SCP-813 was recorded as saying, "This place is a little scary, but I guess it\'s safe." The recording was then deleted after the agent was reported to have left the area. However, the agent returned to the location within three days and attempted to enter SCP-813 again. This had no effect on the original recording. Since then, no other subjects have been recorded attempting to enter SCP-813, though it is unknown how many more agents were affected.</p>
