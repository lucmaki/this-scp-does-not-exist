<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-853</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-853 is currently confined in a 5 kilometer by 4 kilometer area built around an abandoned power plant and populated with feral plants. Security personnel are to patrol the perimeter and prevent SCP-853 from escaping.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-853 is a population of approximately 2000 living creatures resembling insects, approximately the size of common housefly. SCP-853 moves in groups of ten to around 100 at any one time; given its constant migration throughout the area, it is difficult to estimate a true number. The individual members are capable of independent movement, but most often appear in homogenous mass.</p><p>SCP-853's specific biological composition is unknown; samples have proven resistant to temperatures of 2,500 degrees Celsius and pressure greater than 5 gigapascals. They are able to consume varying amounts of thermal energy from ambient heat sources, and seem to metabolize low-temperature organic compounds and plant matter poorly. SCP-853 can also excrete large quantities of partially digested material from its anus when surprised or cornered.</p><p>SCP-853 does not possess eyes or any other organs, instead communicating by means of pheromones. When directed through vocalization, SCP-853 will advance on objects or individuals in an attempt to olfactorily "smell" them. The group itself is capable of self organization, although most instances will flee from danger. Further communication between SCP-853 instances has yet to be observed.</p><p>SCP-853 normally travels in groups, usually migrating towards a particular source of heat and/or nutrition. During this process, it will occasionally come into contact with human activity such as industrial plants or farms, causing minor damage in the process. It appears that SCP-853 is largely unintelligent save for its destructive capabilities; it will ignore objects that it perceives as being harmless (such as abandoned vehicles), and will attempt to avoid larger animals at all costs, preferring to flee rather than attack larger prey regardless of their size (as evidenced by the large scale death of the ██████████ anomalous creature).</p><p>SCP-853 is only naturally active during daylight hours and seems to require high temperatures and/or large quantities of food to sustain itself indefinitely. Long periods without available food cause SCP-853 to enter an inactive state which causes loss of scent and presumably reduced energy output; this state can persist for several days at a time before SCP-853 senses nearby warmth again and resumes normal behavior. As such, the minimum required distance from the nearest object capable of providing sufficient heat is roughly 9000 kilometers.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
