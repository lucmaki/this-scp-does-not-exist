<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-720</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A single internet-accessible computer is to be maintained on all areas containing SCP-720. Under no circumstances is any attempt to access the "John" and "James" entries of the SCP-720 database to be made. Any changes made to the database by any computer, especially those from within Foundation facilities, is to be logged and monitored.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-720 is an Add/Remove Programs utility for the Microsoft Windows operating system. Installing, uninstalling or changing any software or data on SCP-720 will cause that software or data to disappear from the computer's hard drive and be replaced by a new file with no visible file extension. These files are named "John" or "James".</p><p>A one-time exception occurs if a user enters their username (email address) into the application. This user will then be able to access the services subscribed to them in Outlook Express. If a user changes their email account password, they will receive a message stating that their password has been changed; however, no change will actually take effect until the next time the user opens Outlook Express.</p><p>If a digital image (taken on a camera or otherwise) is uploaded via SCP-720 and saved as a JPEG image file, its filename will also contain "John" or "James". It should be noted that these filenames do not appear in any digital directory, but they may be viewed by computers which have previously accessed SCP-720. In addition, if an email client with the BCC option is used, it will send along information about the file to those recipients listed in their BCC inboxes by altering their email address values; however, no further changes will take place on SCP-720 until another copy of the image is saved.</p><p>It should also be noted that if an image is saved as a PDF document instead of a JPEG, its filename will also contain "John" or "James". This filename does not appear in any PDF directory and can only be viewed by computers which have previously accessed SCP-720.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 720-1:</strong></p><p>On 14/08/2008, a user gained access to the SCP-720 database by entering their username (email address) into the application. The user then accessed their email account, which had been forwarded to the Foundation previously by Dr. ████ after a previous incident with SCP-███.</p><p>The user then sent a message to their family\'s account by using the message "James" as the subject of the message and "John" as the body of the message. Hours later, all family members received a message from their spouse, stating that their account has been compromised and has been blocked for "security reasons". The exact wording used by SCP-720 was:</p><p>Hello! It is my privilege to inform you that your account has been blocked due to security reasons. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. To unblock your account, follow the steps below:</p><p>You should receive an email from our staff in no more than 10 minutes. If you do not receive this email, please contact our customer service hotline at 1-800-XXXXX. Thank you for your understanding!</p><p>The user\'s account was unblocked and they were given a new password the following day. A copy of this message was saved in its entirety in the database.']</p>
