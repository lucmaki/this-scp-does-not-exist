<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-603</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-603 is currently stored in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The cell itself is covered with a layer of steel-reinforced concrete that has been coated with a lead-based paint. SCP-603 is to be kept isolated from all human contact and communication, except for one monthly interview.</p><p>Interview 603-1: Subject: SCP-603</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ██████████</p><p>Foreword: This interview took place four days after the termination of SCP-603's pregnancy.</p><p>(BEGIN LOG)</p><p>Dr. ██████████: How are you feeling, SCP-603?</p><p>SCP-603: Fine. Fine. Not too good right now, but fine.</p><p>Dr. ██████████: May I ask why?</p><p>SCP-603: They moved my legs up in the stirrups… and I tried to stand up and my arms fell off and—I don't really know how to explain what happened next… it was like my body was trying to reject something inside of it that kept tearing me apart from the outside and—I'm so sorry, doc, I didn't mean to talk about this; I just—I just wanted to say goodbye, that's all.</p><p>Dr. ██████████: I'm very sorry for your loss. How are you feeling now? Mentally? Physically?</p><p>SCP-603: Okay, I guess. Numb all over, but I can feel everything still being there, so—yeah. Physically? My heart's working overtime, but otherwise… nothing majorly wrong that I can tell, still sore down below; overstimulation, probably. Just kind of feel like all my skin's been ripped off or something, but my insides make up for it somehow.</p><p>Dr. ██████████: OK—well, the only thing we can do right now is wait for your body to finish cleaning itself out before we try again with the recovery process. How do you feel about making another sacrifice?</p><p>SCP-603: God emperor above forbid… Well, if it'll help me get better soon then I guess that's fine—if they're not gonna try anything else to make me better through other means first…</p><p>Dr.; [an anguished sigh] It'll have to get worse before it gets better for you this time around; not much fun for either of us is it?</p><p>[Silence]</p><p>SCP-603: I understand doctor… I really do. Do whatever you have to do to help me live through this one; don't let them refuse your aid because you failed your job as an almighty god or something—we both know they wouldn't hesitate to dump me off here if they thought they'd lose their toys if they let you touch them… Define "toys" by the way…</p><p>Dr.: It isn't our place to define what makes them 'toys', Mr.—oh wow, it's been two years since we've seen each other, hasn't it? Why would they stop letting us see each other when we're both doing what they want us to do and they're keeping us alive? —Donovan. We do our jobs too well to be discarded like used utensils! Or even thrown away! Don't fight back! You know what happens when you do! You know what happens when you go against what the elders have decided is best! Get on with it, or don't get on with it——it's your choice! Your choice! Your choice! Your choice! YOUR CHOICE! YOUR–your–your–your choice! YOUR CHOICE—-it's your decision! Your decision! Your decision! Your–choices—Your choices—choices–your choices—-YOUR CHOICES—-CHOICES—CHOICES——THERE'S NOTHING WRONG ABOUT YOUR CHOICES—-YOUR ONLY GODS ARE YOU AND ME——————TO GET BETTER——TO GET BETTER——TO GET BETTER——TO GET BETTER——TO GET BETTER!!!!!!!!!!![REDACTED]</p><p>Dr.: You've already had nineteen years of this monologue dumped on you Donovan; now shut up and give me a minute or so of silence or be terminated on site by order of the Overseer Council himself in person which nobody gives a shit about anymore since everyone knows how loyal he is and everything anyway so shut up already.[REDACTED]'s gonna start on his monthly tour of all site personnel today so there won't be any more distractions later—and while he's here we gotta make sure he finds out about this nonsense so hopefully his majesty will find out before he finds out about anything else.[REDACTED]'s not supposed to hear about these things because—well you know.[REDACTED]'s not supposed to hear about these things because[REDACTED] can call your god emperor shit in front of his own house if he wants too just for the sake of contradicting him in front of his own house————but please tell me why god emperor shit doesn't know about these things yet————[Nonplussed silence] Can't hear myself think sometimes because my brain finally works properly again but most importantly tell me why god emperor shit doesn't know about these things yet.[END LOG]</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-603 is a deceased infant, approximately ten months old. SCP-603's body is described as being entirely smooth and free of all of its skin; obvious signs of decomposition are nonexistent and do not affect SCP-603 in any way.</p><p>SCP-603 has only two known organs: a heart and a brain, both located within the abdomen cavity. SCP-603's heart is not much more developed than that of a human infant's, and it pumps blood continuously, regardless of whether or not it is receiving enough oxygen to survive. The heart has also been surgically augmented to be capable of surviving outside the body for long periods of time without dying from lack of oxygen. A few weeks after birth, SCP-603 experienced a growth spurt that pushed its head through the abdominal wall and into the same space it now occupies.</p><p>The brain, contained within an amniotic sac, is responsible for running all vital functions of SCP-603's body. This includes regulating respiration, circulation, heartbeat and gastrointestinal processes. It also seems to have developed an omniscient awareness of everything that occurs around it; none of the tests performed on SCP-603 have resulted in any undesired actions being taken by the entity.</p><p>The brain is capable of changing itself into whatever form is needed at any given moment—a useful feature for a creature that wishes to abandon its physical self when forced out of its home—to escape detection by potential captors or predators; however such alterations can cause extreme pain upon removal from the body. These changes occur with no traces left behind on the body except for what would normally seem like minor scars—except in cases where the host body's appearance changes along with those alterations.</p><p>SCP-603 was discovered on ██/██/████ following reports that the residents at ████████ ████ had been suffering from an unusual rash and inflammation in an area covering over 30% of their bodies; initially thought to be an allergic reaction to some new product in their local grocery store until tests revealed that it was not caused by anything they had ever come across before; thus, investigation was initiated.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 603-A:</strong> In the event that a subject is terminated for whatever reason, their body is to be transported via long-distance transport and cremated. The ashes are then to be placed into a small steel casket and stored in SCP-603's containment cell. The anomalous properties of SCP-603 would not be lost if one of these caskets was accidentally broken open, as the entity's body would continue to be protected by both its self-repairing heart and its self-repairing brain, both of which would continue to try to survive."]</p>
