<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-272</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to its ability to operate off of an electrical source, System Batteries have been neutralized and replaced with non-electrical batteries. A permanent containment cell has been constructed in Site-██.</p><p>In the event of an emergency breach at Site-██, the entrance to SCP-272 is to be sealed off immediately and small charges implanted throughout the room. Proximity alarms for all areas containing SCP-272 are to be activated in the event that SCP-272 does not remain contained within its cell. A variation of SCP-272, designated SCP-272-A, is to be contained separately under Containment Protocol XXXX-03a and supplied with a standard Service Battery upon discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-272 is a humanoid entity approximately 1.9 meters in height, with pale skin and dark blue eyes. It possesses no discernable gender or sexual characteristics, but appears to be sterile due to the absence of organs associated with reproduction. SCP-272 has the ability to manipulate electrical energy, which it uses to levitate the mass at its center. SCP-272 primarily inhabits containment areas equipped with a battery system, but has been recorded entering homes when power has been cut off.</p><p>SCP-272 primarily communicates through vocalizations, but also is capable of transmitting information through signs. Instances of SCP-272 are known to spontaneously generate within theaters, offices and other situations where an electrical supply exists. Upon being observed, instances of SCP-272 exhibit behaviors typical for humans in similar circumstances. The behavior of these instances changes depending on the location they inhabit; agents have observed common personalities exhibited by instances of SCP-272 include:</p><p>When the "Opposite" personality is present (as defined in Addendum 272-3) the instance displays violent tendencies and attempts to terminate any living beings within its area of influence. In addition, attempts are made to locate and remove all sources of electric equipment.</p><p>While there have been several reports of this behavior occurring at sites where non-anomalous products are produced, efforts have not yet been made to research the source or origins of SCP-272.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 272-1:</strong> SCP-272 was initially discovered in ██████, ██████, where it had been responsible for the death of several individuals. It was then tracked to its current location.']</p>
