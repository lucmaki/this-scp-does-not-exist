<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-589</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-589 is to be contained in a humanoid containment chamber. SCP-589 is to be given a standard ration, and provided with access to television entertainment. Any information gained from an interview with SCP-589, or any other source, is to be destroyed after recording.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-589 is a 20 year old man of Italian descent. SCP-589 has been classified as mentally unhealthy, and is currently held in psychiatric confinement at ████ Hospital Foundation. SCP-589 suffered from [DATA EXPUNGED] early in his life, but also has a long history of drug use.</p><p>SCP-589 is an expert typist, and an advanced computer user. SCP-589 is unable to read or write English fluently (though has displayed partial literacy up to the age of 12), though he speaks fluent Italian. SCP-589 has not spoken any language other than Italian since childhood (though knowledge of Italian grammar and pronunciation are well above average), and understands most Italian dialects.</p><p>SCP-589 repeats words and phrases almost perfectly, correct grammar and syntax, even when not attempting to speak English. This ability can be used through means other than verbal speech, as it extends to written language. For instance, after being asked a question in Italian, SCP-589 will demonstrate the proper usage of the word "si" ("yes") without any hesitation or difficulty demonstrating this skill.</p><p>Prior to containment, SCP-059 demonstrated several unusual behaviors including:</p><p>Interviewed: SCp-589</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-589 was interviewed on 7/12/1999. SCP-589 requested a pen and paper, and wrote the following note in Italian:</p><p>I do not trust my translators. I will only respond to questions in Italian.</p><p></p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Anne Lohr, RN, PhD</p><p></p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. Lohr asked several questions in Italian. SCP-589 responded in Italian.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. Lohr:</strong> Good morning, SCP-589. It is a pleasure to meet you.</p><p><strong>SCP-589:</strong> Una volta mi scrivevano "maestro dei canti". Io non sapeva cosa si provava a pronunciare questo nome, ma mi chiedevano "maestro dei canti", e io le rispondevo sì o sì. Ora che ho capito che la parola è sbagliata, non so più cos\'è, ma m\'ha dato una gioia immensa sentire i miei amici che mi chiamavano per nome. Mi dispiace per chi non era come me, ma ho imparato a memoria tutti i nomi dei miei amici, anche quelli che non erano come me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Lohr:</strong> Sir, what is your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-589:</strong> He did not understand this question. The translator said it meant "what is your name" - but he did not know what his name was, or what it meant. They only asked him to reply "yes" or "no" to whatever he could understand, and so he replied in English, that he did not know what his name was. He never knew the name of his family, his friends, his wife - he could not remember them all. And then they asked him if he said "yes" to the question "do you speak English" - and he thought they were asking him if he was American! And then they asked him if he would be willing to work on an American television show - and he thought they were asking him if he wanted to work on the television show Family Guy! When he finally figured out what the word meant in English, he couldn\'t remember it at all! He could only remember the names of his friends and family - because even the word for "family" was only one word in his mind, but that word was useless to him in Italian!</p><p><strong>Dr. Lohr:</strong> Are you saying that you are unable to fully understand English?</p><p><strong>SCP-589:</strong> No no no no no no no no no no. Non capisce la parola inglese! Il linguista diceva che voleva dire "capisco questa parola", ma lui non la capiva! Non poteva ricordare le parole inglesi! E quando arrivava al punto che poteva nominare le persone che amava in inglese, non lo sapeva né la parola inglese né il numero di parole per "amore". E alla fine il linguista gli ha detto "non sai niente di niente," e lui ha detto… "non capisco niente".</p><p><strong>Dr. Lohr:</strong> I see - you were born with a very advanced skill for languages - the ability to learn languages without actually knowing how to use them? How does this make you feel?</p><p><strong>SCP-589:</strong> They told me I was stupid! Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb! Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid! Stupid silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly silly nonsensey I don\'t understand why they made me learn everything! Stupid silly foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish foolish ridiculous!! Stupid magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic magic nothingness!!</p><p><strong>Dr. Lohr:</strong> Sir? What is this about?</p><p>SCP-059 begins to cry uncontrollably. Dr. Lohr asks him if everything is alright - SCP-059 makes an attempt to compose himself before continuing his conversation with Dr. Lohr in Italian.']</p>
