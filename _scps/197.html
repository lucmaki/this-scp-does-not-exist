<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-197</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-197 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. SCP-197 has shown no signs of suicidal tendencies, and should be given an adequate diet consisting of plant matter, animal products, and yeast. No water may enter the cell; any that does so is to be discarded.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-197 is a male humanoid, with the physical appearance and general behavioral patterns of human males. It is approximately 2 cm in height and weighs approximately 1 kg. SCP-197 is mute and will not speak, though it is capable of vocalizations (see Addendum 197-1).</p><p>SCP-197 is able to manipulate money, coins, jewelry and other assorted valuables with abilities similar to those of a standard magician. When presented with valuables, it will "magically" perform slight modifications (such as making the item appear to weigh less or heavier) and then perform small rituals over the object while chanting incantations.</p><p>When presented with a large amount of money (including currency from a variety of nationalities), SCP-197 will attempt to double its current holdings; if successful, it will lose the ability to function normally until it has gained all of the money back. SCP-197 will then repeat these actions indefinitely; however, any increase in wealth does not allow it to gain more wealth than what was paid at the time.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 197-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-197 was given the opportunity to leave its cell. After an initial refusal, it then agreed to be left in its cell until further notice. It is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, with no access to food or water.']</p>
