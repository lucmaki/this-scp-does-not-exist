<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-90</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-90 is kept in an enclosure at Site-77. SCP-90’s enclosure is to be maintained with a reasonable level of room temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and food availability. The enclosure’s floor is to be lined with sand, gravel, or concrete.</p><p>SCP-90 is not to be directly supervised by personnel who do not already have direct experience with electronics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-90 is an Astradroid, a humanoid bipedal robot designed and manufactured in the late 1980s by Insitu Incorporated. SCP-90's chassis is of a solid steel frame that is 5 mm thick. The two rear wheels are connected to servos, while the center drive motor is connected through a central shaft.</p><p>SCP-90 has two arms that terminate in three fingers on each hand. Each end of the arm has six joints at .275 inch intervals. These joints allow for movement in 12 degrees of freedom, which roughly approximates human motion. This motion is transmitted to a wrist joint on the arm’s upper arm. Each shoulder on the arm can rotate independently of its counterparts. The shoulder joints are actuated by servos within the suit’s arms, which also have a range of motion beyond those allowed by human anatomy.</p><p>Each finger on both arms possess four degrees of freedom: finger rotation, elevation, bending and finger extension. Finger rotation is achieved through a joint in each finger; elevation is achieved from a plunger system in the palm of each hand; bending may be achieved through manipulation of flexible thin wires that extend from each fingertip; and finger extension—detectable only with advanced equipment—is achieved by bending the elongated fingertips backward towards the palm to complete an inverted “V”-shape between the palm and little fingers. SCP-90 does not have opposable thumbs due to its design and cannot grasp objects without assistance.</p><p>In addition to its arms, SCP-90 can demonstrate limited locomotion using the “pneumatic shock absorber system” included with its chassis. This system consists of 14 inflatable bladders located throughout the suit's legs, hips, chest and abdomen that allows SCP-90 to bend over when walking or standing up after sitting down. When inflated, these bladders will keep SCP-90's torso upright regardless of body weight distribution, greatly reducing strain on its joints. These bladders deflate after 3 hours of deflation or exceeding 25%, although even when deflated they provide enough resistance to allow SCP-90 to walk at speeds generally below 20km/h (12mph) when tested under extreme conditions such as during evacuations. The shock absorber system also allows SCP-90 to travel extremely long distances without overloading its joints with excessive force.</p><p>Ascertaining exact details about how this system functions has proven difficult due to SCP-90's robotic nature and software lockout preventing access from most modern computing equipment; it is theorized that SCP-90 uses pneumatic pressure combined with counterpressure supplied by compressed gas bladders held by both hands to brace itself against abnormal forces applied at any point along its skeleton.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 90-1:</strong> Recovered Evidence</p><p>The following is a list of recovered pieces of SCP-90's hardware.</p><p><strong>SCP-90-1:</strong> A set of vacuum cleaners consisting of a brush bar and a cleaning head, mounted on the top of a circular plastic housing approximately 10\xa0cm in diameter. The brush bar is approximately 2.5 meters long and has a diameter of approximately 0.3 meters at its tip. SCP-90-1 is completely sealed within its housing, with only an air release valve at the bottom of the housing that allows air to enter through a hole in the middle of the brush bar. SCP-90-1 is currently in Foundation custody, being held at Site-77 with SCP-90.</p><p><strong>SCP-90-2:</strong> A 3 meter long, tubular metal rod, with an open end on one end and a handle on the other. The handle is approximately 2\xa0cm long and has a base approximately 1\xa0cm wide. This device was used by SCP-90 to interact with human beings. It was found outside ██████ ████, ██████, during an emergency evacuation after a fire destroyed three floors of the ████ ████ Hotel on █/██/20██.</p><p><strong>SCP-90-3:</strong> A small, fleshy bundle of wires connected to several motors and sensors at its base. This device was used to communicate with human beings by emitting speech through the jaw opening at the bottom of SCP-90's head. SCP-90-3 was found outside ██████ ████, ██████, during an emergency evacuation after a fire destroyed three floors of the ████ ████ Hotel on █/██/20██.</p><p><strong>SCP-90-4:</strong> A small intact battery pack, containing two nickel hydroxide batteries from a radio transmitter used to contact other instances of SCP-90. SCP-90-4 was found outside ██████ ████, ██████, during an emergency evacuation after a fire destroyed three floors of the ████ ████ Hotel on █/██/20██.</p><p><strong>SCP-90-5:</strong> The motherboard of SCP-90, which contains all the circuitry required for operating and controlling the system components described above and is located in the lower half of its chassis. The motherboard appears to be a standard Intel 8086 series microprocessor; however, it exceeds normal Intel specifications in terms of clock speed, RAM capacity, and CPU cache when compared to comparable Intel models at the time of SCP-90’s design. SCP-90's motherboard also possesses a number of additional components not found in other Intel microprocessors at the time of SCP-90's creation; these include an additional onboard audio processor and an onboard serial port capable of supporting data transfer rates up to and exceeding 5 megabits per second (USB 2.0). Although it is not clear how this feature was implemented, it is theorized that some form of firmware upgrade may have been applied to SCP-90's motherboard following its initial manufacture."]</p>
