<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-198</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-198 is to be contained in a closed container, kept at least one (1) meter from all humans and humanoid mammals with the exception of Foundation personnel. SCP-198 should be placed within a separate room outside of Site-86's premises, and removed from its container on an hourly basis for observation and testing.</p><p>Testing is to be carried out by Level 2 personnel only, with the use of a control group. Regimens are to last for a minimum of three (3) hours, with subjects housed in adjoining rooms.</p><p>Any effect produced by SCP-198 is to be classified as "incidental."</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-198 is a keyboard, originally constructed in Brazil in the 1960s by the Cooperacao Comercial do Brasil (CCB) company. Upon activation of SCP-198, it produces a "dialog" with a music score consistent with the letters on its keys, which are intended to be used through a MIDI interface. The sounds produced by SCP-198 are usually in the range of 8-10 Hz and have been measured up to 4 kHz, matching auditory perception thresholds for humans.</p><p>If played for more than six (6) hours per day, SCP-198 will produce a mild euphoric effect on affected subjects. Subjects will not perceive this as exceptional and will continue to play until they fall asleep.</p><p>Based on neuroimaging studies, this effect seems to involve endogenous cannabinoids in the brain, with an unknown mechanism. Since most of these cannabinoids activate CB2 receptors, several addictive potentials have been proposed by various researchers. However, further testing has proven inconclusive due to a lack of direct evidence; thus no classification can be made at this time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 198-1:</strong> SCP-198 was discovered in a private residence in ██████, Brazil. SCP-198 was found in the home of Mr. ██████, who had reported being unable to sleep at night due to SCP-198\'s effects. The subject, after a series of interviews conducted by Agent ███████ and Dr. ███████, had been classified as "unusual" and was placed under Foundation custody after agreeing to share the night with Agent ███████.</p>
