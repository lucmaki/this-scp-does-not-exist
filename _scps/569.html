<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-569</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-569 is currently kept in a secure storage locker at Site-66. A standard security contingent of three Level 1 personnel guards the object at all times. Any personnel with meeting or class schedules requiring them to be away from their normal post for longer than one hour are to submit a request for leave to their supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-569 is a two-volume textbook entitled "Der Schichtsystem" (Anatomy of the Human Body). The volume forked in half and printed on both sides. The front cover is mostly blank save for the title, author's name, copyright information, and purchase date: 07/12/1987 from an unnamed bookstore.</p><p>The first page of each volume has been extensively altered with the words "For Personal Use Only" written at the bottom in red ink. Although no researcher has yet had the opportunity to read over the entire text of SCP-569, it appears to deal with human physiology in some capacity.</p><p>Proper classification of SCP-569 has proven difficult due to its anomalous properties. The Foundation has so far classified it as a Safe object in light of its scientific nature, but it is currently under review due to its reported physical properties. Reviewers are divided on whether or not SCP-569 should be reclassified as Keter pending further testing.</p><p>Because of the risk posed by SCP-569, a security squad of three Level 1 personnel guards SCP-569 at all times. Any unauthorized changes made to the text have proven destructive in nature; therefore, any changes made to SCP-569 must be authorized by Researcher E███. Any unauthorized alteration of SCP-569 will result in disciplinary action being taken against the individual responsible to include suspension from duty or termination. Access to SCP-569 requires Level 2 clearance and authorization from Director Cass' office.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-569 is currently being reviewed by the Ethics Committee.</p><p>Interview Log 569-1</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Researcher E███</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Cass</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> To date, no researcher has had the opportunity to read over the entire text of SCP-569. In light of this, it is decided that an interview will be held with an individual who claims to have read over the entire text of SCP-569.</p><p><strong>Dr. Cass:</strong> Good afternoon, Researcher E███. I trust you are feeling well today?</p><p><strong>Researcher E███:</strong> Yes, sir.</p><p><strong>Dr. Cass:</strong> Would you mind if we conducted this interview in your office? I would rather not have a large audience present while we discuss SCP-569.</p><p><strong>Researcher E███:</strong> Not at all, sir. Please follow me.</p><p>[Dr. Cass and Researcher E███ enter Researcher E███\'s office]</p><p><strong>Dr. Cass:</strong> I\'d like to ask you a few questions first before we begin our interview, if I may?</p><p><strong>Researcher E███:</strong> Of course, sir.</p><p><strong>Dr. Cass:</strong> I see on your personnel file that you have received several commendations for your work here at the Foundation. Would you mind telling me about those commendations?</p><p><strong>Researcher E███:</strong> No, not at all, sir. I received quite a few for my work on several different projects here at Site-66. I was presented with the Foundation\'s Silver Star Award for my work on Project-17C, and I was given the Foundation\'s Presidential Award for Outstanding Service for my work on Project-23B and Project-27E.</p><p><strong>Dr. Cass:</strong> And what exactly did you do on those projects?</p><p><strong>Researcher E███:</strong> On Project-17C, I was given the task of researching and documenting the non-anomalous effects of high doses of radiation on human subjects. Doctor ██████\'s background with radiation topics made him an ideal candidate for the project, and his results were both thorough and accurate. He was able to find consistent relationships between exposure to different levels of radiation and non-anomalous effects such as hair loss and skin cancers, as well as how much radiation caused these effects to manifest themselves. It was incredibly helpful in the development of containment procedures for multiple Keter-class objects in our database. We\'ve already had several successful runs in our current test chamber with people exposed to similar levels of radiation due to Project-17C\'s results providing us with the necessary safety protocols for safe experimentation in our current wing of Keter containment.</p><p>On Project-23B, I was responsible for defining SCP-682\'s anomalous properties by creating a new classification based off of its actions; thus, SCP-682 was classified as a "Safe Anomalous Object." It is my hope that this classification will help ease our workers\' minds regarding SCP-682\'s anomalous effects, as well as allow us more time to study it without worrying about their safety. It also provides us with more time to develop suitable containment procedures for other Safe objects before they become too dangerous to contain properly.</p><p><strong>Dr. Cass:</strong> Thank you for your time, Researcher E███. I\'ve just one more question before we end up here. If you had to pick one book in all of human history that changed you most in some way, what would it be?</p><p><strong>Researcher E███:</strong> That\'s an interesting question, but I actually don\'t think it\'s one I can answer precisely; there are books throughout history that have changed me immensely in one way or another, but only a few have truly affected me in ways that can be described as life-altering experiences. But if I had to pick just one book from all times that could genuinely change you or your views on life and society as a whole, it would have to be The Urantia Book by [REDACTED]. It\'s been a pretty big part of my life thus far and I\'ve enjoyed every minute of it so far; although, lately it\'s been getting me into trouble more often than not…</p><p><strong>Dr. Cass:</strong> And what do you mean by trouble? It sounds like you\'re having trouble with it again?</p><p><strong>Researcher E███:</strong> Well… yes, actually… the last time we talked about The Urantia Book was when we were discussing whether or not to change its classification from Safe to Keter… but now there seems to be more problems coming up regarding The Urantia Book than previously expected… some of the problems are minor annoyances (like when students come up to me asking questions about The Urantia Book during class), but others are more serious issues (like when teachers assign The Urantia Book as a required reading assignment). You see… ever since we started engaging with The Urantia Book more frequently than usual on staff meetings and staff training sessions… things have gotten… difficult for me sometimes when dealing with patients because many patients seem to have questions about God or Jesus or something along those lines relating to Jesus\' teachings found in The Urantia Book… and sometimes patients will ask me if I believe in God or Jesus or something along those lines… but Jesus isn\'t real! Nobody believes in Jesus! He\'s just a myth! We don\'t worship him or anything! What kind of person would believe in such a ridiculous story?! To think that there could possibly be someone out there who believes that Jesus is real is totally idiotic! And… sometimes they\'ll ask me why they should believe in God instead of Jesus because they find one to be more believable than the other… but God doesn\'t exist either! The story about God originated from a hoax perpetrated by some crazy cult known as the Church of All Worlds which started back in 2137 AUC! And even if God did exist… why would he bring Jesus back from the dead if he didn\'t want anybody to know about him? There absolutely isn\'t any reason for God to do this! How could anybody possibly believe such nonsense?! And what happened to Adam and Eve? Where are they now? What happened after they ate from the tree of knowledge? Did they really get sent away into outer space like they were told? Why didn\'t they ever come back?! And why would anyone want to worship such an incompetent idiot?! We should be worshipping the Great Mother who created the universe; she\'s so much smarter than Jesus who couldn\'t even save himself from dying! What kind of parent would let their child go on such a stupid little suicide mission?! And why are people so obsessed with religion nowadays?! Have they really forgotten how to live their lives without constantly obsessing over what other people think?!</p><p>Anyway, sorry about getting off track there; I just needed some time alone with it so that I could get my bearings back before continuing my report on SCP-569.</p>
