<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-569</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-569 is currently kept in a secure storage locker at Site-66. A standard security contingent of three Level 1 personnel guards the object at all times. Any personnel with meeting or class schedules requiring them to be away from their normal post for longer than one hour are to submit a request for leave to their supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-569 is a two-volume textbook entitled "Der Schichtsystem" (Anatomy of the Human Body). The volume forked in half and printed on both sides. The front cover is mostly blank save for the title, author's name, copyright information, and purchase date: 07/12/1987 from an unnamed bookstore.</p><p>The first page of each volume has been extensively altered with the words "For Personal Use Only" written at the bottom in red ink. Although no researcher has yet had the opportunity to read over the entire text of SCP-569, it appears to deal with human physiology in some capacity.</p><p>Proper classification of SCP-569 has proven difficult due to its anomalous properties. The Foundation has so far classified it as a Safe object in light of its scientific nature, but it is currently under review due to its reported physical properties. Reviewers are divided on whether or not SCP-569 should be reclassified as Keter pending further testing.</p><p>Because of the risk posed by SCP-569, a security squad of three Level 1 personnel guards SCP-569 at all times. Any unauthorized changes made to the text have proven destructive in nature; therefore, any changes made to SCP-569 must be authorized by Researcher E███. Any unauthorized alteration of SCP-569 will result in disciplinary action being taken against the individual responsible to include suspension from duty or termination. Access to SCP-569 requires Level 2 clearance and authorization from Director Cass' office.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
