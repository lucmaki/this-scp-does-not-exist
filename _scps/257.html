<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-257</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-257 is to be kept in standard containment locker 223 at Site-77, with the exception of testing. All staff have been given a detailed briefing on SCP-257's effects as well as its general nature.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-257 is a black glass bottle containing a yellow liquid. Upon opening, the liquid turns to an acid and burns through any material on its path. The distribution of SCP-257's properties are as follows:</p><p>The liquid's burning nature is enough to cover anything within a two-meter radius in flames for up to 2600 cm. The fire it creates will not be extinguished by any other means but the liquid itself.</p><p>SCP-257 was found in ███████, Texas on June 7th, 1976 following the disappearance of [REDACTED]. Initial testing upon SCP-257 revealed that its melting and burning effects would statistically increase in severity with increased mass and density of an object. Testing thus indicates that SCP-257's effects change depending on the target object's structure.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
