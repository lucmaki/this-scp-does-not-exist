<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-11</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-11 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-28. No personnel are to come within 50 cm of the object. SCP-11's anomalous properties will activate if anyone has more than 5 non-SCP objects in their possession, excluding SCP-11 itself.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-11 is a large (approximately 3 m in height) stone head. SCP-11's anomalous properties activate when more than five unrelated objects are in contact with it simultaneously. Once activated, SCP-11 will animate itself, and start floating towards the closest instance of each object it recognizes as an entity.</p><p>After reaching the entity being targeted, SCP-11 will proceed to remove portions of its body until only a core remains. SCP-11 will then animate this core into a human form and attempt to speak in Chinese. The resulting entity will be completely fluent in Chinese and English, and possess all of the personality traits of a regular Chinese person.</p><p>Upon further examination, SCP-11 was determined to be composed of several previously unknown materials, including:</p><p>SCP-11 has shown no signs of mobility or illness. Furthermore, all previously observed instances of SCP-11 have been heavily deteriorated, and show signs that SCP-11 was transferred/exchanged multiple times for different materials between points of origin and recovery.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum SCP-11-1:</strong> SCP-11 has been observed to have no memory of its past instances. Furthermore, it is unclear how SCP-11 manages to keep track of its components and properties, despite not having a central brain.</p>
