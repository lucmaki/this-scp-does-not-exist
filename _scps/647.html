<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-647</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has compiled a list of all establishments that have ever served tacos in the greater Los Angeles area, and are actively monitoring any new occurrences of tacos being served. Due to the scope of this phenomenon, the use of amnestics is considered sufficient, though it is recommended that operatives not familiar with the code be allowed to participate in the operation.</p><p>As for retrieval, it is noted that the best method would be to entice one of the entities to exit its containment and place it within a vehicle (such as a patrol car). This is currently impossible due to said entities' resistance to entering vehicles due to the low temperatures and lack of oxygen. Nonetheless, it is believed that the Foundation will be able to find a way to successfully procure one at some point in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-647 is a series of phenomena known as "Taco," which in this case refers to the consumption of tacos by entities found to currently inhabit the area. These entities have varying length and breadth of existence, although it is believed that there are over 300 instances all located within Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Upon consumption of a taco containing the flesh of these entities, an effect often referred to as a "high" occurs, resulting in an increase in the entity's intelligence and physical abilities and loss of individualism. Aside from being an improvement from baseline human levels, these abilities seem to influence them in positive ways, allowing them to both better interact with each other and understand their environment better.</p><p>It is worth noting that there does not appear to be any discernable reason for why only the individuals who consume these tacos are affected.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum SCP-647-A:</strong> A list of all known entities affected by SCP-647 has been added to the following document.</p>
