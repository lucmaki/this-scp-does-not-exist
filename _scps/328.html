<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-328</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The entrances and exits to SCP-328 are to be monitored for civilian traffic. Any individuals entering SCP-328 are to be terminated immediately through the use of specialized firearms, tranquilizers or other means. Civilians within SCP-328 may only leave the bear in order to retrieve their belongings.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-328 is a small, circular alcove located in the ████████ National Park. The interior of SCP-328 has various signs and slogans scratched into the walls, with some of these signs belonging to various groups involved in the criminal underworld.</p><p>When a human subject enters SCP-328, they will begin behaving strangely, as though they have become a bear. As such, all subjects within SCP-328 will begin searching for suitable sleeping quarters, although they will never sleep while in said space. If they are unable to find suitable sleeping quarters, they may attempt to wander out of SCP-328.</p><p>Within 3 hours of entering SCP-328, all subjects within the location will subsequently undergo [DATA EXPUNGED] and disappear from this world as though they had been killed. In an effort to prevent [DATA EXPUNGED], all information relating to SCP-328 is to be kept secret by O Command.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Following an incident involving the disappearance of several civilian subjects from SCP-328, personnel were sent into SCP-328 to locate the missing subjects. When personnel reached a specific location within SCP-328, they encountered a [DATA EXPUNGED] which was capable of teleporting them out of the bear enclosure.</p><p>Following the activation of this trap, no further civilians have been detected within SCP-328 since that time.</p>
