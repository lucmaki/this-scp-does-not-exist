<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-922</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-922 is currently contained at Site 28. Four Foundation personnel are to monitor SCP-922's activity every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-922 is a female gogosh (Gongylidinae) specimen approximately 1.5 cm long. SCP-922 possesses no visible organs save a pair of cranial antennae.</p><p>When a human being observes SCP-922, the subject will briefly experience an anomalous sensation which they have labeled “mon gogish”. The sensation is described as a feeling of intense enjoyment and arousal, followed by feelings of guilt and depression. Repeating this behavior has been noted to result in a decreased ability to enjoy activities other than those involving SCP-922.</p><p>SCP-922 was originally recovered from the ████ ████████ Zoo in ██████████, England. To date, SCP-922 has not expressed any discomfort at its containment and does not require assistance for normal maintenance.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
