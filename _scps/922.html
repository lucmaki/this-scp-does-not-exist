<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-922</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-922 is currently contained at Site 28. Four Foundation personnel are to monitor SCP-922's activity every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-922 is a female gogosh (Gongylidinae) specimen approximately 1.5 cm long. SCP-922 possesses no visible organs save a pair of cranial antennae.</p><p>When a human being observes SCP-922, the subject will briefly experience an anomalous sensation which they have labeled “mon gogish”. The sensation is described as a feeling of intense enjoyment and arousal, followed by feelings of guilt and depression. Repeating this behavior has been noted to result in a decreased ability to enjoy activities other than those involving SCP-922.</p><p>SCP-922 was originally recovered from the ████ ████████ Zoo in ██████████, England. To date, SCP-922 has not expressed any discomfort at its containment and does not require assistance for normal maintenance.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On 11/25/1993, SCP-922 became agitated during one of its daily routine checks. After initial attempts to sedate it yielded no result, two Foundation personnel were assigned to containing the specimen. When the two personnel engaged in sexual activity with each other, SCP-922 ceased all movement and began licking one of the personnel's feet. The effect wore off after approximately five minutes and SCP-922 resumed normal behavior.</p>
