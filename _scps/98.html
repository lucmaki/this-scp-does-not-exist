<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-98</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-98 is to be kept in a locked safe in the containment wing of Site-77. Any personnel involved in its recovery are to be escorted out of the site. SCP-98 is not to be moved from its original location, and all attempts to destroy it are highly discouraged.</p><p>Living organisms containing SCP-98 must be secured inside a standard Level 3 caging unit. The food source of these subjects is to be replaced daily by Foundation staff; this is also recommended that subjects be removed from their cage at night so no damage will happen to the caging unit during the night.</p><p>Only D-Class personnel with psychological problems are allowed to interact with SCP-98.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-98 is a type of plant native to the Pacific Northwest. It has four main parts: the main stem, flower head, seed pod, and root stock. SCP-98 possesses the ability to produce human genetic material from its rootstock, thus producing organisms containing it. This ability seems to be connected with lighting or heavy rainfall, causing SCP-98 to release this genetic material into the air through its rootstock.</p><p>The average lifespan of an organism produced with SCP-98 is unknown, however all organisms produced have died by the age of five. The form of an organism produced depends on the environment in which it is born; under a dark sky during nighttime, 1/3 of all organisms are tailless variants and look like small tree frogs while 1/3 are tall black frogs with only legs (referred to as "Mummers"). If a rainstorm occurs at night, 1/6 of all organisms are humanoid in appearance. They will usually stand around 2 meters tall and appear to be either richly dressed or poorly dressed depending on their economic status.</p><p>Due to its nature, subjects created with SCP-98 cannot survive outside of their cage without malnutrition or dehydration.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 98-1:</strong> The following is an excerpt from the report of SCP-98 recovered by agents from the Pacific Northwest Regional Office:</p><p>Dr. ██████, this is Agent [REDACTED] in █████████, Washington. We have recovered a new specimen of SCP-98. The material was found buried under several hundred dollars in cash. The subject was dying from starvation and malnutrition, and we believe that a family of trees may have been planted on top of it by the previous owner(s).</p><p>I recommend that we bury it in a casket to keep it safe, but I am also not sure what would be the best way to destroy it.</p><p>– Agent [REDACTED]</p>
