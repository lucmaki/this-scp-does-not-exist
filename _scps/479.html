<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-479</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-479 is contained in a standard containment cell at Site-77. The object is to be kept in a standard containment cell, and made of non-combustible materials. The object may not be removed from the containment chamber without consent of the object's current master.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-479 is an ashtray. It is empty of ash.</p><p>When a subject places an item into SCP-479, the object's anomalous properties activate, and the item will disappear completely. The subject can then speak to the item as if it were still present. However, any attempt to interact with the item during this time will result in some form of feedback.</p><p>SCP-479-A are objects (hereafter referred to as SCP-479-1) that are affected by SCP-479 in a different manner than other objects. Most SCP-479-1 instances retain their structural integrity even when removed from SCP-479, but cannot be easily interacted with. Attempts at communication with SCP-479-1 instances have revealed that they have a strong desire to be released from SCP-479; however, attempts at doing so have not been successful due to SCP-479's anomalous properties.</p><p>Instances of SCP-579 (see below) do not exhibit this behavior; instances of SCP-579 merely pass on a message or statement given by the original sender, regardless of the nature or structure of said message.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
