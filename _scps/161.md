<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-161</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-161 is to be stored in a standard Safe class item locker. Due to its size, 2 personnel must be present when the object is stored. The object may not be removed from its containment unit without permission from at least 1 member of the O council. No fewer than 2 personnel are to monitor SCP-161 at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-161 is a medium-sized rectangular blanket made of various synthetic fiber blends. It measures approximately 15 m x 11 m with depth of approximately 2 m. SCP-161 is both fire and water resistant, however it loses its durability in the absence of heat or moisture.</p><p>When SCP-161 is exposed to temperatures of at least 0° C, it becomes animate and begins moving on its own. SCP-161 emits a hum that remains constant volume, ranging between 50 and 150dB, and pairs of earplugs must be worn by all personnel within 5 meters of the object when temperatures are below -40° C to avoid hearing damage due to noise. SCP-161 does not respond to any external stimuli except for command presence; under this condition, it will stop moving until a figure wearing Foundation issued cold weather gear or carrying an SCUBA tank (containing liquid nitrogen) enters the area in which it is contained.</p><p>SCP-161’s behavior can be described as an attempt to seek out heat sources and to situate itself underneath them for protection. As such, most attempts to use other coverings for the object have failed due to it quickly lifting off such coverings and burrowing underneath them. Personnel handling the object outside of testing have reported nosebleeds due to the extreme temperature fluctuations of the blankets surface as well as feeling mild frostbite due to shock caused by touching its surface while wearing bare skin.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 161-1:</strong> On 1/29/2010, SCP-161 was moved to Site-19 for testing on the possibility of removing its anomalous properties. The object was brought into a containment chamber and placed on the floor of a 5x5x5m room with a temperature of -15° C. Within one hour, SCP-161 had burrowed under a layer of snow and began moving across the floor in an attempt to find warm ground and coverings. Two hours after initial placement, SCP-161 ceased movement and telemetered a signal that was picked up by Foundation personnel in the area.']</p>
