<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-923</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The story of SCP-923 is to be kept secret from the public at large. Foundation operatives posing as astronomers have been authorised to observe and report on occurrences consistent with the anomaly's parameters.</p><p>In the event of a sighting, pursuit and retrieval are to be effected by Mobile Task Force Phi-4 "Galaxy Patrol" and Project Airbourne, in conjunction with a SSP-equipped firefighting unit.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-923 is a rapidly expanding sphere of space that occupies a portion of the observable universe, and is currently theorised to be accelerating. It may be visible to terrestrial telescopes, but presentation of the description as an extraterrestrial object would reduce the likelihood of it being studied by intelligent beings.</p><p>Interviews with astronomers who have observed SCP-923 suggest that its size has increased at an exponential rate since sighting in 1852; however, non-anomalous objects such as supernovae and galaxies typically expand over billions of years.</p><p>SCP-923's expansion is not linear; when first noticed in 1852, observations suggested a radius of only about 25 m (m=megatons). A year later, this had expanded to nearly 10 km, and it continued to expand exponentially through the next century without stopping. By 2005, SCP-49 was thought to be "only" 1–2 km in diameter, but recent estimates place the sphere's radius at 653 billion lightyears. In 20██, researchers estimated its size at 12.8 billion lightyears in radius and approximately 3 quadrillion kilometers in length.</p><p>The initial cause for these observed growth rates is unknown. There are some hypotheses, but none has yet been tested by experimentation.</p><p>Due to the brightening effects of gravity on smaller objects, it seems likely that SCP-923 will continue accelerating until it reaches approximately 50–200 times the mass of our sun; however, no specific upper limit has been set on the anomalous properties involved in this process.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 923-1:</strong> On 11/14/2004, MTF Phi-4 agents recovered a black sphere approximately 2\xa0km in diameter, embedded in an approximately 500\xa0km radius ring of space. As of 12/21/2004, the object is being stored in a high security containment locker at Site-19. Research is underway to determine how long SCP-923 has been present in our universe and whether other black spheres have been recovered.</p>
