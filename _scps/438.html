<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-438</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-438 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-77, within the Research Wing. A light source is to be kept continuously on SCP-438 at all times; this is to be removed for testing purposes only.</p><p>All testing of SCP-438 requires written approval from both the current Head Researcher and the current Site Administrator; such approval may be granted with or without notification.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-438 is a blush pink lip gloss, of unknown brand, manufactured in Germany. The packaging features the Goldilocks logo and an image of a woman in modern dress holding the container. Analysis has revealed no chemical components other than lip gloss; the label does not list any ingredients or active components.</p><p>All instances of SCP-438 have been found to contain traces of forty different women, with their ages ranging from newborns to elderly women. Testing has shown that the identities of these women are randomly assigned; they do not appear to be significantly influenced by the makeup of the subject.</p><p>When an individual applies SCP-438 on their lips and then places their mouth close to another person's mouth, the subject will be able to speak normally and make intelligible sounds for about ten seconds. This speech is often incoherent or irrelevant, and usually appears as a string of words whose meanings could be understood by any person who knew the language being spoken.</p><p>While SCP-438 has no known effect on spoken languages other than English, it has been observed that subjects can understand and speak foreign languages fluently when using SCP-438; this effect seems to not occur when a subject is alone.</p><p>Instances of SCP-438 do not appear to be affected by normal oiling or saliva, nor are instances affected by beverages or other liquids (such as saliva or oil) unless these liquids are taken internally. In addition, both oral use and inhalation do not affect how long a subject can speak with SCP-438 worn on their lips; however, use of SCP-438 prevents taste perception while wearing it.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 438-1:</strong> Incident Report</p><p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-438 was found missing from Site-77's locker. The Foundation records indicate that two Level-2 personnel were assigned to watch this locker at all times, and that the two were responsible for all testing performed with SCP-438. The last test administered with SCP-438 was on ██/██/20██, six hours before the object disappeared. This test involved a subject speaking to a Foundation linguist with SCP-438 on their lips.</p><p>Both personnel were interviewed; the subject claimed that they had not seen SCP-438 since their last use of it the previous day, and denied any knowledge of its disappearance. Both personnel were given Class-B amnestics.</p><p>The Foundation records indicate that the identical incident occurred again on ██/██/20██, when SCP-438 was found missing from its locker again. Both personnel have been reassigned and are being monitored for any sign of anomalous activity."]</p>
