<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-566</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-566 is to be contained in a heavily guarded facility. Any civilians who approach the site are to be immediately detained and questioned.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-566 is an anomalous cloud present over a small town in ██████, California. As of 11/17/20██, SCP-566 is approximately fifteen meters high and has reached the level of a Category 3 Storm Cloud.</p><p>While SCP-566 has not yet caused any severe damage, it has been observed to cause mild discomfort to nearby populations.</p><p>SCP-566 was discovered on 11/16/20██ when a storm cell passed over the town of ██████, CA. While there were no reports of rain, droplets began falling from SCP-566. The rain intensified and a tornado formed over the town.</p><p>The tornado destroyed ██████'s local hospital and several other buildings before moving into the surrounding hills. Evidence showed that the ground had been moving underneath the structure for the duration of the event. The storm system dissipated four hours later and SCP-566 became partially visible in clear weather.</p><p>SCP-566 appeared transparent and faint save for an unidentified image visible within it at 40 meters away from the object. Both SCP-566 and this image appear blurry upon closer inspection with few details being distinguishable from either entity's surface texture.</p><p>The same image appears in a smaller scale on foggy days within 10 kilometers of SCP-566. It also appears near sunset or dawn to observers living at distances between 5 and 15 kilometers from SCP-566's location.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
