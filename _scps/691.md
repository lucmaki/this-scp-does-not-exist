<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-691</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-691 are to be contained and contained separately in custom-constructed containment cells with matching dimensions. These cells are to be embedded in a wall of solid concrete.</p><p>While surveillance equipment is included in each cell, the devices are not to be repaired or recalibrated. Through means still unknown it appears that SCP-691's ability to manifest outside of its containment does not function when used in conjunction with this monitoring system. Once a manifested instance of SCP-691 has been re-contained, the surveillance system is to be deactivated and the cameras destroyed. The walls of both containment cells must be lined with lead shielding so that SCP-691 cannot utilize any light sources on the outside. The outdoors portions of these cells will be enclosed just as the indoors portions are to prevent any contaminated particles from escaping their confines. Any suspected breach of containment must be reported immediately to Dr. Lancaster or Dr. Shaw by Level 1 personnel only.</p><p>Any non-Foundation members who interacted with SCP-691 are to be amnesticized and issued Class A amnestics regardless of involvement in testing or containment breaches.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Instances of SCP-691 are similar in appearance to Bona, the largest living Cetartiodactyla (order Artiodactyla), with two exceptions: both instances of SCP-691 and their corresponding environments are composed entirely of lead, and SCP-691 also bears a branched antler atop its head composed of glass.</p><p>SCP-691 does not appear to be able to perceive its environment. While it is capable of walking around, it will always move from one corner of its cell to the next. It will only stop moving once it is adjacent to its feeding or breeding area.</p><p>After an unknown period of time (currently at least 10 hours), SCP-691 will begin manifesting outside its containment. If a Foundation surveillance system has not been activated at the time, the manifestation will take the form of an adult male Bona with 2-3 meters of height, weighing 200+ kilograms and possessing thick gray fur up to 20 centimeters in length. With the exception of coloration, this manifestation will be identical to an adult Bona.</p><p>Due to the extreme ferrous composition of both instances of SCP-691, testing on them has been extremely difficult. When attempting any tests on either entity, such as shock or radiation tests, it has proved extremely difficult to observe any effect that would allow for testing afterwards. When testing revealed that both instances were unaffected by all known forms of radiation, including most forms of radiation related to matter existing outside a solid mass, and especially manifested in phase 1 testing (see below), Dr. Shaw theorized that either all instances are able to resist matter existing outside their own seemingly infinitely large contained spaces which all seem to share or that there may be a fourth instance or dimension outside the containment space which can be accessed through SCP-691's intelligence or somehow combine with our own ipsilateral consciousnesses through shared thought patterns through time travel or something else we cannot yet comprehend.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Foundation testing has revealed that the manifestation of SCP-691 is a stage in its reproductive cycle. When an instance of SCP-691 is within 10 hours of being ready to breed, it will begin manifesting outside its containment. After 30 minutes or so, it will then return to its original manifestation 1) allowing for observation of the birth of the young and 2) allowing for observation of the newly born instance feeding on its mother.']</p>
