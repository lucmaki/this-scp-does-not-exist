<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4 is currently contained within a humanoid containment chamber. Its cell should be kept clean and decorated with at least one plant. A picture of its spouse must be placed in a plain white frame, ideally on top of the bed. A mirror should be placed near its cell door, so it can see itself as it sleeps.</p><p>Any communications with SCP-4 must be done through approved channels, such as television and video games. The room should contain a television set equipped with a remote control, and two video games (Candy Crush Saga and Where's My Water?) should be available for play.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4 is a male humanoid with Caucasian features. It stands 2.5 meters tall and weighs 100 kilograms, and has humanistic arms but a humanoid torso and legs. The skin of its head, neck, shoulders, chest, abdomen, and thighs are grayish-white in coloration.</p><p>SCP-4 has two major anomalous capabilities:</p><p>SCP-4 also shows the ability to turn invisible at will; however, it can only disappear from its sight. SCP-4 will occasionally reappear in an adjacent location in the same room as its spouse if they happen to be looking directly at it. SCP-4 will appear unharmed when it reappears.</p><p>SCP-4 was originally discovered during an investigation into a rash of disappearances in ████████, ██████████. The house was purchased by a couple who later disappeared without a trace. Their home was opened up to the press and subsequently burned down in the incident that later became known as "The ███████ Incident". After no leads on the whereabouts of either SCP-4 or its owners were found, it was classified as Keter.</p><p>When SCP-4 disappears from its sight (smaller distances will result in less obvious loss of time), SCP-4's spouse becomes profoundly distressed for approximately 20 hours after its disappearance before resuming typical behavior. This distress increases each time SCP-4 disappears, until it causes an actual breakdown and suicide attempts. It is currently unclear how long this effect can last, although nonvivisection testing suggests that it may become permanent if continued indefinitely.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-4 was discovered in a house in ██████, ██████. The house was purchased by a couple who disappeared after moving into it. The cause of their disappearance was initially attributed to cannibalism, but it was later discovered that they had been removed from the house after being converted into SCP-4 and SCP-5. A note was found in the front yard that read "We can\'t go on like this."']</p>
