<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-334</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-334 is to be contained within a high-voltage containment cell, surrounded by an electromagnetic field. This containment cell is to be guarded by at least one (1) security officer while in containment. The area containing SCP-334 must be made aware of its existence and properties. Any civilian reports of SCP-334 should be deemed non-anomalous and ignored.</p><p>SCP-334's effects trigger only when it is approached by a sentient organism. To that end, the Foundation has established a covert team to track SCP-334's movements, and to attempt to determine the location of SCP-334 whenever possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-334 is a humanoid entity of human proportions, resembling an adult male. SCP-334 is believed to be non-anomalous, but the exact method of its creation is unknown.</p><p>SCP-334's anomalous properties activate when it is approached by a living sentient organism (and will not activate once it leaves the vicinity of this individual). Once activated, SCP-334's anomalous property causes all electromagnetic devices within a 400 m radius to behave erratically and/or malfunction, often causing severe damage to both electronic devices and structures.</p><p>The effect does not extend beyond the area created by SCP-334's influence; for instance, if a building were constructed using electromagnetic construction materials the effect would have no effect on that building. As such, the effects of SCP-334 are limited due to the distance required in order to activate it.</p><p>SCP-334 appears to show no interest or desire in drawing attention to itself; however, attempts at capturing and containing it have met with failure.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-334 was observed in the city of ██████, California. During this time, SCP-334 was seen to enter a building and remove a large object. The object was recovered and identified as a black cash register, which has been recovered with no anomalous properties (aside from possible further experimentation).</p><p>When questioned by Foundation operatives, SCP-334 claimed that he was "removing evil energy", and that "it had been bothering him". SCP-334 refused to explain how he had performed this task.']</p>
