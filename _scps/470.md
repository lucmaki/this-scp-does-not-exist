<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-470</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Currently all known instances of SCP-470 are contained in an underground facility owned and operated by the Foundation. A network of Foundation agents operate at all times to locate, monitor and terminate excursions into the civilian world. The entrance to this facility is located at Site 9-██ in ██████, Alabama.</p><p>Baseline containment protocols are to be followed at all times when dealing with SCP-470-1.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-470 is a gelatinous mass of approximately 1 cm in diameter and 3.2 cm long. It has been identified as a species of the genus Protula known for the non-anomalous behavior exhibited by its members. SCP-470 bears no morphological features which would suggest an anomalous nature, and so retains the designation of Euclid.</p><p>When an excursion into the civilian world (defined as exit through a point within 50 meters of a surface) occurs, SCP-470 becomes active. When in this state, it will attempt to enter the nearest human body (or any other entity with blood running through its veins). As long as it remains within such a body, SCP-470 will receive oxygen from that body's veins and organs, and expel waste products periodically. This process is referred to as excretion and is the main anomalous characteristic of SCP-470.</p><p>If an excursion through the civilian world extends beyond the depth of 50 meters, then SCP-470 will expel itself bodily out of its host body in order to return to [DATA EXPUNGED]. This process is harmless to both SCP-470 and its host body. SCP-470 will not respond to human attempts to retrieve it, but typically placates such attempts by emitting sounds suggestive of laughter.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 470-A:</strong> SCP-470 was originally identified in [DATA EXPUNGED] in the late 19th century. The city's mayor was a collector of various curiosities, and had acquired an unidentified instance of SCP-470. He subsequently sold it to the Foundation for 5,000 USD in 1901."]</p>
