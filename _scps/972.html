<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-972</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-972 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-79. The locker is to be monitored by a closed-circuit camera, and the area is to be checked every hour on the hour. Any unauthorized personnel who enter the room are to be detained, amnesticized, and released.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-972 is a plastic bag of the type commonly used to store food at a public picnic. The contents of the bag are unremarkable, save for the presence of a large quantity of lint in the bottom. SCP-972 spontaneously generates lint when any person who has not been exposed to lint (i.e., all non-anomalous humans) comes within it.</p><p>SCP-972-1 is a human male that emerged from SCP-972 on ██/██/199█, shortly before [DATA EXPUNGED]. As such, the identity of SCP-972-1 is currently unknown.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 972-1:</strong> SCP-972 was discovered by Agent ████, who was sent to photograph a picnic. Upon obtaining SCP-972, he reported that he could see a human male (SCP-972-1) inside the bag. After ordering several security personnel to open the door and bring the subject out, SCP-972-1 stared at the camera for several seconds before disappearing.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Several individuals have stated that they had seen and heard "something" in the bag before the contents were removed and amnesticized. However, none of these individuals could identify what it was they had seen.']</p>
