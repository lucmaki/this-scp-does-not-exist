<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-554</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-554 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment locker at Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-554 is a motion-sensing video game console bearing the markings "Taito Enterprises, Ltd." located in New York City.</p><p>SCP-554 is capable of producing a non-anomalous console warp effect when a disc is inserted into its slot. Inserting a disc into SCP-554 causes its internal software to automatically boot up and render a completely non-anomalous graphical background on its primary display.</p><p>SCP-554 is currently programmed to run the same version of █████ █████████'s sci-fi shooter game "Avatar".</p><p>The player controls the Avatar, an extraterrestrial humanoid armed with lasers, weaponry and an assault rifle (all of which are selectable by the player). The Avatar can be equipped with multiple weapons and accessories, including [REDACTED] which possess no anomalous properties.</p><p>Throughout gameplay, SCP-554 will occasionally display augmented reality imagery projected through special projection screens located within the console's holographic projectors. The imagery consists of static images depicting various locations within the game world, as well as brief animations portraying battle sequences and dialogue exchanges between non-anomalous entities.</p><p>When a disc is inserted into SCP-554 and boots up to its first level, the background will change from its pre-set graphical depiction to an image of [REDACTED], presumably a human female (See Addendum 554-1). However, at this time the background image is rendered in shades of red and appears distorted with markings resembling bloodstains. The female avatar then disappears into thin air moments before the background begins to undergo significant alterations; these changes rapidly reduce the size of the image until it becomes indistinguishable from one produced by a human subject viewing this region of space through advanced technology.</p><p>Immediately following this sudden appearance of [REDACTED], an explosion will occur in front of the screen; this explosion will only occur if that area of space has been previously viewed by a human subject during gameplay. After approximately [REDACTED] after gameplay has ceased, several entities resembling humanoid avatars will appear out of nowhere (See Addendum 554-2 for details) and engage the discarded weapon(s) possessed by the avatar; this process continues until all ammunition has been depleted or upon reaching either scenario described above (see Addendum 554-3 for details). During combat scenarios involving multiple enemies, ammunition cannot be replenished until combat ceases.</p>
