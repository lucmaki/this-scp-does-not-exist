<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-305</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-305 is currently uncontained due to the lack of any viable method of containment. The Foundation has taken the unusual step of denying reports of SCP-305's existence by media outlets in order to prevent confusion with other incidents.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The exact nature of SCP-305 is currently unknown.</p><p>The location at which SCP-305 manifests is an independently owned Waffle House restaurant located in the state of Georgia, United States. When a subject attempts to enter the location, they will witness barstools being overturned by an unidentified form of force and large quantities of food being thrown out of the establishment. At this point, no cell phones appear inside the establishment to record any footage for later broadcast.</p><p>Upon exiting the establishment, witnesses will report a crowd of bystanders waiting outside the building. The witnesses will invariably deny that there was a disturbance at all until asked about it by security personnel.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 305B:</strong> The Foundation has been unable to determine the nature of SCP-305. There are no recorded instances of SCP-305 manifesting before 1976, despite the fact that the Waffle House concept was established in 1955. Security footage from the restaurant\'s website shows no disturbances outside of normal business hours.</p><p>A video of SCP-305 was uploaded to YouTube on 03/02/2012. Below is the transcript for the video.</p><p>The video shows an unknown man wearing a black mask and brandishing a large meat cleaver and several knives entering the restaurant. The man is subsequently confronted by two staff members. The man removes his mask and identifies himself as "The Butcher." The staff members attempt to restrain him, but The Butcher breaks free and proceeds to slice up one of the staff members with a variety of knives.</p><p>The video cuts to a view of an empty Waffle House kitchen. The footage then cuts back to show The Butcher standing over the body of one of the staff members while holding a cleaver and several knives in each hand.</p><p>The footage then resumes, showing The Butcher making his way out of the kitchen and into the main dining area, where he proceeds to overturn tables and throw food around the establishment before exiting.</p><p>The video ends after approximately 19 minutes.</p><p>Video Transcript (click to play):</p><p>I know you can see me, but I\'m gonna make this quick. I got a bunch of people outside that I want you to pay attention to.</p><p>First off, there\'s your boss, he\'s been giving me some trouble lately. He\'s got some big ideas about expansion, but I don\'t think he realizes how far we\'ve come. That\'s what I like about my job, you can build something from nothing.</p><p>Oh yeah, it looks like I\'ve made some friends here too. What do you say we take them out? How about a nice big lake of hot grease? Or maybe this place gets burned down? That would be a sight to see!</p><p>You know what you need? A little bit of excitement! You\'ve been settling down too much lately, I can\'t have that! You need someone who will make you question yourself, who will make you fight for your right to live! That\'s why I\'m here! You\'re going to need a few new employees!</p><p>You\'re going to need me now more than ever.</p><p>After reviewing SCP-305-1 through -11, it appears that all instances are connected by their respective roles as antagonists or victims in other SCP-305 incidents.']</p>
