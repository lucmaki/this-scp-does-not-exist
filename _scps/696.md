<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-696</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-696 is to be kept in a sealed transparent container at all times, with a remote check of its weight on a weekly basis.</p><p>In the event that SCP-696 loses more than 3% of its mass over the course of 4 weeks, it is to be immediately weighed and the amount determined as sufficient for another week's consumption; if this is not done, or if it again loses more than 3% over the course of 5 weeks, then it is to be treated as a Euclid object, and Class-A amnestics administered. Interviews may be conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-696 is a package of animal food, which retains its apparent size and shape, even when weighed. It appears to be composed entirely of cat food. When opened, it anesthetizes the subject instantly upon contact with their tongue, and the subject appears to be unable to resist eating the food in this state.</p><p>SCP-696 is completely self-contained in its packaging. There are no traces of anything else inside or outside of it.</p><p>When eaten, this effect lasts for 2 hours. The subject's saliva will stain yellow while they are affected by SCP-696, but normal rationing can be used until this time expires. There do not seem to be any ill effects caused by SCP-696, such as intoxication or increased aggression; however, there is always a 2 hour time limit after consumption before the subject's teeth stop moving without stimulation. On rare occasions, one or more of the subject's teeth may break off while this effect is in effect.</p><p>If SCP-696 is opened while affected by this effect, the subject will immediately begin munching on the rest of it and show no signs of being aware of it until after its effects pass. Testing has shown that if a portion of it is taste-tested (by pressing gauze over their lips when no longer munching), the entire item still has a flavor similar to "cat food."</p><p>The effects produced from consuming items from SCP-696 (such as activation of special teeth) appear to only occur when consumed within the 48 hours prior to their activation.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum-1:</strong> SCP-696 was recovered from a building in █████████, ██████, after reports of a cat knocking over a number of empty food containers. Tests on the food indicate that it is still edible. The package's label had been partially erased."]</p>
