<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-916</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-916 and SCP-816 are contained within a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-██. In the event that 32 Ceti A passes through the solar system, Foundation amnestics will be disseminated to SCP-916's immediate family members. SCP-916 is to be fed one (1) non-anomalous energy bar (in accordance with dietary recommendations for data storage) every twelve (12) hours.</p><p>In the event that 2,016 event days pass since the previous SCP-916 containment breach, the following amnestic will be administered: "You have been granted a pass from your normal life and allowed to do whatever it is you enjoy doing so much. Please take some time to explore your new circumstances." This pass should not be revoked under any circumstances until 2,016 days have passed.</p><p>After this point, viewing SCP-916's containment cell as "normal" will result in no adverse effects on behavior or memory. However, viewing SCP-916 as "abnormal" during this period will result in psychological distress at levels consistent with the observation of its current anomaly. Outside observers are encouraged to observe a fake version whenever they deem necessary. All attempts to locate and contain SCP-816 have failed, and Foundation surveillance has reported no signs of the object since ██/██/19██. Therefore, priority number one is neutralization of SCP-816 on a permanent basis; priority number two is neutralization of SCP-916.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-916 is a 170 cm long (63 in) humanoid male similar to an African Masai, with an unknown level of genetic manipulation and anomalous physiology.</p><p>SCP-916's skin is composed entirely of two (2) layers of various material: the outer layer is formed from thin carbon nanotubes and diamond dust, while the inner layer is comprised of bismuth and aluminum; both layers conduct electricity perfectly. Further investigation has indicated that SCP-916's entire skin is subjectively the "thinnest" it can feel.</p><p>SCP-916 possesses a complex network of nerves, muscles and fibers within its body, allowing it to control and manipulate its body in ways not possible for a human being. SCP-916's internal biochemistry produces a number of neurochemicals which are largely impossible to measure or replicate in an artificial setting. The overall effect of these neurochemicals is to make all sensory inputs on SCP-916 highly pleasurable, regardless of the actual stimuli. Due to this, the penalty for ignoring or violating the advice given by SCP-916, such as eating non-anomalous foods, is invariably severe injury or death. Therefore, despite no significant differences between observed behavior and that of a typical human being, there are nevertheless significant differences nonetheless.</p><p>While memory retention for events before June 20██ appears to be unaltered by any current anomaly, it appears that SCP-916 cannot be counted upon to retain long periods of time before [DATA EXPUNGED]. However, outside observers are advised against attempting to memorize specific information about oneself prior to this date unless it is convenient for performing a given task.</p><p>The following is a list of observations performed by Foundation personnel when interacting with SCP-916 prior to June 20██:</p><p>Commentary: Practically impossible. One day I'm going to need half the medical technology we have at our disposal just so I can eat and breathe properly!</p><p>SCP-916 seems more than happy with me not looking at it too much. It's dimples always get me smiling whenever it winks at me.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-916\'s name was originally "Younger Brother". After June 20██, it is referred to as "Little Brother".']</p>
