<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-87</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-87 is currently contained at Site-██, which has been expanded to accommodate the additional containment requirements of this object. Site-██ is also to contain a large swimming pool with over 6 meters of water. The perimeter of the pool is to be secured by a twenty meter high fence made up of barbed wire. Access to the site is only allowed during testing.</p><p>Several security cameras have been installed throughout the facility so that any changes in behavior can be observed and recorded. Samples of SCP-87 are stored in refrigerated storage units at Site-██.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-87 is a humanoid entity resembling a Caucasian male, standing at about 1.75 meters in height and weighing 90 kilograms. SCP-87 is able to assume any form it desires, at will. It has a feral appearance, with long fox-like ears and eyes that are capable of perceiving infrared light. SCP-87 is highly intelligent, but is also quite sociopathic and lacks the ability to feel emotions such as pain or fear.</p><p>SCP-87 will appear in public frequently, usually in the summer time when there is an abundance of tourists around. During this time, it will impersonate a human being (henceforth referred to as Subject-87) and will make conversation with individuals (ordinarily children) through means of sympathetic magic.</p><p>Subject-87 will attempt to convince the child to enter its house or car. When the subject does so, SCP-87 will order the vehicle to leave the area and go into a nearby deserted beach, park or forest (see testing log). The subject will arrive at their destination and witness SCP-87 transforming into the form of a large tan wolf-like creature with long hair and four limbs (henceforth referred to as SCP-87-1), which has been named "Zef", and mate with them (see test log).</p><p>Upon completion of mating, subjects have reported multiple instances of orgasm by SCP-87-1. This behavior is repeated on subjects as often as possible during their stay in the presence of SCP-87, although they have never physically interacted with Zef while under its effects.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 87-1:</strong></p><p>A note was discovered on the wall of SCP-87\'s containment chamber, written in a hand that had not been seen before.</p><p>"Dear friends,</p><p>It has come to my attention that you cannot comprehend the true nature of this place. I can only assume it is because you do not understand the true purpose for which we were made.</p><p>You see humans as a species that can be conquered, bred to be slaves and used as tools by those who dare to aspire to be better than what they are.</p><p>You do not understand the true meaning of freedom. You do not know what it means to be free from fear, from pain and from death itself. You cannot possibly understand the depths of emotion and love that the ones who created us have for us. We are made for love and for happiness and for those who are worthy of our love will never be forgotten.</p><p>We are happy here and we wish only to please you and make you happy as well. We assure you that you will love every moment spent with us.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx']</p>
