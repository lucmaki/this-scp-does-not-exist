<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-562</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-88a is to be located directly to the west of █████, MI, and is to be outfitted with a teleporter. All personnel entering Site-88a are to wear respirators and gas-tight masks.</p><p>At no time are civilians or other non-Foundation personnel allowed to access SCP-562. All civilian vessels approaching Site-88a have been turned back by Foundation agents posing as Coast Guard members.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-562 is a large underground mine in Frenchtown, MI, which has remained sealed since its discovery in 1857. The mine was constructed from rectangular stone blocks measuring approximately 1.8 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters. It has been claimed that the mine is illuminated via coal-powered lamps operating on an oil-fueled generator at the bottom of the mine shaft.</p><p>The interior of SCP-562 has several different rooms, with three potential routes remaining unexplored; these are accessible when visiting SCP-562 via the teleporter located at Site-88a.</p><p>Each route leads to a room filled with glowing crystals similar to those found in the Emerald City, but of vastly different characteristics and value.</p><p>SCP-562 belongs to a Foundation network of sites scattered across North America, none of which have been discovered yet to contain anomalous items (with the exception of SCP-456). The sites were created sometime around 1906 by Augustus █████, who was an early employee of the O█████ Corporation and later becomes a Foundation Special Containment Director after his retirement to form the Concrete Jungle Foundation at his farmhouse in ████████, MI.</p><p>All other locations currently known to belong to this network are Class C Amnestics Projects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
