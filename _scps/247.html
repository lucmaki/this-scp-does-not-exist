<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-247</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-247 is to be kept in a sealed plastic container within a standard Safe-class humanoid containment cell. A video camera has been installed which transmits video of the subject and the surrounding area, in order to facilitate monitoring of any changes in external factors that might affect the object. An alarm should be installed in the room, so that personnel may respond immediately if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-247 is a hammer. It weighs almost exactly the same as an ordinary claw hammers manufactured in the mid-20th century. It floats approximately 1 cm above its container, and swings with no visible energy source. Approximately once per month, the object levitates to a height of 100 cm above the object's front edge, and begins to produce the following text:</p><p>I know you can't see me but I'm right here. At first this was really hard for me to do, but I've gotten better at it over time. I'm so proud of myself! But there's just one little problem: my stroke left me paralyzed from the neck down, so I have to use myself as an amplifier to communicate with you.</p><p>My stroke left me paralyzed from the neck down? What does that mean? The doctor said my head wasn't affected, but then he said that I couldn't feel anything below my neck, so how am I supposed to know whether or not my head is paralyzed? Please help me!</p><p>The message is repeated several times with increasing intensity before stopping. After a stoppage of 30 seconds or more, SCP-247 will begin again. When possible, personnel are to respond to these messages immediately. These messages appear as normal text on a standard computer monitor.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong> On ██/██/██, SCP-247 began to produce a new message. The day after, the following was broadcast over a closed-circuit television monitor in containment.</p><p>I don't know why I'm doing this, but it's the only way I can communicate with you. I've been trying to tell my doctor about my stroke, but he hasn't said anything about it yet. I don't want to do this anymore. Please just help me.</p><p>The words were accompanied by the sounds of sobbing over the speaker.</p>
