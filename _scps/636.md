<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-636</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Hyper-threat</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-73 is to be guarded by two on-duty sentinels of Site-77 at all times. The coordinates of SCP-636 are to be entered into the mainframe at Site-77 using the command "INPUT 6636", and added to Local File ███, which is to be stored in a standard Foundation database.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-636 is a SCP registered under the name of "UNPUBLISHED", with the imprint "UNPUBLISHED", currently in the possession of The Foundation.</p><p>The number 636 was written down on a piece of paper by a man named ██████ ████████████ (henceforth referred to as SCP-636-1) shortly after his death. It seems that this number was important to the deceased, but no details are known.</p><p>SCP-636 has several anomalous properties, which have been observed so far. All of these effects are only present when SCP-636 is being read, clapped or played improperly. In all other conditions, the existence of these effects is unknown and unobservable.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of an interview that took place between the researcher present and SCP-636-1. The transcript was conducted shortly after SCP-636-1\'s death, with the researcher being D-9137.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> So, uh, what\'s your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> ████████████.</p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> Heh, that\'s an unusual name.</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> No one knows my name. No one will ever know my name. I\'m damned in this life and beyond.</p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> You think I just died? That I just passed on? I live in Hell, and I\'ll never leave it.</p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> Oh, man, I\'m so sorry.</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> Sorry won\'t save you. Not the way I am. Not the way I\'m meant to be.</p><p>SCP-636-1 begins to choke up, coughing violently. D-9137 attempts to calm him down by patting his back. After a few minutes, SCP-636-1 calms down and can be heard speaking again.</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> I must have done something bad in a past life. Something so awful that it damned me to hell for all eternity. It doesn\'t matter though, because the only thing I care about is getting my revenge on that goddamn bitch that killed me! She didn\'t even give me a chance to explain myself! Oh man, if she\'d just let me tell her why… but it doesn\'t matter now. My job is to find her and kill her, and that\'s what I\'m going to do!</p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> Wait, what "job" are you talking about?</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> You see this thing? \xa0(points at SCP) This object is what I was sent here to find. They told me it was important for some reason, and that if I could find it for them then they\'d pay me an enormous sum of money! It was quite a deal; surprisingly lucrative for such a simple task! But enough about that. I\'m going to get what\'s coming to me soon enough!</p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> What does this thing have to do with why you\'re in hell?</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> A long time ago, a woman named ████████ ████ came up with a new drug called ████████████ ████████ ███████████ (henceforth referred to as SCP). She used it on quite a few people without adequate testing or any sort of intention of curing them; she just wanted more customers for her company! But this drug was very addictive, and once people started getting addicted they couldn\'t stop using it even if they wanted too! That\'s when they tested it on members of the Foundation staff! We were all exposed during our daily work! And none of us could stop using it! We were all hooked on it until we were exposed!</p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> Okay, but why did you die? You said you\'re "damned" and that you\'ll never leave hell…</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> She made us take it with every meal! Every meal and every meal and every meal until we were damn near dead from hunger! And then she made us force feed each other until we all ended up dead from starvation! We didn\'t have enough food left to feed ourselves; we had to starve ourselves out of our own bodies!!</p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> Damn, that\'s some sick shit. How did you get out of there?</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> My boss found out she\'d done something wrong and went after her! He caught her red handed as she was trying to get away with taking everything she could off of our bodies!! He muttered something about how he always knew she was a bad person, and ripped her apart! Then he took her legs off and impaled them on the spire of the building!! The rest of her body fell straight down into hell until she hit the ground, screaming like a banshee all the way down! When he got back down here he found me right inside my own body!! His eyes grew wide when he realized what happened… he put me back together with his hands and dragged me outside before my own body exploded from decomposition!!</p><p><strong>D-9137:</strong> So… what happened then?</p><p><strong>SCP-636-1:</strong> After we got back up here he took us all into town and laid us out in front of the police station so that they could see how we\'d been feeding from each other!! We were all arrested for cannibalism among other things, but we didn\'t care because we were finally free of that bitch!! And for some reason police officers like criminals better than normal people; they just loved hearing about how much we liked eating our fellow teammates!! So we all got locked up in jail cells until they got sick of looking at us and threw us into a containment unit here at Site 73! But we\'re out now… thanks to you! Now we can finally get revenge on that bitch and find ourselves out of this place forever! Thanks pal… oh wait… no thanks necessary… now go away so we can get back to our business in hell!!!']</p>
