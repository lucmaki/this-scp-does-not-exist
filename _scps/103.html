<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-103</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Item is to be kept under constant observation in a sealed safe at Site-██. Containment chamber has been constructed around item, and is fitted with two cameras, a motion detector, and a digital watch. Also included in the containment chamber are several books, appointment cards, and a diary. The motion detector is to be checked daily for unexpected activity; otherwise, the chamber may be entered only by personnel wearing digital watches or in possession of appointment cards produced after 1997. Appointment cards are issued to personnel checking the motion detector once every 2 weeks.</p><p>Item may not be removed from its containment chamber unless approved by O Command personnel. Personnel must first enter the office of Senior Research Assistant Dr. Charles L. Caran III, at Site-██, through the hidden entrance to his office in the back room. D-Class personnel are not allowed to enter this office without special authorization from O Command.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Item consists of an envelope, handwritten on each side with a hand-drawn logo and text. Formed letters: SCP-103 is the designation for this item. Item also contains a small drawing of a man wearing a lab coat facing left, and another of a kangaroo wearing glasses. Both images are surrounded by a red outline. The card's cover is written in black ink on plain white card stock; it bears no distinguishing marks or materials aside from the texture and feel of the paper, which appears to be regular printer paper.</p><p>The text currently found on both sides of the card:</p><p>Series No. 001</p><p>The items inside contain information relevant to several subjects in the Cambridge University Press (CUP) standard first edition bibliographies published between 1969 and 1972, as well as several other subjects not covered by CUP. Additionally, it contains several notes referring to specific articles found in those bibliographies. Each article is accompanied by a note stating "Please return", "Please read", or "Please share". Subjects for which information is provided include:</p><p>Details about each subject are found in the following documentation:</p><p>This documentation was available at the time of acquisition of SCP-103 by Foundation agents prior to its containment and has been kept in storage at Site-██ since then. Agent Frank ██████ returned to Site-██ with SCP-103 on 19/11/1997, after requesting Foundation assistance in locating two textbooks stolen from his apartment. He was confronted by three individuals claiming to be researchers from the National Library of Australia (NLA) and was abducted when he refused to give them information about his research project. After an extended period of investigation, Foundation agents managed to track down and capture one member of the group, who revealed that they were employed by NLA researcher Dr. Elijah ██████ and had been given access to his office on an irregular basis to work on certain projects related to the preservation of government records.</p><p>After questioning Dr. ██████ about ██████'s involvement in SCP-103, he explained that he had discovered SCP-103 during a research project on documents dated 1967/8/26 and questioned whether any further information about these documents could be found using SCP-103 as a guide and source of clues. Further information was then obtained regarding these documents regarding their original locations, references made by these documents, etc.; all related material has been transcribed into the documentation above, which includes sources as detailed as JSTOR database API calls made in 1997.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On 05/03/2011, a member of the O Command staff noticed unusual activity on the motion detector within SCP-103's containment chamber. It was discovered that the motion sensor was showing signs of constant motion. Further examination by security personnel revealed that the object was being moved around the room at regular intervals. However, no physical contact with the object was noticed; thus, it appears to be something intangible moving through the air.</p><p>Date Time Activity Notes</p><p>17/03/2011 17:00:09 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:04:31 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:07:12 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:08:30 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:10:09 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:12:55 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:16:23 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:21:27 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:23:54 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:25:45 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:28:32 No activity observed</p><p>17/03/2011 17:29:29 No activity observed</p>
