<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-446</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-446 is to be contained in a specially constructed, soundproofed room with all windows and doors blocked off. The room's temperature must be kept at a consistent level of 20 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-446 is a wooden podium 2 meters high containing an electronic device made up of a pair of speakers connected to an oscilloscope. The device is capable of emitting sounds of different frequencies, which are said to be extremely damaging to human hearing. SCP-446 was recovered from the █████ █████ College in ██████████, ██████, in 1997. SCP-446 was found on the stage during an opening ceremony for the college's drama department. It was labeled "Announcing the New Age of Science".</p><p>When activated, SCP-446 will emit noises resembling speech patterns used by humans, but with components that will cause physical harm to any listener. Human listeners will experience acute damage in their ear canals due to various conditions such as bleeding, swelling and/or disorientation. The only known way to prevent this is by removing the affected ears or otherwise shielding them from external stimuli.</p><p>The physical effects generated by SCP-446 were first recorded audio logs collected by Dr. ███████ in 1997. These were followed by experiments conducted with D-Class personnel in order to determine the exact structure and properties of the effect. The following is a list of information gathered from the audio logs and experiments:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
