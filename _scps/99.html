<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-99</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No special containment procedures are required for SCP-99. All information regarding SCP-99 should be obtained from the Foundation website.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-99 is a website that allows users to design their own ██████-class supertankers. Anyone who submits an SCP-99 design will be granted access to the facilities and personnel of ECODESIGN, LLC to assist in the creation of said design.</p><p>SCP-99 was originally registered by Charles P. Popp (also known as "ECODESIGN") as a US trademark on January 2nd, 2008. A company was registered under ECODESIGN's name with no additional connections. Testing has revealed that ECODESIGN's location matches that of a large office building owned by Deutsche Bank in Berlin, Germany. It is not clear why Popp chose this location for his business; however, the German Government requires businesses to have a place of residence within their country in order to maintain tax revenue.</p><p>SCP-99 will display a logo with an object resembling a very large tank and write "Welcome Because You Can" in white text on its main page. After this message has been displayed, it will disappear and be replaced by information regarding SCP-99's event system and a list of events that are currently available for design. Events seem to come about at random; however, all events show dates approximately two years away from present day. On additional pages accessed via the search box, it is revealed that these events center around tankers of the ██████ class carrying oil or other products through marine environments such as the Arctic Ocean. Users can sign up in order to create one such tanker using any combination of parts from the current set: hull, propulsion units, crew quarters and cargo hold(s). Items can be combined from more than one event; however, each part must be listed separately due to different lengths for each part of the plot.</p><p>All parts of an event must have any amount of plot possible for them; users are not allowed to combine less than four separate plot storylines into one event unless they make it eligible for multiple awards at once (for example, letting them win both Best World Product and Best Plot). Event submissions costing over 50 USD require approval from an individual from ECODESIGN before submission is accepted; further information is given in the instructions before submission. It is not known how SCP-99 selects winners; however, all winners have been contacted by SCP-99 staff after completing their apparently randomly-chosen plot storyline(s).</p><p>Users cannot edit or delete their submitted plot without permission from ECODESIGN staff.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, an altered version of SCP-99 was found on one of the Foundation\'s servers. The page was titled "SCP-99 v2" in red letters and had a logo similar to SCP-99, but with a different object. The logo in this logo is a large tank composed entirely of oil, with a hose attached to it. The words underneath the logo read "Welcome Because You Can". The page is accessible from the homepage; however, it is not possible to submit an event without first going to the "Events" tab at the top of the page.</p><p>The image on this page resembles several other images of oil tanks found on other websites such as those found on Flickr. A review has been made to determine whether or not this altered version of SCP-99 is anomalous.</p>
