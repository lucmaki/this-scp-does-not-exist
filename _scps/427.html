<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-427</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-427 is to be kept in a 5m x 3m room in Site 17, with the airlock door being obscured by a wall of standard concrete. The only exit is restricted to Level 4 personnel and above. No staff outside of Containment are to be allowed entry into the room, under any circumstances.</p><p>A camera is to be kept trained on the object at all times. Interaction with SCP-427 during testing requires two or more staff members to be present, except for testing involving high-risk materials or situations which could significantly affect the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-427 is an assemblage of two tangled masses of wires and plastic objects, with a third mass consisting of a keyboard and two translucent green lights on the frame. The object appears to be in the shape of a human being, constructed from wires and lightbulbs which hang in place as if held by wires. No matter how SCP-427 is moved or oriented, it will always appear to display a consistent gender, regardless of biological state.</p><p>Delineation is possible through the use of three sets of eyestalks positioned at various points around the body. Additionally, when SCP-427 is inactive, its framework appears to pulse with a faint purple light similar to that produced by transistors.</p><p>To test SCP-427's responses, press buttons on top left side of keyboard marked 1–0 in order. Hold X down for four seconds to turn on SCP-427's lights.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 427-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-427 was discovered in a science lab at the University of ███████████. The object's responses were identical to those observed by researchers."]</p>
