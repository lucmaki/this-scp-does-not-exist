<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-759</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-759 consists of a remote island off the coast of █████████, ██. On both sides of SCP-759 there are no accompanying mountains, oceans, or other land masses, restricting observation and limiting the ability to retrieve objects from SCP-759's surface. Instead, SCP-759 is surrounded by a 20 km deep trench undersea. A steel tower has been constructed on the ocean floor to monitor SCP-759's surface and report any changes that occur. The submerged tower has no known access point and is only accessible via underwater vehicles.</p><p>SCP-759 is to be monitored at all times for any signs of exploration by humans. This requirement extends to any fish or aquatic organism that may have shown interest in SCP-759's anomalous properties. Any aircraft or helicopter flying over the island are to be intercepted and directed away from SCP-759 if possible. When this is not possible, entities entering SCP-759's airspace should be prevented from leaving by any means necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-759 appears to be a small island located off the coast of █████████, ██. The island has no obvious access points and its topography is similar to that of any other small island in its region.</p><p>The upper surface of SCP-759 consists of a mass of clouds that rise and fall in unison with the movement of an unidentified object beneath it. It is believed that the object is SCP-759's anomalous property and that the phenomenon has been present since SCP-759 came into existence.</p><p>When any living or non-living organism comes within 4 km of SCP-759, it will disappear from view for approximately 20 minutes. The exact duration of this effect varies depending on the size and number of organisms that come within range. At the end of this time period, the object beneath SCP-759 will descend into the water and "melt" over an area measuring up to 10 km x 10 km in size. This process occurs regardless of weather conditions and is believed to be permanent unless a human crew manages to capture it on film.</p><p>This entity is believed to be extraterrestrial in origin, although there have been no confirmed sightings due to SCP-759's remote location. It has not yet been determined if the absence of any land mass surrounding SCP-759 indicates a lack of alien life or if this is simply a quirk of its own nature. The entity itself is presumed to be composed entirely of some form of energy. The cloud which surrounds it appears gray in coloration, suggesting a low level of radiation, but no measurements have ever been taken on the substance itself.</p><p>SCP-759 was discovered by Foundation agents when a Navy survey ship reported strange phenomena near its position. Agents were dispatched to investigate and when they arrived on site they found their initial estimates had been correct: near perfect coverage with no land mass visible anywhere around them. After initial contact with the island's inhabitants was made, it was decided that further investigation would be necessary until such time as additional research could be performed without compromising containment procedures.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/██, SCP-759 disappeared from view for the first time since its discovery. Researchers were not notified of this occurrence until several hours later when a Foundation drone identified a large object submerged beneath SCP-759\'s waters. At this point the island was inaccessible due to damage to the submerged tower. The object itself was not visible from the surface and was therefore not immediately recognized as an SCP-759-class anomaly.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, the object at SCP-759 made contact with the Stari Iliyushi, a civilian vessel on top of which reside several Russian scientists and government officials attempting to investigate SCP-559. The entity captured all of them in a brief but intense beam of light and impeded mission operations for several weeks until it appeared to "fall" into the sea. Subsequent reports indicate that no members of the ship\'s crew had been injured during this time, though they are believed to have been transferred to another location by either the entity or another source of energy. The ship itself has disappeared without trace.</p><p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The anomaly at SCP-759 was identified as the object seen in the above photograph. The object is composed of an unknown mixture of different forms of exotic matter, including materials which have not been observed naturally in our universe. However, due to its intense heat and very low density, it is believed that the item itself is composed of dark energy rather than conventional matter.</p><p>It is currently thought that this object is responsible for Mr. Watson\'s "fall" from the cave at SCP-559.</p><p><strong>Addendum:</strong> The object at SCP-759 was identified as the entity seen in the above photographs. Further analysis indicates that it is composed of dark energy, with a temperature of around 100\xa0K and a density of 1.0 g/cm^3. It is thought to be extremely volatile and unstable, which is why it appears to "melt" when an organism comes within 4\xa0km of the island.</p><p>SCP-759 has been observed communicating with all manner of aquatic life, including several large fish, an octopus and an unidentified crustacean. However, the only organisms capable of grasping what the island\'s inhabitants are saying are humans. Researchers believe that this may be because the beings on SCP-759 possess a highly advanced form of telepathy, or that they may be completely unaware that we exist at all.</p><p>It also has been observed to change weather conditions around SCP-759 for periods as short as fifteen minutes.</p>
