<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-32</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-32 is to be contained in a specially constructed safe, located in Site ██. The room housing SCP-32 has been constructed to minimize damage from any breach of containment. No fewer than six (6) security personnel are to be within the room at all times to prevent unauthorized access. Only two (2) researchers are permitted within the room at any one time.</p><p>Access to SCP-32 requires written authorization by a member of level 4 or higher in the Site security hierarchy, and must be restricted to testing only. Equipment necessary for testing may be removed from the room without permission, but must be returned before resuming testing. Administering amnestics to test subjects is permissible if deemed necessary by supervisors.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-32 is a large, spherical container, constructed of a durable plastic material and measuring approximately 1 meter in diameter. A hose to pump a liquid through the interior is connected to an input port located on the top of the sphere. The interior contains three (3) mechanisms of unknown origin, which when manipulated in some way produce a flavored liquid.</p><p>The liquid produced by SCP-32 has a consistent taste and odor that researchers have determined to be similar to that of caramels.</p><p>SCP-32 was recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED] in ██████ County, Missouri, after a report of two men leaving the scene by fast vehicle was received. Foundation agents were sent in as backup and contacted local authorities for assistance. The bodies of one man and one woman were discovered nearby, both manifesting no unusual injuries or effects from being submerged in the liquid produced by SCP-32. Their identification was confirmed by dental records. Investigation has revealed that both individuals were former customers of the establishment where SCP-32 was recovered. The bodies were then returned to their families for burial.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 1:</strong> Incident 32-A</p><p>On ██/██/████, while observing testing, Dr. ██████ observed that some of the liquid produced by SCP-32 was rising out of the input port and floating towards the ceiling. The liquid melted through several layers of ceiling tiles before being sucked up into the air conditioning system above. Dr. ██████ brought the issue to the attention of his supervisor, Dr. █████, who ordered that further testing be discontinued until the issue could be investigated.</p><p>The following incident was recorded on ██/██/████:</p><p>Testing resumed at approximately 10:00 AM on ██/██/████. Dr. █████ observed that after the input port was filled with liquid, a small amount began to leak out of the bottom of the sphere and drip down onto the floor. Dr. █████ hypothesized that it was escaping from the base of the sphere. Several minutes passed without any change in the situation, and Dr. █████'s attention was drawn to an anomaly in the flashing lights on the side of SCP-32, which he noted were blinking rapidly in succession.</p><p>Dr. █████ called for a halt to testing, and then proceeded to open SCP-32's top. A liquid poured out of SCP-32, but it did not appear to be anomalous in any way. He removed a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the liquid off of it, which appeared to be clean water. The liquid continued to pour out of SCP-32's top until it was completely empty.</p><p>After testing resumed at 12:15 PM, Dr. █████ noticed that the flashing light on SCP-32 had ceased blinking while they were still in the room, and had not resumed since then either. He also noticed that the liquid was now producing a sound similar to pouring water from a pitcher.</p><p>At approximately 2:00 PM, a loud pop was heard from inside SCP-32. Upon opening SCP-32's top again, four (4) men wearing hazmat suits entered the room through the entrance on its bottom. They stated that they were there to investigate an environmental hazard, and then left without further comment. After they left, several more hazmat-suited individuals entered through both doors and closed them behind them before heading upstairs where they remained for approximately 30 minutes before leaving again as well. Strictly speaking this is not an instance of breach of containment as it only involved personnel who were already present within Site ██ at the time of entry; however it is considered an unusual circumstance and requires additional investigation."]</p>
