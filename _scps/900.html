<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-900</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-900 is currently contained within Site-19's Chemical Containment Vault. Foundation agents are to monitor all pharmaceutical firms in the United States for the production of mixtures containing phenylpropranolol. Agents are to gather references from these firms that indicate the composition and quantity of phenotropiline and methopropamine. When these compounds are combined, affected individuals are to be administered Class-A amnestics by on-site facilities and detained at a nearby Foundation site. The entire process is to take no more than one hour.</p><p>Recovery: SCP-900 was originally recovered by Foundation intelligence agents in June of 1978 following an incident involving a chemical plant in Southhampton, England. Tests on the property indicated that an unstable chemical called "6-alpha-[methoxypheny] -2-(diphenylphosphoryl) hexan-1-one" (designated SCP-900) was present. Shortly following this discovery, several civilians in the vicinity began complaining of severe heart palpitations and dizziness. By the time the Foundation took custody, three had died and six were in critical condition; casualties included several police officers and emergency responders. Testing revealed that both phenotropiline and methopropamine (designated SCP-790) were responsible for the properties noted above.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-900 is a pale yellow, odorless liquid with a viscosity of 5.3 cp at 20 degrees Celsius. The compound is extremely volatile and is known to evaporate quickly at room temperature. Analysis of the substance indicates that it contains no molecular oxygen or nitrogen.</p><p>When glassware containing SCP-900 is broken in a standard manner (with the use of non-anatomical tools), its volatile properties become more concentrated. When this occurs, the substance will instantly react with air to produce mixtures containing phenylpropranolol and methopropamine (designated SCP-790).1-4 If a complex mixture is formed containing over 16% phenotropiline or methopropamine respectively, no observable effects will occur until after one hour has passed. In this case, both compounds will reach 100% by volume within seven minutes (phenotropiline) or less than 30 seconds (methopropamine) after being released into the air.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> In the event that a saturated mixture of phenotropiline and methopropamine are broken, such as during an explosion, the mixture will spontaneously react with the air to produce mixtures containing phenylpropranolol and methopropamine. These mixtures will reach 100% by volume within five minutes after being released into the air.</p>
