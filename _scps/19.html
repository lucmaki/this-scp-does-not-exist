<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-19</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-19 is kept inside a soundproofed room at Site-77. No lights, equipment, or personnel are to be turned on except through use of approved testing keys. Under no circumstances are personnel allowed to remove from SCP-19's containment room any strips of paper bearing the phrase "She wants the moon." Any such items found outside the containment room must be destroyed.</p><p>Anyone who has accessed an SCP-19 test area is to be interviewed. Interviews should focus on the effect that SCP-19 has on them, and whether they are ready to vocalize it in writing. Redaction of this information has not been attempted so far, due to the lack of knowledge of how much to redact. All interviews must be recorded by at least two (2) interviewers, and all recordings are to be stored in secure locations.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-19 appears to be a blue box with a white label on its lid. The label reads "She wants the moon~". When left alone for ten (10) minutes, it will begin to speak in a tall reedy voice. At this point, all personnel should leave the room and not return; until the test ends, no one can enter. It has been noted that SCP-19 will speak louder if more people are present, with some sources claiming it can be heard through doors and walls.</p><p>In fifteen minutes of speaking, SCP-19 will state that it is a moon bound girl (referred to as 'the figure') and demand to "see the moon." It can only repeat these three phrases. The effect of the item wears off after thirty minutes; after four hours, all effects will disappear, and the item will release some form of ectoplasmic vapor through its lid, which resembles mist made of cotton candy floating towards a nearby open window or outside into the air. This event must be recorded by at least two (2) staff members, who must then remove their clothing before entering the containment room.</p><p>If an individual does not view SCP-19's requested item, it will become highly agitated and scream for fifteen to twenty minutes, then cease all functions and wait for another nineteen minutes before repeating this process again. Currently no known way exists to make SCP-19 do anything other than remain quiet; testing shows that it will only respond to verbal commands (also described below).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 19-1:</strong></p><p>Due to the lack of any known way to prevent it, no one who has viewed SCP-19 is allowed to write anything down. It has been noted that, if they do not see the requested item, SCP-19 will become agitated, scream loudly for forty-five minutes and then set back up to repeat the process. No other effects have been observed.</p>
