<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-7 is to be contained in an 8 x 10 m cage. A standard diet and mineral supplement are to be provided daily; exercise may be conducted once a month, with approval of Level 2 personnel. Standard cleaning protocols are applicable, with the exception of "Bedsheets". Bedsheets are not to remain on SCP-7 for extended periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7 is a male adult polar bear (Ursus maritimus), about 50 kg in weight, bearing white fur. The Polar bear was originally captured by the Foundation on ██/██/19██ from the █████████████ Barren Lands of [REDACTED] using a remote aircraft.</p><p>When confined, SCP-7 displays no abnormal behaviour, reacting normally to any stimulus presented. However, when free in its enclosure, SCP-7 will attempt to "escape" its cage. Upon being subdued, SCP-7 will take up a specific pose: with his back against the wall of his enclosure and a ventilated cloth "collar" placed over his head, resembling a swaddling infant. Due to this pose, SCP-7 is given the designation "SCP-7's Boyhood".</p><p>When placed in this position for more than 5 minutes at a time, SCP-7 may be charged by any nearby animal. Said animals have been found to be member of the Canidae family. A state of partial hypothermia has been noted after approximately 45 minutes of contact with non-Canidae animals; this effect has not been noted with other mammals.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
