<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-708</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-708 is to be kept in a refrigerated vault at Site-19. In the case of containment breach, guards must enter its chamber and place it inside a steel box. This box must then be placed in a safe zone that is approved by Site Director ████████████. No personnel are to be allowed access to SCP-708 on pain of ██ years' imprisonment.</p><p>Currently, there is struggle between O command and I command (the Foundation) over the right to make use of SCP-708's abilities. To resolve this conflict, prolonged agitation has been conducted by Agent ██████ █████████████ of O command, who argues that SCP-708 should instead be put under I command's control due to its ties to the SCP-at-large. He is to be detained upon any sign of rebellion in O command, and then executed if necessary.</p><p>In the event that O command fully succeeds in gaining control of SCP-708, instructions will be given for its use against all organized species as "a key for mankind's future." All life forms created with SCP-708's modifications are also to be classified as Keter class. (All four "I"s are required for this.)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-708 is a key made of gold, with a circular pattern of thirteen interconnected stars on the shaft. It has its original casing, but the clasp is broken off. The key's anomalous properties activate when its casing is locked, forming a Harlequin's maze if the key is then turned and locked again. When properly locked, it will not let any other individual use the key without breaking down the enclosure in front of them. This anomaly also stops all Foundation personnel from unlocking it, unless Site Director ████████████ authorizes it. The only way to break out of SCP-708's containment area is to tamper with or destroy it.</p><p>When unlocked, SCP-708 displays information in English. Occasionally this information contains information about life on other planets in our solar system, and also details about how to make life as we know it. The most important part of this data is when SCP-708 claims that if humans use its ability for their own benefit, they will have their technological capabilities increased by one hundred times in one year (or the equivalent of five hundred years under the base human lifespan). For human beings to be able to do so safely and sustainably, however, they must meet certain requirements before attempting to use SCP-708; A list follows:</p><p>Despite being able to reach a potential maximum lifetime expansion of 600 years for an average human, such an outcome is not guaranteed if these criteria are not met. Because of these risks, no attempts have been made at using SCP-708 outside of containment situations.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
