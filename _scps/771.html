<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-771</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Two men dressed in Site-██ uniforms and armed with sidearms are to be stationed in a parking lot at the edge of a fifteen kilometer perimeter surrounding SCP-771. The perimeter is to be patrolled by guards wearing standard Site-██ uniforms. No personnel are to enter the area except for members of Dirmid.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-771 is a circular enclosure approximately thirty meters in diameter. The surface of the object is covered in clear plastic, with openings for ventilation on the west and south sides. The floor of the enclosure is composed of large, grey steel sawdust which has been left exposed to the elements.</p><p>The perimeter surrounding SCP-771 is covered in large circular depressions, varying in size from five centimeters to five meters across. These depressions are filled with a thick, dark brown sludge. All soils within fifty meters of SCP-771 show a similar composition, so that it can be assumed they represent the remains of several thousand (possibly even several hundred thousand) swine.</p><p>SCP-771 was discovered by Foundation personnel during an investigation into reports of missing livestock. Numerous witnesses claimed seeing pigs leave their pens at night and enter G███████ Park, but none were ever found. A Dirmid agent shot one such witness, and although there was no trace of the animal afterward, it was determined that its death was likely caused by SCP-771's anomalous properties rather than an attack from another creature. After this incident, a team was dispatched to investigate the anomaly; upon reaching SCP-771, it was encased in Foundation property and a cover story disseminated via Site-██.</p><p>Since then, SCP-771 has continued to exist but has caused no further incidents or damage unless directly affected by other anomalous objects or phenomena.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 771.1:</strong></p><p>During the initial containment of SCP-771, a group of small, winged creatures emerged from the center of the enclosure and began attacking personnel on site. These creatures are referred to as SCP-771-2. A description is provided below.</p><p>SCP-771-2 resemble small swine in coloration and build, although they are larger than normal pigs by approximately two meters in height and weigh approximately fifteen kilograms. The creatures appear to be conscious but, due to their size and weight, cannot walk or fly. The creatures are unable to exhibit both the intelligence and physiognomy of typical animals, but their response to stimuli is similar to a human child.</p><p>The creatures respond strongly to attempts to capture them, attempting to evade capture and attack anyone who attempts to restrain them; during this period, SCP-771-2 do not react at all to outside stimuli. However, once restrained, they will become docile and passive. In one recorded case, SCP-771-2 were observed for several days before attempting to escape. At this time, instances of SCP-771-2 were observed attempting to kill a wild boar (which were found dead in the area later that evening) and dragging it into G███████ Park. After this incident, they responded only when directly addressed by personnel with a firearm or tranquilizer rifle.</p>
