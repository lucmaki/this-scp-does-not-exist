<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-641</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-641 is currently contained in a standard containment unit at Site-34 for testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-641 is an anomalous elevator located in a five story office building. SCP-641 functions normally when the elevator is not being used, but all persons who attempt to enter or exit SCP-641 will die instantly.</p><p>This does not apply to any objects that are physically attached to an instance of SCP-641 at the time of entry, as these objects will simply fall a floor and remain unharmed. If an object is physically removed from the instance of SCP-641 while it is being used, they will also die instantly.</p><p>Although this effect only occurs when entering or exiting the instance of SCP-641, attempts to activate it by otherwise pushing buttons have resulted in Level Z personnel dying instantly. Always accompanied by the sound of a door slamming shut, the corpses of Level Z personnel have shown no other physical signs of damage.</p><p>Equipment placed near an instance of SCP-641 begins to malfunction immediately after being connected.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum-641-1:</strong> Dr. ████</p><p>Dr. ████ was the primary researcher assigned to SCP-641. He entered SCP-641 on ██/██/████ at approximately 11:30 PM, and was immediately killed. Dr. ████ had previously been listed as MIA in Area-██ and was considered missing in action. The Foundation had been unable to find any information regarding his whereabouts over the course of the next eight months.</p><p>Dr. ████\'s body was discovered by a janitor after an alarm system went off in the building he was investigating. Post-mortem testing revealed no trace of injury or poison. Dr. ████ showed no signs of having been inside SCP-641 prior to its activation.</p><p>When questioned about the circumstances of his death, Dr. ████ reported that he had been trying to break into Room 641, a room containing a large safe labeled "Project G.I.G." Upon entering the room, he claimed to have found himself teleported to a different room, which contained a desk and a computer monitor displaying the word "Level Z" on it. Several pages of code were visible on the screen, which Doctor ████ claimed to have written sometime in 1991.</p><p>In a redacted interview, Dr. ████ provided a later account of his experience, at the request of Site-34\'s Commanding Officer, Agent ██████.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> I was trying to open the door, but it wouldn\'t move no matter what I did. When I turned around, there was this big safe in front of me. And when I touched it, I felt like I was being pulled into it somehow. Then everything went black for awhile. When I came to, I found myself looking at a computer monitor with some code on there that said Level Z!</p><p><strong>Agent ██████:</strong> Please describe what you saw.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> It was just one long line of text that kept scrolling by the monitor and stopping every few seconds at certain points where it would pause and say something like "Access level X". There were about 57 lines of code before it started looping back around again… until it reached the end of the file and started over again at line 1. It was all really neat stuff, really well programmed and organized too. I couldn\'t believe I\'d found something like that!</p><p><strong>Agent ██████:</strong> How did you feel?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Well, I guess surprised… but also really excited that I got to see it in action first hand! But then when the monitor started scrolling again and saying stuff like "Access level Y", "Access level Z", and "Destination unknown", my heart just dropped right into my stomach! I knew what it meant… if someone could get their hands on this stuff… they could just take over the world! So I had to get out of there as quickly as possible…</p><p><strong>Agent ██████:</strong> Did you remember anything else about this room? Was there anything else on the monitor?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> There was a little picture of a man on there that was staring back at me all weirdly from time to time… but that\'s all that stood out from what he looked like; he looked kind of like someone who might be hired for something… But anyways, then when that computer thing started scrolling again and saying stuff about access levels and destinations, I got so scared… I wanted out so bad! It was like it knew what I wanted and suddenly brought me right back here where everything started going dark again…</p><p><strong>Agent ██████:</strong> Did you remember anything else? Anything at all?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> There were two other things that stuck out in my head… but they weren\'t important enough to remember them until later…</p><p><strong>Agent ██████:</strong> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> [Long pause] Well… okay, okay, okay… [Clears throat] One thing I never forgot, is what happened when that computer thing said "Destination unknown"… It showed a picture of a man standing outside somewhere with a bunch of gravestones behind him… what kind of guy would stand outside graves? And then when it said "Destination unknown", it showed a picture of another gravestone that said "Found here". So maybe we weren\'t supposed to stop here after all… You know what maybe we should have tried exploring more thoroughly… Maybe we should have gone inside those graves before we left? Or maybe we\'d still be here if we had? [Sigh.] Maybe we\'re already dead? Or maybe we\'re already dead and didn\'t die from this accident? [Sigh.] Maybe this is hell? Maybe this is hell and we\'re already dead but aren\'t dead yet? [Couldn\'t hear any response.] Maybe this is hell and we\'re already dead but aren\'t dead yet because we\'re not dead yet? Oh God… This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! This is hell! <END LOG>']</p>
