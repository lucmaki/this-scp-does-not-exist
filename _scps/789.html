<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-789</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-789 is to be kept at each of its locations. An instance of SCP-789 is to be monitored at all times, and any interloper is to be detained under armed escort until the human subject has been located and removed from SCP-789's influence.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-789 is a tall, circular sheet of paper with the phrase "Fresh Whiff" written around its upper edge in red ink. SCP-789 is in fact composed of a stack of several sheets of paper, each differing from the others in ink color and typeface. Paper used in the creation of SCP-789 was cut from sized legal fliers originally printed to advertise local stores. All papers used in the production of SCP-789 have been recovered, but none have been recovered with the same logo on them as originally printed on SCP-789.</p><p>When an instance of SCP-789 is laid flat or otherwise placed flat against an object with a flat surface, it will cause any nearby human subject to perceive its object as smelling strongly of fresh air and/or flowers (see testing log). Subjects do not experience any ill effect other than a heightened sense that they are inhaling fresh clean air.</p><p>Objects touched by SCP-789 will always smell fresh to the point that no other odor could be detected through repeated testing. If a subject leaves an object touched by SCP-789 for 30 minutes or more while it is still being perceived as smelling strongly of flowers, during this time an identical copy of the scent will appear within the same vicinity where copies have previously appeared; this effect has never been duplicated by other methods.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
