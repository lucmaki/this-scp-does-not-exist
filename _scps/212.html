<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-212</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-212 is to be stored in a standard containment locker, which may be accessed by any D-Class personnel. The object is to be handled only by members of Site 77's research staff, who are to wear special gloves during handling.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-212 is a wooden building mason's trowel, manufactured by D. & G. Russell of London in 1818. The handle and blade combination is identical to that of standard trowels, with the exception of the object's anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-212's anomalous property manifests when an item is inserted into or removed from it, either manually or by use of any kind of mechanical device. Items inserted into SCP-212 will disappear, remaining physically absent from their original location. Removal of the item will have no effect on the anomaly at all; nothing will be missing, the item simply cannot be removed.</p><p>The only known way to prevent an item from being affected by these properties is to insert it into SCP-212 before it can be removed or changed in any way. This requires inserting an absolutely clean and reusable item into SCP-212, as the cleaning and sterilization procedures used on other materials will damage or destroy SCP-212's effects. Testing on items already contaminated by another substance has shown that they are incapable of passing through SCP-212 without harm; even creatures found to be pure antimemetic agents cannot traverse through SCP-212 without at least some degradation of their antimemetic properties.</p><p>Testing on other people has produced no results different than those seen with test subjects: items inserted into SCP-212 disappear upon removal, and neither personnel nor objects appear to retain any physical qualities which are considered abnormal.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-212\'s anomalous properties were discovered after its initial discovery in 1818. It was found in the home of a local mason in [REDACTED], who had been reported missing by his employers. Police investigation determined that Mr. Russell had died from a violent beating; his neighbors had heard him screaming as he was attacked, and evidence indicated that he was killed with a trowel.</p><p>The mason\'s daughter, Mrs. ████████, reported her father\'s disappearance to the local police upon his first absence. She was visited the next day by a representative of the Home Office, who declared that the mason\'s death was an unsolved murder case and would be treated as such.</p><p>Mrs. ████████ then contacted the Home Office and reported her father\'s disappearance to them, but was told that there was nothing they could do until his body was found. After several weeks, she returned and requested that they investigate her father\'s disappearance himself; they rejected this request on the grounds that they could not intervene in a police investigation.</p><p>A year later, the local coroners office recovered Mr. Russell\'s body from the nearby riverbank; he had been decapitated, and his body was missing its left arm, left leg and both hands. The coroner\'s report listed his fingers as "vanishings".</p><p>SCP-212 was subsequently recovered from Mrs. ████████\'s home, and is currently stored in Site 77\'s containment locker.']</p>
