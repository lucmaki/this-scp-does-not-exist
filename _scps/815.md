<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-815</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-815 is to be kept in a storage locker at Site-██. All experiments with SCP-815 are permitted under the supervision of level 4 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-815 is a small spiral notebook, completely devoted to the study of human psychology. The front cover reads, "The Complete Manual on Human Psychology. Revised and Updated Edition."</p><p>All samples within SCP-815 were written in by the original author, Dr. ██████, who has been missing since his disappearance during experimentation with SCP-███ in 1974.</p><p>SCP-815 possesses no anomalous properties before being opened, as it is quite ordinary literature in every aspect. It was discovered by ████ ████, an agent in the ███████████ agency.</p><p>Subjects that read or write in SCP-815 for at least twenty minutes experience a form of amnesia related to their own personality. For instance, subjects who write about themselves will begin writing about other characters, rather than themselves. Subjects who read about themselves will begin writing from the point of view of another character, usually a neutral one. Subjects who read about a neutral character will begin writing about a character they are familiar with; subjects who read about a familiar character will begin writing about a subject near and dear to them; subjects who read about themselves will shift their focus to another character entirely. All subjects have reported that they feel just as confident in their new writing style as they would if they had been writing it all along.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 815-01:</strong> SCP-815 was brought to the Foundation's attention when Subject D-B███ began experiencing writing impairment, and could no longer remember anything about himself. All subjects began experiencing this effect after approximately twenty minutes of filling their notebooks to capacity.", 'Addendum 815-02: Since SCP-815 can only be opened when it is empty, the Foundation has decided to keep subjects from entering the room while they are writing.</p><p><strong>Addendum 815-03:</strong> The following is an excerpt from the second page of SCP-815, which contains the original author\'s signature.</p><p>"Narcissists, sadly, are the most common personality type in human history. You\'d think they\'d have gotten better, though, wouldn\'t you? Well, that\'s where it gets complicated. Most narcissists are nothing more than a bad case of brownnosers; the only way to get real results out of them is to be subtle, and even then they pop out at you like little time bombs. Time bomb or not, though, narcissists tend to leave a personal imprint on all the lives around them."']</p>
