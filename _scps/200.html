<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-200</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-200 are to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site ██. No personnel are to have direct contact with any instance of SCP-200, and all instances should be stored in the same category of containment locker during their removal from active use. Any personnel wishing to use an SCP-200 instance for testing purposes should be sufficiently screened to avoid exposure to possible SCP-200 effects before using it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-200 is a set of brass, silver and bronze colored gears which, when in use, rotate at a uniform rate of 1.3 revolutions per second. Instances of SCP-200 are identical in appearance and design to those used in the Nexus Engine.</p><p>SCP-200 has been classified as Euclid due to its lack of anomalous properties and tendency to has no lasting effects on all who view it. When tested on human subjects, all results returned have been consistent with nonsexual usage of SCP-200.</p><p>Research into potential usage of SCP-200 is ongoing. Testing can be submitted through Level 3 Senior Researchers F███████ or A██████.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> As of ██/██/19██, all known instances of SCP-200 have been seized by the Foundation and placed in Site ██’s Containment Vault. All further testing is to be submitted through Level 3 Senior Researchers F███████ or A██████.</p>
