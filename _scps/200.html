<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-200</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-200 are to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site ██. No personnel are to have direct contact with any instance of SCP-200, and all instances should be stored in the same category of containment locker during their removal from active use. Any personnel wishing to use an SCP-200 instance for testing purposes should be sufficiently screened to avoid exposure to possible SCP-200 effects before using it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-200 is a set of brass, silver and bronze colored gears which, when in use, rotate at a uniform rate of 1.3 revolutions per second. Instances of SCP-200 are identical in appearance and design to those used in the Nexus Engine.</p><p>SCP-200 has been classified as Euclid due to its lack of anomalous properties and tendency to has no lasting effects on all who view it. When tested on human subjects, all results returned have been consistent with nonsexual usage of SCP-200.</p><p>Research into potential usage of SCP-200 is ongoing. Testing can be submitted through Level 3 Senior Researchers F███████ or A██████.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
