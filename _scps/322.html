<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-322</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> No personnel are to enter SCP-322 without the express permission of at least one Level 3 and four Level 2 members of staff. The site must be gated and guarded at all times, and any unauthorized persons entering the area are to be contained and interrogated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-322 is a cave located in the vicinity of █████, [REDACTED], SCP-322. SCP-322 was discovered after a containment breach and has since been observed to be inaccessible from its entrance.</p><p>SCP-322 is approximately 25m in length and contains an enormous, unidentified creature (designated SCP-322-1) which, when fully manifested within the cave, can be made visible through observation devices. Despite being able to touch the sides of SCP-322 at any point within its length the entity cannot be seen by any means outside of it.</p><p>SCP-322-1 appears to be a large, winged serpent with dark green scales and bright blue eyes, measuring 5m long with a 1.5m wingspan. However, the creature's true appearance remains unknown as it seems to change from time to time. The size of SCP-322-1 fluctuates between around 10 and 25 meters in length, but does not seem to have any direct relation to the size of the cave itself.</p><p>Attempts to capture or wound SCP-322-1 have resulted in failure due to the immense physical strength that it possesses. In addition, exposure to sunlight or exposure to any light source other than moonlight will cause SCP-322-1's form to dissolve into what would appear to be smoke or shadow. At no point has exposure caused any lasting damage or deformity in SCP-322-1's form.</p><p>Although SCP-322 was formerly employed as a storage facility for Project Thaumatone equipment and transport vehicles, it is currently dormant due to lack of personnel and maintenance. Recent tests involving nonmilitary personnel suggested that entry of less than five individuals could have occurred through the main gate during testing periods; however, all six individuals were either terminated or terminated themselves once inside the cave system before being able to enter further than 0m into SCP-322.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
