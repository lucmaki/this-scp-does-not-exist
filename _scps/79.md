<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-79</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The containment concrete structure is to be surrounded by an electrified fence of 10kV/meter with a perimeter of 5 km. The interior of SCP-79 is to remain free of human presence. It has been determined that SCP-79 will act only when the total combined mass of objects in its interior reaches a minimum of 100 kilograms. Any movement inside SCP-79 requires direct Foundation intervention and is currently handled by three agents on site.</p><p>The perimeter around SCP-79 is to be patrolled daily. Patrols are to consist of two or more personnel, who are to enter and exit SCP-79 together, carrying a maximum combined mass of 500 kilograms. A minimum of five personnel are present on each patrol; any patrol under four is subject to immediate recall. No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-79 before the arrival of the next patrol. Personnel entering SCP-79 without prior approval from their supervisor are considered "lost". This applies even if a patrol was just recalled for whatever reason and has not yet left SCP-79's interior.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-79 is a six (6) story, formerly abandoned concrete building. The interior structure has been altered over the years since its abandonment; at one time, an elevator had been installed inside SCP-79, but it is currently defunct and doesn't function. Beneath the lower five stories of SCP-79, there exists a large underground storage facility for refuse, filled with containers and other various fixtures which are unknown to have any known purpose. Containers in this area have a similar design to those found in a standard 4 cubic meter dumpster; however, their contents vary widely. Items recovered from SCP-79 vary greatly as well; most commonly found are non-biodegradable plastics like grocery bags or used clothing, or solid wastes such as plastic bottles, used diapers and cooking oil.</p><p>The remaining space between the sixth and seventh floors contains an elevator terminal which has been modified to suit its current purpose. The terminals of the elevator remain largely untouched despite extensive tampering attempts; however, the elevator itself is completely out of order, stopping at every floor with an increasing delay between each stop. No signs of recent operation outside of maintenance are evident on the elevator itself. However, if an object is placed in the bin on any floor where the elevator stops, it will automatically activate and begin moving upwards. If it reaches the level of the first floor (or underground storage area), it will operate normally again and return to the point where it was left; if not, it will continue to move towards whatever floor was left until reaching either the first floor or exhaustion, whichever occurs first.</p><p>At no point does an object leave SCP-79's interior if not being moved by personnel within SCP-79; all items must be placed by an individual outside of SCP-79 first prior to entering, then inserted into one of four active elevators inside SCP-79. Any items left in any bin within SCP-79 will experience anomalous behavior after being removed from said bin; less commonly occurring behaviors include objects cooking to decomposition even when separated from other items, or objects spontaneously combusting into smoke after removal from a bin.</p><p>SCP-79 was discovered during routine investigation following reports of increased vandalism near a local commercial dumpster company.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 79-1:</strong> Following a near miss with an abandoned office building, several instances of SCP-79-A were discovered within the interior of the building. The specimens have been contained and moved to a secure location in Site-█.']</p>
