<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-348</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> ██ guards ("The Clowns") are detailed to patrol the perimeter of SCP-348, checking for instances of SCP-348 and a state of childlike fear. They are to be armed with high-caliber firearms, and are to report any young children who attempt to enter SCP-348, or those who show signs of distress. Any instance of SCP-348 they discover is to be suspended until SCP-348 is contained.</p><p>Public strangeness has led to the creation of the MoCo (Middle Class Concern) Task Force, which has been assigned with overseeing SCP-348's containment.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-348 is an abandoned apartment located at ████ ████ ████████. It appears to have been demolished over the past five years, and has not been occupied since ████. SCP-348 was previously owned by Mr. ██████, who died from a sudden heart attack in his sleep in 1983. When the Foundation acquired SCP-348 in 1981, no anomalous properties were noted until 1981.1981 Addendum A</p><p>On March 7th, 1981, an instance of SCP-348 reappeared outside ██████ Hospital, which was previously the location of SCP-348's previous containment, after being mistaken for a child in need of medical attention by Dr. █████, who was on her way home after working graveyard shift at ██████ Hospital. Dr. █████ responded to the call and discovered SCP-348s standing at attention behind a police barricade around the square near the hospital. A Foundation investigation was launched shortly after this incident, and led to the eventual discovery of SCP-348's real nature. The following incident took place within two minutes of the first instance of SCP-348 appearing outside the hospital:</p><p>Dr. █████: "Yo! Can I help you?"</p><p>SCP-348: "You're not supposed to be here!"</p><p>Dr. █████: "Uh… okay? Why don't –"</p><p>SCP-348: "We're called 'Clowns!' And you are not supposed to be here! You should run away now!"</p><p>(Cuts out for several seconds)</p><p>Dr. █████: "Uh… okay… uh… what's wrong?"</p><p>SCP-348: "We're going to put on a good show! You're not supposed to be here!"</p><p>[From here, SCP-348 presses its body against that of Dr. █████.]</p><p>Dr. █████: "Well… you're right." (Note: Dr. █████ is only identified as male because SCP-348 seems incapable of distinguishing between genders.)</p><p>SCP-348: "You've got to go now! Goodbye!" <End Log></p><p>(Note: Dr. █████ was making his way out of town on foot when he tripped and fell into a ditch.) After Dr. █████ reported this incident immediately, an MTF team was dispatched across town and arrived at the location within 20 minutes.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum B:</strong> Following a successful containment of SCP-348, the first floor of the building became inhabited by a family of three: Mr. and Mrs. ████████ and ████ ████████, who are able to speak and understand English. They have been informed of SCP-348's nature, but do not seem to be in any distress. They were provided with a bedroom and living room, and are permitted to live in the building as long as they maintain their residence and behave themselves."]</p>
