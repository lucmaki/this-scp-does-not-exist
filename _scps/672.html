<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-672</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation is to maintain a permanent presence in ██████. The town is to be guarded by security forces, and the surrounding area patrolled with an aircraft. Any civilians affected by SCP-672 are to be detained and administered amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-672 is an anomaly that initially manifested on April ██, 1973, one year after the Vietnam War ended. SCP-672 affects civilians who have served in the Vietnam War, with their effects extending to their descendants.</p><p>After the first manifestation of SCP-672, instances affected by SCP-672 will exhibit behavior that is attributed to psychological and physical trauma sustained in the war. Affected subjects will regularly draw the attention of Foundation personnel, as well as civilians who are aware of the phenomenon. When interacting with civilians, affected subjects will progress into highly depressed and withdrawn states, often refusing food or attending mandatory therapy sessions.</p><p>Tests show that SCP-672's effect is permanent, regardless of treatment and intervention provided; there are no known cases of those effected exhibiting symptoms of PTSD or depression lasting less than five years after its initial manifestation.</p><p>SCP-672 was first discovered when an instance of ████████ ██████ (a Vietnamese civilian) was detained at a Los Angeles hotel for drawing attention to his depression by killing himself in what was later revealed to be a failed suicide attempt. The subject’s body was recovered and brought into containment following the event; it was noted that his pulse had significantly lowered to 7 times normal rate. The subject’s brain tissue was found to be anomalous; upon analysis, it was determined that he had been affected by SCP-672 following the 1975 American withdrawal from Vietnam.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/█/1995, a female civilian of Vietnamese descent living in [REDACTED] was detained after drawing the attention of Foundation personnel. She questioned her detainment and claimed to be unaware of being affected by SCP-672. After three days in custody, she began exhibiting symptoms of severe depression, refusing food and going into a catatonic state. She was then administered amnestics and released.</p><p>The amnestic's effects wore off over the next sixteen years, at which point the subject was seen again by Foundation personnel. She was then admitted to a civilian psychiatric hospital for treatment. During her stay in the facility she attempted to commit suicide by jumping off of a building; however, she was saved by security personnel and brought into containment. The subject was later upgraded to Keter classification.</p>
