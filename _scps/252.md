<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-252</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A picture of SCP-252 is to be placed behind the bar in all instances of SCP-252 to prevent the use of its glamour.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-252 is the name given to a small private club located in Long Island City, New York City. SCP-252 is a "gentlemen's club for the gentlemanly" according to its sign and staff.</p><p>The interior of SCP-252 is decorated in a style matching that of a stereotypical cabaret nightclub. The majority of the clientele do not leave from the ceiling to expose the bar area, which is typically reserved for patrons seated at tables. This extends to all balconies and levels accessible from floors above or below those allocated for seating. Patrons who attempt to access these areas will be greeted by an automated voice claiming that the area is reserved for dancing and the like and that such individuals are not welcome. Patrons are permitted to deduct up to 150 credits from their bills if they are denied access and directed to speak with a staff member on duty.</p><p>The cover charge for entrance into SCP-252 is 50 credits, but any patron who can prove he has paid would be treated as a free guest of SCP-252. Interested parties who have received permission from Foundation agents may make their first visit during an interview with Dr. Corso scheduled three days after they have been interviewed by security personnel in expectation of their arrival at their final destination.</p><p>Drink orders are automatically taken by the staff, with no interaction necessary on behalf of the patron. Orders are placed via databases linked to automated wine dispensers throughout SCP-252; it should be noted that standard beverage packages for each type of alcohol available at least offer basic information about each drink, such as how much it costs and what supplies are used in its creation.</p><p>Drinks distributed by these dispensers will always contain precisely 2 liters of liquid when brought to the patron's table or chair, regardless of the actual size required for consumption (such as 1 liter glasses used only by older patrons). Furthermore, this beverage cannot be made into two or more servings simultaneously by any mechanism other than filling whatever vessel is available at hand until it reaches its maximum capacity; attempts to mix beverages previously made will result in them becoming separated on contact.*</p><p>The ability of some individuals to distribute drinks freely despite having limited resources (particularly those with dietary restrictions) has been noted as anomalous among Foundation personnel assigned at SCP-252; however, as these medications are obtained through legitimate channels, resupplying them with more than one such product per month would be considered unnecessary by other departments.</p><p>Dining instructions have been altered so that "patrons may dine together if they choose" regardless of their potential abilities; likewise, multiple items on tables may be consumed together through working together toward a common end rather than independently.*</p><p>In addition to its restaurant services, SCP-252 serves various drinks banned in other establishments (including poisons), allowing patrons inside SCP-252 to evade normal laws against consumption of illegal substances without penalty.* All servers appear as regular civilians unless records indicating otherwise were obtained beforehand; further details on this anomaly may be found below.</p><p>Further information on known anomalies associated with Foundation personnel assigned or formerly assigned to SCP-252 may be found here: http://www.scpuk/overview/2281/</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Records of SCP-252 have been obtained through various sources and are listed below. The following excerpts have been translated from the original French and Spanish due to their historic relevance, with translation notes provided to aid the reader in understanding what is being described.</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Agent Melendez enters SCP-252 and approaches a waitress, who prepares to serve him a drink. As she begins pouring, he states that he is looking for "Mr. Rojas" (a bartender in SCP-252). She pauses and states that she is unfamiliar with the name, but that she will find him. Agent Melendez then asks if he works there, receiving no response. He then asks again, asking if the man is there. The waitress pauses once more, this time stating that the man had been there not long ago but had left to visit his family in Florida. She then mentions the man\'s "family", which includes his mother and a sister.</p><p><strong>(Note:</strong> An investigation into the identity of the waiter or waitress who has been serving Melendez during this interview is underway.)</p><p>Agent Melendez then asks about his job as a bartender and receives an affirmation from her; he then asks about the name of the "cabaret" itself. The woman indicates that it is called "Le DÃ©but D\'une Vie" ("The Beginning of a Life"), due to its location in the "heart of Long Island City". Agent Melendez then asks if the cabaret serves drinks free of charge, to which she responds affirmatively; after this, he asks about the prices of drinks and receives her explanation of how they are composed by a computer and then put into dispensers by robots. Agent Melendez points out that they appear on tables without any human interaction, to which she responds in agreement, stating that this is because some patrons are incapable of moving their hands enough to operate themselves properly.</p><p>Agent Melendez then asks if he can pay the waitress to bring him a drink so that he may leave; after a brief pause, she accepts and puts down her tray. Agent Melendez then turns around, but notices a man behind him and proceeds to ask him if he works at SCP-252, receiving no answer. Agent Melendez turns back to the waitress and asks her where he could obtain drinks for free; she responds by pointing behind him toward one of the employees of SCP-252 who is waiting for someone outside.*</p><p>[END LOG]</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Agent Melendez walks up to SCP-252\'s front door and notices a sign out front stating that security personnel are on duty from 6 AM to 2 AM; after observing them for several minutes, he enters the building.*</p><p>Agent Melendez approaches one of the security officers guarding the premises and asks whether or not he has permission to enter; after receiving no affirmative response, he approaches another employee of SCP-252 who is resting at a table in the bar area and asks him if he can get him a drink; upon receiving an affirmative response, Agent Melendez proceeds to order two beers.*</p><p>A third security officer approaches Agent Melendez after hearing his request and appears surprised that he has been granted permission to enter SCP-252; he places his hand on his holster and states that he must inform his superiors about this irregularity on their behalf.*</p><p>Agent Melendez nods in agreement and states that he understands before turning around; when facing away from the security officer, he notices another employee standing behind him.*</p><p>The second employee expresses surprise when Agent Melendez turns around, stating that she was not aware that visitors were allowed inside; she offers to get him a drink while they wait for their turn.*</p><p>After several minutes pass with no response from either employee, Agent Melendez begins searching for someone to talk to; while doing so, he notices several employees wearing uniforms similar to those worn by security officers in SCP-252 approaching them.*</p><p>The first employee grabs one of Agent Melendez\'s arms and pulls him toward an exit door near the bar area, saying that they must leave immediately before all other staff members arrive; after arriving outside, she pulls him further into an alleyway and rapidly states that Foundation agents are visiting SCP-252 and that such persons are expected to leave immediately*</p><p>The second employee who had been assisting Agent Melendez orders him away from SCP-252 before pulling out her gun and firing at nearby walls before running off into another alleyway*']</p>
