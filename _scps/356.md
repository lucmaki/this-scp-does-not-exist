<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-356</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-356 is to be kept in a standard clear plastic display bottle and stored off-site, in a secure location. If empty and stored properly, SCP-356 is harmless; however, if punctured, it will spontaneously ignite and begin to burn on contact. The resulting fire will continue to burn until extinguished. In the event that SCP-356 falls into a container holding combustible materials, such as paper or cloth, the result will be identical to those described above.</p><p>The containment box used for SCP-356 is designed to be airtight, but if the source of an ignition attempt is outside the containment box (such as through an unprotected window), the item will ignite regardless of whether or not the source of ignition was inside the containment box. Furniture that extends into liquids is not safe from SCP-356's effects; for this reason, tables and chairs must have legs that extend into the liquid when placed on them. Containment cases for other SCP objects may not offer sufficient safety for SCP-356, and must be modified to prevent spontaneous ignition.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-356 is a clear plastic disposable "Cigars," with a label reading "F.I.L.M." (Falling Individual Large Machine), manufactured by the French pharmaceutical company H.T.O., Inc.[1] SCP-356's anomalous properties manifest when it is in the possession of an individual, and properly stored in a non-incinerating containment area (such as the container listed under Special Containment Procedures) SCP-356 achieves ignition when it is in the possession of someone who wishes to use tobacco products, and will burn while its possessor is smoking it or otherwise using it. This can occur even if the smoking person does not intend to light SCP-356 on purpose; if a person with intention to smoke holds or even simply touches SCP-356, it will ignite.</p><p>The effect will continue until SCP-356 is extinguished by any means. This can include water from a hose, liquid from a fire extinguisher, or even soft drink poured over it (although this last method may fail because of residual fizz). If SCP-356 is dropped into any material which provides sufficient ignition energy, SCP-356 will burn for the remainder of its life span and produce all of the expected results - including incendiary effects, since it remains combustible.</p><p>The initial effect of SCP-356, spontaneous combustion when in hand of an individual who has intended to use tobacco products, has been seen as a potential risk to individuals and groups that rely on occasional tobacco usage in their activities. However, due to both technological limitations and public health concerns, such incidents are exceedingly rare.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 356-1:</strong> The existence of SCP-356 was discovered when a class of ██ second-year medical students at ██████ ██████ Hospital in ██/██/19██ noticed that the hospital\'s supply of surgical drapes had spontaneously ignited. A thorough investigation of the laundry room found the source of ignition, and the discovery that SCP-356 was among the items that had ignited.</p><p>At the time, its anomalous properties were unknown to researchers, but SCP-356 was placed in storage while the cause of its ignition was investigated. Upon further investigation, however, it was determined that SCP-356 could not be used on its own; it had to be "lit" in order to produce its anomalous effects. In addition, the laundry room had been improperly ventilated, resulting in massive quantities of smoke being generated at the time of ignition. The current containment procedures for SCP-356 were enacted in the aftermath of this incident.']</p>
