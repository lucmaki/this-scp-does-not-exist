<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-389</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-389 is kept in a secure chamber at Site-77. Please see attached containment report for general information.</p><p>A non-anomalous human male, of Caucasian descent, has been designated SCP-389-1. SCP-389's wearer will be referred to as SCP-389-1A.</p><p>Testing of SCP-389 is currently suspended pending results of investigation into the origins of its anomalous properties, which are currently unknown.</p><p>For additional information regarding the objects anomalous properties please see below.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-389 is a designer dress shirt with a total of seven anomalous properties. The shirt was made by an American company named "The Bartender" in the year 1955, and has been worn by SCP-389-1A.</p><p>Upon the wearer putting on SCP-389, all instances of SCP-389's anomalous properties will activate. When activated, these properties are able to be perceived by both SCP-389-1A and any other observers in close proximity to SCP-389. These properties include:</p><p>Properties 1 through 5 and 9 do not appear to have any effect when observed from outside a twenty meter radius of SCP-389-1A, but the symbols in each case will be distinguishable from other objects regardless of location.</p><p>When wearing SCP-389, all personal pronouns and time measurements are converted into Old English. These units are called "Denman", a reference to a prominent MD [REDACTED].</p><p>In addition to the above properties, a non-anomalous manor house located ████ miles from Site-77 (designated Site-77B) possesses ten properties that mirror those of SCP-389. To date, this manor house has not been affected by any of SCP-389's properties.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Discovery Log</p><p>SCP-389 was acquired by the Foundation after it was purchased at a used clothing store in [REDACTED]. The buyer, a Foundation agent posing as a civilian, was apprehended by agents posing as members of the ████ Police Department on ██/██/1955. His employment with the Foundation was terminated the following day.</p><p>The purchase of SCP-389 had taken place under the name "Oscar Jones" and had been paid for in $2 bills. The seller, who claimed to be a member of a local ███████ chapter of the Elks Lodge, had attempted to use a bartering system based on a series of arbitrary denominations, but had been unable to complete the transaction.</p><p>When questioned about his anomalous properties, SCP-389-1A initially stated that he did not know how his shirt worked. He later admitted that he knew what was happening but could not explain how or why.</p><p>On ██/██/1955, SCP-389-1A requested a transfer to Site-77 and provided the following information on its anomalous properties:</p><p>"I suppose it would be easier to explain these properties if I told you how they work but I\'m afraid I don\'t have that information."</p><p>"I\'ve found that wearing these clothes helps me keep track of time. Every evening when I take them off I think \'how much did I do today\', and then every morning I do the same thing but backwards. It\'s really quite helpful and keeps me from getting too frazzled during the day."</p><p>"I\'m afraid I don\'t know what \'fire\' means either."</p><p>It is currently unknown what the connection between SCP-389 and Site-77B is.']</p>
