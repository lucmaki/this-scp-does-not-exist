<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-555</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-554 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. A wall is to be installed around SCP-554, as well as at least one guard outside of the room at all times. Any personnel entering SCP-554 are not to bring any devices capable of transmitting data, and are not allowed to use recording devices of any kind within SCP-554.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-554 is a standard white digital sign with red, black, and yellow text. The sign reads "Danger! Radiation Hazard Area — Do Not Enter." It is attached to the wall of a stairwell of Site-██, which leads down to Level 3.</p><p>The walls of the surrounding area adjacent to SCP-554 display their own radiation readings that are consistent with those found in a small room. However, personnel entering into that room report feeling no radiation at all, and no pylons exist in the room.</p><p>When personnel enter into SCP-554, they feel as though they have entered into a radiation-less environment. This sensation does not change regardless of what equipment is used to measure radiation levels outside of SCP-554. If the device is later returned to normal conditions outside of SCP-554, the subject will report feeling as though they had been outside.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-554 was discovered on ██/██/199█ in the wake of a series of deaths of Site-██ personnel from radiation poisoning. The area that SCP-554 is attached to has been the site of several accidents involving radioactive materials, including a leak in 1991, an accident resulting in an unconscious body falling out of a janitorial closet in 1994, and several leaks in 2002 and 2008. These leaks were all proven to be accidental, and no source for the radiation has been found as of yet.</p><p>A draft report on the incident (see Document 555-A) is available in the current file.</p>
