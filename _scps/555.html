<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-555</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-554 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. A wall is to be installed around SCP-554, as well as at least one guard outside of the room at all times. Any personnel entering SCP-554 are not to bring any devices capable of transmitting data, and are not allowed to use recording devices of any kind within SCP-554.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-554 is a standard white digital sign with red, black, and yellow text. The sign reads "Danger! Radiation Hazard Area — Do Not Enter." It is attached to the wall of a stairwell of Site-██, which leads down to Level 3.</p><p>The walls of the surrounding area adjacent to SCP-554 display their own radiation readings that are consistent with those found in a small room. However, personnel entering into that room report feeling no radiation at all, and no pylons exist in the room.</p><p>When personnel enter into SCP-554, they feel as though they have entered into a radiation-less environment. This sensation does not change regardless of what equipment is used to measure radiation levels outside of SCP-554. If the device is later returned to normal conditions outside of SCP-554, the subject will report feeling as though they had been outside.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
