<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-20</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> It is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. The lighting in the cell must be dimmed to prevent its capture. It should be fed once every two weeks by agents wearing protective armor. Any portals that open in this cell are to be filled once again.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-20 is a male humanoid with a pale blue, leech-like body. Its total body mass is 1kg, but its mass is distributed unevenly. It has two spherical eyes and six tentacles.</p><p>It cannot be seen by the naked eye and must be seen using a special lens. Despite this limitation, it can be located with ease. The exact method of perception is currently unknown, although it has been observed to appear in various locations at great speeds.</p><p>The only characteristic that can be observed of SCP-20's mind, aside from its method of perception, is that it spends most of its time wearing a grin on its face. The type and number of teeth possessed by SCP-20 is unknown. It beings to regenerate every day at 10:00 AM Pacific Time.</p><p>SCP-20 feeds off of pieces of fabric and plastic which emerge from portals within its cell. It requires between 18 and 60 man hours to produce each piece of material.</p><p>Testing was conducted to determine what affect the increased mass of SCP-20 would have on its abilities. However, instead of showing any change in behavior, SCP-20's power was doubled in force three days after it was released from Containment Cell V1 (see Experiment Log 20-A). Despite this change, it did not increase in volume or mass.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 20-A:</strong> The following experiment was conducted to determine whether or not SCP-20 is sentient.</p><p>Experiment Log 20-A</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> ██/██/1995</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-5578</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-5578 was asked to wear a camera for 30 minutes, in order to document any changes in SCP-20's behavior.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> After 30 minutes, the subject removed his camera and reported that he could no longer see SCP-20. SCP-20 had disappeared from the area. Subject then proceeded to report SCP-20's behavior as normal. SCP-20 appeared and sat at the end of the table they were sitting at. It began to grin widely as if it were laughing. After 15 minutes, SCP-20 began to dance around the table, knocking cups off of it and causing a small fire to ignite when it passed over a candle. The subject continued filming. After 30 minutes, SCP-20 ceased all activity and returned to its normal behavior. Subject reported a feeling of 'familiarity' towards SCP-20 after this test.</p><p>After testing, D-5578 reported that he had encountered an entity identical to SCP-20 before. He stated that he had been teleported into an unknown land which was inhabited by the entity called 'Guf'. D-5578 was instructed to write down everything he could remember about this experience. He wrote:"]</p>
