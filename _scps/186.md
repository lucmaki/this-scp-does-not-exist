<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-186</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A large breeding tank has been constructed for SCP-186, situated within the containment suite. The tank is to be operated at an ambient temperature of 30-35°C and all experimental specimens are to be kept in a temperature controlled incubator. Containment chambers are to be shielded against high-energy radiation, and contain a rapidly rotating magnetic shield to act as a Faraday cage. All animals are subject to daily x-ray examinations to ensure that they are growing correctly and are free from lesions; any unusual growths or abnormalities are to be reported at once.</p><p>Former experiments involving SCP-186 require the use of Class-A amnestics with an initial dose of 0.3mg/kg, administered orally. After two weeks, the nuisances produced by SCP-186 will have subsided, and amnestic treatment can be reduced to one dose every two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-186 is a sapient species of rodent, designated SCP-186-1, which lives in the wild in ████████, ██████. SCP-186-1 is most closely related to the common house mouse and agouti paca (Dasyprocta punctata). Specimens are weakly migratory and are capable of living for up to ten months without food. All specimens grow from an early age and reach sexual maturity in their third year. Individuals become capable of hunting at roughly two years of age and reaching sexual maturity the following year.</p><p>SCP-186 comes in two varieties (designated SCP-186-2, -3) with significant differences between the two sexes. While eating fruits or vegetables, both varieties will produce Nuisance Spore Matter (NSM), a psychoactive compound similar to mescaline, through the mastication process. However, while consuming meat or insects, SCP-186-2 will also excrete Vomit Prey Matter (VPM), a material which induces nausea within human subjects after ingesting. Specimens have no judgment problems with what they will eat, as they have been observed devouring rocks and large amounts of concrete.</p><p>Upon ingestion by humans, the VPM causes intense abdominal distress and vomiting in all test subjects (henceforth termed "test subjects"). A total of seven test subjects were exposed over eight months to varying degrees of severity ranging from mild nausea to complete inability to stand without assistance. The severity of this effects varies based upon the amount of VPM consumed by test subjects and on other factors such as stress levels and health. Experiments with SCP-186 were suspended for two years after first exposure due to concerns regarding its long term effects on test subjects. Following extensive research into its effects by Agent ████████, it was determined that the ingestion of nonviable tissue is not sufficient to cause any permanent harm.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 186-1:</strong> Discovery</p><p>SCP-186 was discovered in May of 2009 during a routine survey of the ████████ region by Foundation agents. The area had been previously designated as a "suspected anomalous hotspot". Agents observed SCP-186-2 and -3 behaving in a manner suggestive of mating. No further information could be recovered at the time of discovery, although the site was established as a research site.']</p>
