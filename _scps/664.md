<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-664</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-664 is contained in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell at Site 49 due to its unique destructive capabilities. The level of security around the object is classified as Alpha-Level Clearance/Access Only.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-664 is a humanoid in the form of an elderly Japanese male, approximately 1.95 meters tall. SCP-664 displays no anomalous properties other than its enhanced reproductive capabilities among females. It has been identified as "Mr. Nakamura".</p><p>It was originally sighted on February 3rd, 1989 at ██████ [REDACTED] in Osaka by Agent Jack Moriarty, who noticed SCP-664's unusual reproductive rate and detained it with the intention of learning its origin and containment methods. However, the entire area was destroyed due to SCP-664's anomalous destructive capabilities.</p><p>SCP-664 is able to reproduce via: (a) sexual intercourse between any two humans; (b) drinking a large quantity of water; (c) entering into an environment with a large population of animals, most notably cats and dogs; or (d) touching an object made of glass. SCP-664 will attempt to take away the subject's life force while doing so.</p><p>The purpose of SCP-664 lies in its superhuman ability to produce water vapor from a body and expel it anywhere in the vicinity by using air pressure beneath its skin. This causes severe damage to all body tissues in a wide range of localities including bone, muscle, nerves, bone marrow, etc. If the subject is damaged to a point where it can no longer produce enough water vapor for SCP-664, it will consume the subject's water reserves regardless of whether they are inside or outside of their body.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On the morning of February 4th, 1989, Agent Jack Moriarty attempted to escape his cell by climbing out of a second-story window. However, due to a lack of lubrication from his artificial joints, he was unable to get any traction on the window\'s glass. As a result, he fell to the ground and was impaled on a fence post.</p><p>When asked about this incident, SCP-664 replied, "Lost track of time."</p><p>There is no evidence that Mr. Nakamura has died since its initial containment.']</p>
