<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-775</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-775 is currently being held in a standard containment chamber at Site-71. SCP-775 is to be watched by one (1) Level 2 security personnel at all times. A backup security system has been installed within the containment unit. The chamber and the power source are to be housed in a secure vault lined with Class-D security lockers. The door to the chamber is to be kept closed and only opened when necessary. No more than three (3) personnel are allowed within the containment chamber at any one time, and no more than two (2) at any time will be carrying firearms.</p><p>In the event of an emergency, the following procedures are to be followed:</p><p>All personnel are to report for duty or waste on over five minutes without input from monitoring systems. All systems must indicate that it is safe for personnel to enter the containment room until further notice.</p><p>If emergency instructions cannot be carried out, or if an emergency condition occurs when making normal return from a break in containment procedures, class D personnel are to enter the chamber, disable SCP-775's current power source, and employ available weapons to terminate SCP-775.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-775 is a humanoid statue, approximately 25 cm in height and 50 cm in width. SCP-775 appears to be made of an unknown material and has been carved with the image of a human. However, SCP-775's face is not identifiable by any available means, and it is currently impossible to ascertain its gender. The only features that can be detected on SCP-775's body are the hands and feet.</p><p>SCP-775 displays no signs of sentience or sapience. When approached, however; it will invariably make gestures towards the nearest human being (typically towards the person making their first contact with it) which invoke feelings of extreme calmness and comfort. Any portion of SCP-775's body may be pressed or touched in order for this effect to occur.</p><p>In addition, when subjects continually make contact with SCP-775, the subject will find themselves assimilating the memory patterns from all of the subjects that have made contact with it previously. These memories are stored in total within one (1) second of contact being made and do not take on an individual character: instead, they mean nothing if no subjects have previously been exposed to them. When first coming into contact with SCP-775, subjects feel as though they are experiencing these memories immediately after they have occurred. Over time however, subjects experience a vague sense of dejà vu, as though they have already been present at the locations shown to them by SCP-775 on previous occasions.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 775-1:</strong> SCP-775 was discovered in the possession of a non-anomalous individual, living in ███████, Italy. The individual had been found wandering a major thoroughfare, holding SCP-775 in his/her hand. Foundation agents were able to stop SCP-775 from being removed from the area until it was secured by local authorities.</p><p>The individual was highly cooperative at first, but when agents asked him/her to identify themselves, the individual became verbally hostile and violently resisted arrest. After several hours of questioning and psychological evaluation, the individual confessed to being an artist and having made SCP-775 as a gift to the city. Upon request, the individual provided photographs of SCP-775 prior to its anomalous properties manifesting (see file photo).</p><p>It was determined that this artist had been creating paintings of the same subject for many years and had never shown them to anyone except those closest to him/her.']</p>
