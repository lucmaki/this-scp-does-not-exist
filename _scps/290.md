<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-290</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area where SCP-290 took place has been sealed off and fenced off with a wire fence. Foundation agents are to monitor the area for any changes in the appearance of the area. Due to the nature of the anomaly, no permanent containment procedures are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-290 is an anomalous event that took place in the vicinity of New Bedford, MA, USA. SCP-290 appears to be a man of short stature, who is described as wearing a white shirt, black pants, and a light colored cap. This being appeared within a small cove in the ocean near be the point where it became commonly known as “Nantucket Island” sometime between 0000 and 0315 on June 21st, 1906.</p><p>At this point, SCP-290 would appear above water, pointing towards the island in a threatening manner. When it did so, the local fisherman would retreat to their homes and shut the doors. However, if any other person were present in the area at this time they would be observed to stare directly at the entity. Shortly after its emergence from the water, SCP-290 would make several loud cries before submerging itself beneath water once again.</p><p>Shortly after submerging itself into the water again, SCP-290 would begin walking along the coastline towards New Bedford Harbor. Upon reaching this location it would break into tears which resembled blood before fleeing into the waters once again. After this occurrence 7 individuals reported seeing an unusually tall humanoid figure swimming away with what could have been two children swimming near them.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On June 22nd, 1906, a young child was found dead at the edge of the water near Nantucket Island. The child had no injuries on her body except for a large gash on her head. The cause of death appeared to be blunt trauma to the head, and no other body I.D. was found at the scene. When questioned by the police, the father said that his wife had been babysitting the children while he was out fishing when she heard a loud noise that sounded like something “hitting a window.” Upon returning home she discovered their son unconscious and bleeding from his head by the side of the door.</p><p>As it appears this instance of SCP-290 is related to its original manifestation, further investigation has been suspended until such time as it’s occurrence can be properly contained again.']</p>
