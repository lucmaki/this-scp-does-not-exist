<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-872</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-872 is to be kept in a locked locker at Site-52. SCP-872 is to be stored with the rest of standard Foundation equipment whenever not in use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-872 is a military surplus backpack. In appearance, SCP-872 is identical to other standard rucksacks used in military training. The only distinguishing feature of SCP-872 is a large anomaly on the back that extends approximately 3 meters, and does not appear to be made of any known materials.</p><p>SCP-872 when used as a backpack for experimental purposes will often cause any equipment inside SCP-872 to fluctuate in temperature, move randomly and adjust its locality with the slightest change in position. If the equipment is within 10 cm from the center of the anomaly, a significant increase in temperature and decreased mobility can occur, until the equipment begins to melt into the center from both sides if not removed from the center immediately. During these events, personnel within 4 m including testing equipment are unaffected by this effect.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 872-1:</strong> SCP-872 was recovered from the possession of a deceased member of the US Army. The remains of the individual were found in a desert area, with signs of severe dehydration and malnutrition. The only documents found on the remains were a letter addressed to the Foundation, and a request for testing for SCP-872.']</p>
