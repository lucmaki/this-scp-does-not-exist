<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8 is to be kept in its original location inside a climate-controlled vault at Site ██. At all times, the interior of SCP-8's containment area is to be lit with several light sources that have been specially shielded from exposure to direct sunlight. In addition, high-quality (but relatively inexpensive) photosensitive film must always be available for exposure to SCP-8's effects.</p><p>SCP-8 must not be moved from its original location or removed from the climate-controlled vault. Removal from the climate-controlled vault requires Level 4 Clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8 is a 20 cm diameter sphere of polished nickel formed from ore with approximately minuscule amounts of uranium and thorium. While the mass of SCP-8 is unimportant compared to that of other metallic substances, the value of its specific atomic composition amazes all scientists who have examined it.</p><p>SCP-8 exhibits several anomalous effects in correlation with its atomic composition, most notably:</p><p>SCP-8 was first discovered in [REDACTED] after an investigation into a theft from a local college's physics club led agents to an abandoned warehouse. It was immediately classified as Safe, and placed in Foundation control.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-8 was discovered to have a remarkable effect on photosensitive film. After exposure to SCP-8's effects, photographic paper develops telltale murals of the stars that appear to be moving in front of the lens, as well as other patterns. This effect extends to all kinds of photographic paper, as well as to items such as standard printouts, videotapes and computer monitors. These effects are not limited to any particular kind of photography or media; however, the patterns seem to become more complex and elaborate with increased exposure.</p><p>SCP-8 was first discovered in [REDACTED] after an investigation into the theft of several meteorites from a university campus led agents to an abandoned warehouse. It was immediately classified as Safe, and placed in Foundation control.</p>
