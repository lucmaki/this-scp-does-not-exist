<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-511</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-511 is to be located in an airtight chamber with a single air filter capable of removing 99.999% of Earthly particulate matter, equipped with two fan systems capable of drawing 100 cubic meters per minute of fresh oxygen at maximum power, and a biological quarantine unit with single open window. The chamber itself is to be placed on a foundation that would allow for easy repair and maintenance by Foundation personnel. Surveillance teams are to maintain a 24/7 watch on SCP-511.</p><p>Any personnel entering SCP-511's containment area except for authorized research personnel are to wear radiation detection equipment. No person is to enter SCP-511's containment area unless they have been successfully tested on prior to entering the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-511 is a large chamber with four walls, a ceiling and a floor, measuring in total 215 m x 175 m. The chamber is lined with steel, and is pressurized to an approximate amount of 5 atmospheres.</p><p>On the ceiling of SCP-511's containment area are three concentric circles containing lighted red lights spaced equally apart from each other with a diameter of exactly 2.3 meters. The lights flash on and off in synchrony with the containment unit's internal clock, but do not emit any visible light.</p><p>SCP-511 does not appear to possess any objects that would be capable of moving independently of itself, such as vehicles, animals or even persons. In fact, any activity within the chamber appears to be limited to the act of viewing SCP-511; it does not seem to respond to physical stimuli (including pain), nor does it seem to possess a means of detecting or even transmitting its environment. It has been observed to display very little variation in behavior over multiple recordings and tests have been able to detect no discernible pattern except for the flashing lights on its ceiling.</p><p>It is impossible for any person to enter SCP-511's containment area except through SCP-512. SCP-512 maintains a mystical barrier that prevents travel between it and SCP-511, thus preventing access through natural means. Any attempts to bypass this barrier reactivates SCP-512's active ability; anyone passing through will be physically ejected from the containment room by strong air pressure.</p><p>The only successful method of entry into SCP-511's containment area has been by means of SCP-512 itself. It has been discovered that placing oneself within SCP-512 causes certain parts of one's body to disappear completely; these areas include the hands and legs, but also portions of facial features such as noses and ears as well as eyes and ears themselves (studies have shown that around 30% of test subjects lose both eyes at once). There has been no recorded instance where either their head or neck had vanished entirely without leaving some trace left behind; however, these missing parts do not reappear until the subject emerges back out of SCP-512 (most often after the process takes between 8 minutes and 48 hours); otherwise they remain missing indefinitely (all recovered fragments have since been reattached properly). The effects of visiting SCP-512 are permanent so long as they are allowed to remain inside its boundaries; however, due to various psychological factors which prevent many test subjects from staying within its boundaries while a portion remains missing, it is currently believed that it would take an extremely dedicated individual to remain within it for more than several days at most. Testing shows that individuals who have entered SCP-512 at least once can memorize specific details on what happened within its borders during each visit (see Addendum 512), though no subject has ever been able to accurately recall all events related back upon exiting again.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 512:</strong> Detailed documentation of the events which occur within SCP-512.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> SCP-512's main chamber</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-1884</p><p><strong>Event:</strong> D-1884 is entered into SCP-512 through the use of SCP-512's entrance, and is instructed to remain still while observing SCP-512. After several minutes of observation, D-1884 attempts to exit SCP-512, but finds that he has not yet fully exited; he has only exited his legs and head so far, with his torso remaining inside its borders. D-1884 begins to panic, and begins to struggle in an attempt to exit the chamber again. His struggles begin to cause the walls of SCP-512 to suddenly disappear from around him, revealing a large area directly underneath them; this area is covered by a large black cloth and is filled with a white mist, though there is no visible source for this mist. D-1884 attempts to exit SCP-512 again, and finds that his head has vanished entirely. Upon emerging from SCP-512, D-1884 is missing both of his eyes; after a few seconds, however, they reappear in their normal place and appear perfectly normal, though they are now blind. He then exits SCP-512.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> SCP-512's main chamber</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-868</p><p><strong>Event:</strong> D-868 is entered into SCP-512 through the use of its entrance.
