<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-637</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-637 is to be kept at a temperature of -20° Celsius in a sealed storage locker. A small wire cage should be positioned next to the object and overseen by at least two individuals at all times. Individuals affected by SCP-637 are to have their hands removed from their bodies and placed in the cage with SCP-637 until they are able to remove and place their own hands back in their own bodies. In addition to this, subjects must be instructed not to move their hands out of the cage for any reason.</p><p>All subjects with SCP-637 are to be given Foundation therapy for the development of fine-motor coordination skills and other useful behavioral changes. During this time, subjects are not to be allowed any contact with the outside world, outside sources of stimulation, or wayward thoughts regarding their bodies or hands.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-637 is a set of individual hands, with five digits on each hand. While the hands are biologically human in nature, they are able to move and animate themselves at will, even if the subject has medical paralysis. While the animation itself is not harmful to the subject's body, they may be uncomfortable while they animate their hands. The vocalization of SCP-637 occur when it sings or recites poetry.</p><p>When a subject is inflicted with SCP-637, their hands will begin to animate and move independently of their bodies. The animated hands will attempt to escape from their bodies through any available orifice, but they have shown no interest in harming other people, objects, or animals during this time. As soon as the hands are no longer animated by SCP-637, their bodies will return to normal. This process repeats on an ongoing basis until both hands escape from the subject's body and settle themselves into SCP-637's control again.</p><p>Subjects affected by SCP-637 are most likely suffering from some form of hemiparesthesia that causes them to feel phantom sensations in their limbs and fingers outside of their bodies. They respond positively to treatment for this condition, with most subjects showing significant improvement within three months following initial testing of SCP-637.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 637-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-637 escaped containment through the use of its hands. The subject was able to successfully animate both hands and escape from the containment locker. It was recaptured after several hours.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> 028245-D-J</p><p><strong>Containment Status:</strong> Amnestic treatment administered</p><p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> ██/██/████</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> Subject is a man in his late 30s. Subject had been assigned to clean out an old underground bunker in ██████, █████████. Subject has demonstrated an increased ability to perceive and respond to stimuli.</p><p>During cleaning of the bunker, subject used their hands to open several barriers and doors that were previously locked. As the subject entered further into the bunker, they encountered a large number of crates containing various artifacts and valuables that had been stolen by the subject's estranged family members before they disappeared mysteriously. After removing the contents of one crate, subject realized that all of the items were missing and had been replaced with human hands. Upon discovering this, subject became visibly upset, and then left the area.</p><p>Subject was apprehended three hours later in a residential home in ██████'s █████████ district, having been injured during their escape. Amnestic treatment was administered by Foundation personnel. Subject was found to be suffering from severe hand trauma after having punched a wall repeatedly in an effort to escape custody. Amnestic treatment has been deemed successful, with no effects on subjects' mental state.</p>
