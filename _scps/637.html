<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-637</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-637 is to be kept at a temperature of -20° Celsius in a sealed storage locker. A small wire cage should be positioned next to the object and overseen by at least two individuals at all times. Individuals affected by SCP-637 are to have their hands removed from their bodies and placed in the cage with SCP-637 until they are able to remove and place their own hands back in their own bodies. In addition to this, subjects must be instructed not to move their hands out of the cage for any reason.</p><p>All subjects with SCP-637 are to be given Foundation therapy for the development of fine-motor coordination skills and other useful behavioral changes. During this time, subjects are not to be allowed any contact with the outside world, outside sources of stimulation, or wayward thoughts regarding their bodies or hands.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-637 is a set of individual hands, with five digits on each hand. While the hands are biologically human in nature, they are able to move and animate themselves at will, even if the subject has medical paralysis. While the animation itself is not harmful to the subject's body, they may be uncomfortable while they animate their hands. The vocalization of SCP-637 occur when it sings or recites poetry.</p><p>When a subject is inflicted with SCP-637, their hands will begin to animate and move independently of their bodies. The animated hands will attempt to escape from their bodies through any available orifice, but they have shown no interest in harming other people, objects, or animals during this time. As soon as the hands are no longer animated by SCP-637, their bodies will return to normal. This process repeats on an ongoing basis until both hands escape from the subject's body and settle themselves into SCP-637's control again.</p><p>Subjects affected by SCP-637 are most likely suffering from some form of hemiparesthesia that causes them to feel phantom sensations in their limbs and fingers outside of their bodies. They respond positively to treatment for this condition, with most subjects showing significant improvement within three months following initial testing of SCP-637.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
