<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-440</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-440 is held by Site-47 at all times. The Foundation has a contract for the underground parking lot where SCP-440 is kept, and has the option to acquire it under certain circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-440 is a white Ford F150 pickup truck, bearing no markings or ownership information. SCP-440 exhibits no anomalous properties outside of its age and general wear and tear.</p><p>SCP-440 was recovered during an informal patrol by Agent ██████ following reports of missing persons in a rural area of Texas. It was believed that the two were religious extremists opposed to the Foundation's operations and had gone to ground in order to avoid capture or being interrogated by the Foundation.</p><p>When questioned by Agent ██████, all subjects claimed to have no recollection of their time spent with SCP-440, as they had not been conscious throughout SCP-440's operation.</p><p>The subjects stated that after sitting down in SCP-440, all their memories became more vivid and emotionally charged. Subjects continued to recall details about their lives including relationships and responsibilities, but some also claim to remember different perspectives compared to those already presented by their own memories. Eighteen minutes later, the subjects reported feeling sicker than they had ever felt before and began vomiting violently within SCP-440.</p><p>After three hours of being unable to leave SCP-440 and experiencing increasingly intense nausea and disorientation, all eighteen randomly selected subjects died upon exiting SCP-440.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Recovery Log</p><p>On ██/██/████, Agent ██████ received a call from a local patrol officer in the town of █████████, Texas.</p><p>Officer ██████\'s report to Agent ██████ included that a truck matching SCP-440\'s description had been reported by residents in the area and was currently parked in a local shopping center parking lot.</p><p>Agent ██████ arrived in the parking lot and retrieved SCP-440. The rear of SCP-440 was heavily damaged, with a clear imprint of the driver\'s seat where it had been resting. SCP-440\'s engine was running and had apparently been driven short distances before being parked. A large amount of blood was present on the passenger seat and dashboard.</p><p>Agent ██████ returned to the station and consulted with the local police department and local sheriff\'s office. The missing persons were identified as two males, one twenty years old and the other thirty five years old. They were believed to be recent converts to a fundamentalist Christian denomination known as the River Road Church of Christ.</p><p>Two weeks later, Agent ██████ received a package addressed to him from Site-47. The package contained an old cell phone and an earpiece resembling that normally used by 911 operators.</p><p>The phone was easily found by Agent ██████ among several other items in his home. The phone number showed up as "911 Emergency Services". Agent ██████ repeatedly pressed the number to no avail, which is inconsistent with common practice for emergency call functions.</p>
