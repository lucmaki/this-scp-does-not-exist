<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-440</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-440 is held by Site-47 at all times. The Foundation has a contract for the underground parking lot where SCP-440 is kept, and has the option to acquire it under certain circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-440 is a white Ford F150 pickup truck, bearing no markings or ownership information. SCP-440 exhibits no anomalous properties outside of its age and general wear and tear.</p><p>SCP-440 was recovered during an informal patrol by Agent ██████ following reports of missing persons in a rural area of Texas. It was believed that the two were religious extremists opposed to the Foundation's operations and had gone to ground in order to avoid capture or being interrogated by the Foundation.</p><p>When questioned by Agent ██████, all subjects claimed to have no recollection of their time spent with SCP-440, as they had not been conscious throughout SCP-440's operation.</p><p>The subjects stated that after sitting down in SCP-440, all their memories became more vivid and emotionally charged. Subjects continued to recall details about their lives including relationships and responsibilities, but some also claim to remember different perspectives compared to those already presented by their own memories. Eighteen minutes later, the subjects reported feeling sicker than they had ever felt before and began vomiting violently within SCP-440.</p><p>After three hours of being unable to leave SCP-440 and experiencing increasingly intense nausea and disorientation, all eighteen randomly selected subjects died upon exiting SCP-440.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
