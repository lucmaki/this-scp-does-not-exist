<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-570</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-570 is to be kept in a high-security storage locker at Site-77. During testing, instances of SCP-571 are to be kept in separate, identical high-security storage lockers.</p><p>All biological specimens that have been studied by SCP-570 are to be contained in separate cryopreserve vaults at Site-77.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-570 is a series of 12 books that contain photographs of specimens of various non-human animal species. Each photograph has been annotated with descriptions, statistics, and an explanatory text written by Dr. ████████.</p><p>Study of these specimens has been of great interest to the Foundation, with particular emphasis on the subjective analysis of skin coloration. As such, all biological specimens that have been studied by SCP-570 are to be treated as biologically hazardous waste products and handled accordingly.</p><p>The following is a list of the 12 books in each case:</p><p>Each book title is written in uppercase lettering. The authorship of each book cannot be identified; no indication at all identifies who the writer was, what parts they were assigned or edited, or when each book was published.</p><p>SCP-570's anomalous properties activate when a living being views a page from one of the 12 books (or any page from any book). Each individual shows different reactions to viewing SCP-570; some become anxious, others angry, while others become scared or confused.</p><p>If a person views enough pages from SCP-570, their perception of the world may become distorted in resemblance to those depicted in SCP-570's images. This effect has not been observed to last more than 24 hours after viewing SCP-570, but under no circumstances should a living being view more pages than necessary for the testing session.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 570-1:</strong> The following is a list of the biological specimens that have been documented by SCP-570.</p><p>Specimens taken from SCP-570 indicate that the book's author did not know these species existed, and were not published until after their discovery."]</p>
