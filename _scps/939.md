<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-939</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-939 is currently kept in a standard containment unit at Site-13. The object is to be kept in a separate section of the containment unit, where it may be observed for up to one hour every week. During this time, personnel responsible for SCP-939 are to remain within 50cm of the object at all times.</p><p>At no time should the object be moved or allowed to leave its containment area in any form. A small webcam is required near the subject's food and water, as the subject will attempt to feed on the camera when given the opportunity.</p><p>For information on amnesticizing and dosing SCP-939, please see Addendum 939-1</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-939 is an anthropomorphic cat, approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighing approximately 16.5 kilograms. The creature is composed entirely of living tissue, and appears to be missing several portions of its limbs. SCP-939 often attempts to feed on any nearby humans; this behavior causes a strong compulsion to the individual involved, and will result in them returning to SCP-939's containment area on their own accord.</p><p>When forced to remain within its containment unit, SCP-939 will attempt to groom itself until it develops several dozen fully formed and articulated legs that appear identical to its original limbs. SCP-939 will then proceed to walk upright at a normal human walking pace. The most notable difference between SCP-939 and a normal cat, is that the subject will speak with a nasality and an English accent typical of English people from the middle-ages.</p><p>SCP-939's anomalous effects do not appear unless it is fed by an intelligent being; if allowed to starve, it will revert into its original amorphous state. The subject has been shown to revert into this state regardless of whether the experimenter is capable of feeding themselves or not.</p><p>SCP-939 was first discovered in ████████, England after reports surfaced of a small humanoid creature wandering around the town at night. An investigation team consisting of agents from MTF Psi-7 (The Empaths) captured SCP-939 without incident before transporting it back to Site-13 as per standard procedure.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 939-1:</strong></p><p>After several days in containment, SCP-939 began to display a highly unusual behavior; the subject would convert parts of itself into legs and use them to walk around its containment unit. It would also form arms with hands and use the limbs for movement, and use the created limbs to examine the surrounding area. SCP-939 initially appeared to be unaware of its anomalous properties, but as time progressed it became more aware of its new state, and eventually began to use its newly formed limbs for mobility.</p><p>SCP-939 was later discovered feeding on a webcam. Over the next few weeks of testing, SCP-939 was observed using its newly formed limbs to feed on human subjects during testing. The creature has been shown to revert into its original amorphous state if left without food for too long.</p><p>The following information has been provided by Dr. ██████']</p>
