<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-155</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-155 must be kept in a standard containment locker. It must be kept behind a shatter-proof glass portal at all times. Tests must be conducted in a Class 4 Biohazard Containment Cell of at least 10,000 square meters.</p><p>SCP-155's containment area is to remain in a Type 2 Biohazard Containment Chamber. Any personnel entering the chamber must wear a full body suit and biohazard mask, or utilize an approved breathing apparatus. No personnel are allowed to enter without approval from the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-155 is a large sphere, measuring approximately 1.7 meters in diameter. It is constructed of a nearly impenetrable, glasslike substance that appears to be made of biological material (see Addendum 155-1). Despite its appearance, SCP-155 remains structurally sound.</p><p>When any living structure is breached by direct damage or force, it will begin to rapidly expand and deform until the structural integrity breaks down entirely and it will implode.</p><p>The rate at which the structure deforms is proportional to the amount of structural integrity remaining and henceforth follows Logarithmic Inverse Square law, with 1/25th of an ounce as the minimum viable unit.</p><p>Any object within a 25 meter radius will begin to rapidly expand and degrade in this manner unless an equal amount of mass is being added to it continuously.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 155-1:</strong></p><p>[Paste this text in a file on your computer, print it out, and then cut out the portion related to SCP-155.]</p><p>I am writing this in a failed attempt to get you to respond to my request for an interview. I was interviewed by Dr. ████████ last week when he discovered the anomaly's properties. I did not mention this to him and I'm writing this so that you can ask him about it.</p><p>We're conducting experiments with SCP-155 at the moment. We've almost perfected our containment procedures so that there are no structural flaws in the containment area that could cause catastrophic failure; we've also found a way to monitor the structure of the containment area. We have yet to find a way to make sure that the material inside isn't damaged or destroyed by the process. I thought that this would be something we could discuss.</p><p>If you'd like, I can provide you with whatever logs I have on the subject. -Dr. ████████"]</p>
