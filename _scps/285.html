<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-285</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of ██/██/████, Dr. ████ is not to leave the premises of SCP-285 without security escort. She is under no circumstances to be left alone in the facility, even for a moment. Any and all plants she has in her possession are to be destroyed immediately if any signs of decay or cancerous growths occur.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-285 is a recreation of the ██████ Recreational Facility, located in ███████, IL. The facility is composed of several different structures: a large gymnasium, several locker rooms, a cafeteria, and a lobby. There has been no activity at this location since it was abandoned in 1978.</p><p>SCP-285's original anomalous properties manifested sometime between 1959 and 1962. At that time, the facility began seeding itself with various rare plant species (including ██████ Tulipa and ██████████ Rose). Due to the anomalous nature of these plants, they were not removed from SCP-285 despite numerous complaints from various employees regarding the stench, rotting food, and pests. During this time, a Chinese woman named Dr. ████ was employed as the facility's head nurse. She was last seen leaving SCP-285 on █/██/15, presumably to retire to her home in [REDACTED].</p><p>Once Dr. ████ left the facility, all of the plants' anomalous properties amplified significantly. Plants began to grow rapidly and produce foliage at an unnatural rate (ranging from 10 times their normal growth rate to over 1.5 times). This accelerated growth caused major problems with growing the plants due to decreasing space for display and storage of specimens; as such, certain specimens were thrown into vats of boiling water to be destroyed.</p><p>After destroying these specimens, Dr. ████ returned to SCP-285 and began replacing them with newer flora as maintenance crews perpetually complained about the amount of space needed for growing new plants. By 1965, all but one laboratory, housing reptiles and amphibians, had been converted over to growing rare botanical specimens, including some which have never before been documented outside of China or Japan (such as Weeping Tulipa and Marching Grass). All plant specimens within SCP-285 have gained the ability to regenerate completely after being damaged - even if they are completely destroyed - just like their native counterparts. These creatures are responsible for causing massive damage to SCP-285's structure over the following years; however it is unknown how they are able to survive such damage without being harmed themselves.</p><p>The only surviving specimen not affected by SCP-285's plant manipulation is an African Grey Parrot housed in room B12-13 on Level 5B; this specimen appears unharmed due to its apparent lack of sapience.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
