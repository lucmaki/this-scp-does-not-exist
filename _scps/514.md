<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-514</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-514 is to be kept within a secure locker. No personnel are permitted to view this object without the express written consent of at least one (1) level 3 or higher personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-514 is a drawing in pen and ink of an early 20th century period British war poster, titled “OUR BRITAIN REDIVIVUS” (pictured). The original poster has not been recovered and has been assumed lost.</p><p>On the back of SCP-514 (facing the viewer) is the following inscription:</p><p>I have my sights set on you, nay!</p><p>Those who think they have learned to hide in the shadows shall soon be revealed!</p><p>The shadows of skulking ruffians make a good hiding place for traitors, but that's all they are.</p><p>So I will see you out into the open, where you may hang by your neck or be lashed to a gallows post – whichever method you prefer!</p><p>I may be merciful in this case – I'm inclined to be lenient with those who wish to turn their back on those who saved them from certain death!</p><p>Inscription was suggested by Dr. ████████ (see below).</p><p>Decompression experiments based on SCP-514 showed that a standard 1.5 meter x 1.5 meter room would expand under SCP-514's influence until it reaches its original size after ██ hours at which point SCP-514 would revert to its original state.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> This artifact is believed to have been created by the same person who created SCP-3229. Further research into this theory is pending approval.</p><p>Dr. ████████, who is currently on a temporary assignment at Site-19, requested permission to access SCP-514. Following his request, he immediately began writing out the following inscription, which remains unaltered to this day.</p><p>For the sake of every last traitor and every last Saxon scum who fought against us, I will see you hang!</p><p>I am your executioner. I will be your executioner. I will see you hang!</p><p>You will die by my hand. You will die by my hand. You will die by my hand. You will die by my fucking hand!</p><p>You will die by my fucking hand.']</p>
