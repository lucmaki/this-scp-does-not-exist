<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-367</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All PoI reports coming from the area surrounding SCP-367 are to be monitored for any activity within the surrounding area.</p><p>All civilians detected within this area are to be detained and questioned. Any UNN members found on site are to be detained, interrogated and administered Class-B amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-367 refers to a solar system containing an unidentified red giant star located in the center position of a REDUCE/DENSIFY sphere. Scanning from space has shown that the area around SCP-367 is composed of negative matter. Mind altering properties also exist, manifesting in the form of hallucinations and apparitions present on site, provoking from onlookers different levels of assistance.</p><p>SCP-367 consists of two distinct phenomena:</p><p>A. ██POI: A small, non-spherical area consisting of metallic debris and dust located near SCP-367's atmosphere (the one specific to it being comprised of aluminum). Within this area, there appears to be an instance of SCP-367's "aura" or "numinous presence". This aura is capable of causing confusional states and hallucinatory visions in humans who pass through it. When 12 individuals are present in this area they are able to interact with SCP-367's numinous presence. The numinous presence will manifest as a massive entity capable of taking humanoid form at the request of its subjects.</p><p>B. PoI Eye: An orbital habitat developed by NASA at Area 19 primarily designed to provide shelter for astronauts while they are away from their homes. As well as providing safety from radiation and meteoroids, astronauts are also given psychological support from trained psychologists during their missions in order to deal with the strain placed on them by being away from their family for extended periods. PoI Eye further serves as a waypoint between Earth and SCP-367, allowing technicians to monitor any farther effects caused by the aura effect in A.</p><p>Attempts to isolate and study the anomalous effects of SCP-367's aura have been unsuccessful due to the nature of the event itself: Subjects experiencing the effects are either unaware that it is occurring or too unhinged to coöperate fully with researchers attempting to observe it. Therefore it was theorized that these events were related to SCP-367 directly instead of indirectly, so containment efforts began to focus there.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
