<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-266</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-266 is located 400 km off the coast of Massachusetts, and mostly invisible to human eyes, all methods of locating it are to be banned. An electromagnetic survey of the area should be carried by the Foundation's covert operations team.</p><p>Any Foundation personnel detected attempting to investigate the anomaly due to its inaccessibility are to be incapacitated and amnesticized with Class-A Amnestics. After the experiment, they are to be permanently terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-266 is a 10 meter creature with a narrow body, and an elongated head and tail. Its limbs are very thin. It has 6 limbs for walking on land, and four for swimming in the water. SCP-266 does not seem to have any discernable respiratory or digestive system.</p><p>SCP-266 has no eyes, ears, mouth, or nose. It has no sense of touch; thus it has no feeling whatsoever. However, it is immune to pain due to its lack of senses.</p><p>To move SCP-266 is able to find/follow the metal scent of man-made objects, as well as the electromagnetic pulses generated by electronic equipment and wireless communications devices used by humans. When submerged in salt water it accelerates in a very peculiar manner; sometimes "pushing" itself forward by continually swimming down into the water, while other times "pulling" itself under the surface of the water. The only known technique to escape from SCP-266's grip is to submerge oneself in fresh water or activate acoustic jamming devices.</p><p>Scuba divers have reported that when SCP-266 has its eyes closed it can be disoriented and lost for periods of time lasting up to 20 minutes, although this occurs more frequently when SCP-266 is in deep water.</p><p>When SCP-266 surfaces for air and opens its eyes its vision seems much sharper than when it is underwater. This makes it extremely dangerous if the eyes are opened while it is close to ground level. If SCP-266 sees you break contact with its eyes at all during this time, or even if you don't see it but you hear a nearby scream, then run towards where the screams came from.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 266-1:</strong></p><p>On the night of November 18th, 1962, a remote island in the Boston Harbor was found to have disappeared. The islands were discovered to be completely deserted, and all of the buildings were in perfect condition. There were no signs of struggle or violence. The police were called in, and an investigation began.</p><p>Over the next few days, several corpses were discovered. All had been mutilated in various ways, and all of them showed evidence of having been alive when they were attacked.</p><p>A number of experts from local hospitals analyzed the bodies, and concluded that the victims had died of starvation before they were attacked.</p><p>The only unusual feature of the creatures responsible for the attacks was that they were extremely hard to see in bright sunlight, as they appeared to be completely invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>When SCP-266 is discovered, it belongs to a species known as "Nyctereutes procyonoides", which translates to "glowing blue cat". The last known sighting occurred on October 23rd, 2007, on an uninhabited island to the west of Nantucket Island (which is where SCP-266 was first discovered). Upon discovery, SCP-266 had been captured by a group of researchers who had seen it appear in midair and devour an entire team of four researchers.</p><p>MTF-████ responded to the incident, and after taking down SCP-266 with three tranquilizer darts it was brought back for containment.']</p>
