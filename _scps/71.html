<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-71</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The three known SCP-71 sites have been secured under separate Class V protocols, and have been placed under the direction of Omicron-13 "Project Pardus". The Foundation has established a fleet of mobile task forces at all three sites, each with a squad of security personnel and a specialized unit of demolitions and explosives specialists. These task forces cover the facility in question and install as many secondary safeguards as possible. Any personnel who stray too close to SCP-71 are to be considered Keter-level threats.</p><p>In the event that all other containment procedures fail, the destruction of SCP-71 is still the only course of action available to stop a full scale nuclear exchange between the world's major powers.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-71 consists of a series of thirty six nuclear warheads stored in twenty roughly ten km x 10 km subterranean caverns located in the Khabarovsk Region, Russian Far East. These caverns are connected to one another by three large tubes, each two hundred meters long. The warheads, which were set on their way by aircraft in early 1989 after being transported out of the city of Khabarovsk, have been scattered into these caverns. SCP-71 appears to be constructed entirely out of steel and concrete, although no records exist showing how SCP-71 was formed. SCP-71 is obviously a permanent installation; as such any attempts to dismantle it or remove its warheads will be met with extreme resistance.</p><p>Additionally, the weapons' status as nuclear devices is unknown; none have been tested or detonated since they were placed into storage. If detonated in or near an urban area the effects will be devastating; however the effects would be mitigated if the weapon is detonated at medium to high altitude. Testing on this theory is currently underway.</p><p>Each of the caverns houses one missile (designated as SCP-71-1), a specific type of nuclear warhead that is found only within SCP-71. After reaching medium altitudes, SCP-71-1 units will detonate and emit a limited blast radius from a cloud of vital radioactive materials that heavily damages electronic equipment and other mechanical systems. When exploded anywhere above ground level, the cloud will spread for several kilometers, causing extreme harm to all biological life within its blast radius. This effect does not occur until detonated above land level; however it takes several minutes for a device to reach ground level once it enters atmosphere - thus allowing sufficient time for local populations to evacuate and safety protocols to take effect.</p><p>SCP-71 has been recorded killing off plant life in nearby areas and damaging infrastructure as far away as ██ miles away. It appears that no form of antiviral defensive medicine or even radiation sickness can prevent death from exposure within this radius; however those who are exposed are often able to survive if they remain vigilant until the blast wave passes over them.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 71-1:</strong> SCP-71 was first discovered when a small group of Russian scientists were exploring the caverns in the Khabarovsk Region when they came upon a fully functional missile unit.</p><p>The scientists were able to decipher the device's programming and use it to detonate the device above ground level. The resulting blast killed them instantly, but allowed the scientists to determine that SCP-71 functioned as it did due to the warheads' radioactivity. However, no additional warheads have been found."]</p>
