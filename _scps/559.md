<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-559</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-559 is to be kept at Bio-Site-56 in a standard humanoid containment room to prevent any escape. The chamber is to contain an air conditioner and have a temperature of 24-25 degrees Celsius as ambient temperature is not important. SCP-559 is to be fed a balanced diet of human grade protein and extra vitamins to sustain itself in its current state. If SCP-559 needs any medical attention, personnel with Level 2 or 3 Clearance may enter the chamber. Any attempts to capture SCP-559 are to be aborted by immediate termination of all involved personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-559 is a human female of approximately 50 years of age.</p><p>SCP-559 possesses no biological functionality, but instead is able to produce, control and distribute SCP-059 through the air in a radius of roughly 20 meters. SCP-059 is capable of maintaining its properties despite being away from the original source and at atmospheric pressure levels. SCP-059 is composed of polyhedral magnesium silicate particles which will adhere to any surface. At 25 degrees Celsius, the density of the particles can be adjusted while they are in suspension by gaseous SCP-059, but this ability degrades as SCP-059 rises in temperature. When SCP-559 is producing SCP-059, it will remain idle unless provoked. The temperature generated by SCP-559's body is not harmful to humans or other organisms which are not made up of carbon compounds; however those organisms are only capable of supporting or propelling themselves against the surface on which they are standing.</p><p>SCP-558 refers to a specific instance in which an individual has been exposed to an uncontrollable amount of SCP-059 that has reached critical mass and caused them to collapse into their own personal universe formed from their own bodily waste products. As these universes created from bodily waste are unable to contain any higher order logic than basic instinctual drive and goal seeking behavior, these universes typically consist of a single place that serves as home for the subject and everything necessary for survival in the universe. These universes vary greatly in size and shape, but most have similar structures in terms of architecture, location and layout. A majority of individuals found inside an SCP-558 instance function as what would be normal life forms within their universe; others seem to have had more significant role within their universe than others.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-559 was contained after a Foundation raid on Site-56 in October ██, 2001. The raid was conducted after reports of civilians being found collapsing into their own personal universes. After the raid, SCP-559 attempted to escape but was quickly recaptured by security personnel. SCP-559 has been contained without incident since then.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Agent ████</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-559</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Good afternoon. I'm Dr. █████ and this is my associate Agent ████. We'd like to ask you some questions about your environment and your experience while within it.</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> Hello. It's good to see you again. I wasn't expecting any visitors today.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> We're not here to harm you at all, so don't worry about that. We just want to learn more about your environment and how it affects you while you're there.</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> No, no, no. I don't need to see anyone or anything else for that matter, I'm really fine here.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Are you sure? You look a bit tired.</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> I'm okay, really I am. Are we done here?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Not quite, but we'll get there soon enough. How long have you been here?</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> About six months now, but I can't say that it feels like six months. I keep forgetting what day it is, or what month and year it is for that matter. It doesn't feel real at all though, so it doesn't matter when it actually is anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> What are you doing in your universe then?</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> Nothing much, just trying to get by and stay alive as long as possible, but that isn't really possible here and I don't really know why anyone would willingly go here in the first place anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> How do you mean?</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> Well, look around you; everything here is basically made up of filth and waste products from everyone else who also spent their time here in an effort to survive in their own personal hells with no hope of escaping them anytime soon or ever again… What kind of horrible life would that be? So I guess they just didn't want to die anymore or something like that… But even if they did, they couldn't escape any further than what they were already in, so they'd just be trapped there forever… That's why this place exists in the first place, there's nothing else out there beyond what's already here… So why would any of us want to come here and suffer through this place when we could just live as we normally do? These are the kinds of things that go through my head every day… so it's better not to think about it too much because I'll just drive myself mad in here… But it's better than dying of starvation or disease or whatever the others chose to do or not do because they couldn't go any further than what they were already in… And if a few people think that it's better to die than to live in this kind of place then that's what happened for them… So yeah… It really is no better than death for me anyways… So yeah… Sorry if this came off as rude or something like that… It's not really my fault anyway…</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> No worries at all, we understand completely how you feel Mr.…?</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> [pauses] Is there a problem?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> No problem at all sir, please call us back when you're finished apologizing for your rudeness earlier on though alright? We're not going anywhere until you're ready to go on with the interview.</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> [pauses] O-okay… Sorry about that, sometimes I forget how things work around here… But yes, please go on with the interview now if you wish to continue with my help tomorrow again then… Sorry again for rudely interrupting you guys earlier on… It won't happen again I promise!</p><p>[The interview resumes.]</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Thank you for your help Mr….?</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> [pauses] … Okada?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Okada? We'll take care of getting a name for you tomorrow Mr…. Okada. So what was your job before you entered your universe? What were you good at doing and what did other people respect you for? Did you have any hobbies or interests outside of survival and living day by day as best as you could in your universe? Did you have any friends or family members at all? Do you have any regrets from before you entered your universe or regrets from inside your universe itself? What are your plans for the future if there is one for you? If there is no future for you then what will happen to your universe when the current population (if any) dies out? How long do you think that will be if the current population (if any) dies out? If you can answer these questions then we can get started with providing improvements for your current lifestyle or we can make an effort towards helping others within the same situation as yours Mr…. Okada…</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> Thank you! It's my pleasure! Can I finish off with what I was doing before coming here today before we start talking about my past and future plans though? I haven't done anything since coming here today so far except eat and sleep and try not to think too much anymore which is good enough for me but maybe there are other things I could do instead of just sitting around all day… Maybe there are other ways of living other than dying right after our minds stop working right now and thinking about how we died… Maybe this place isn't all that bad after all and we can make better use of our time and space here than just wasting away slowly each time someone dies less than twenty miles away from us each second of every day for years and years every second of every day until one day we die too….</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Uh huh… Go on with what else you wanted did you say Mr…. Okada?</p><p><strong>SCP-559:</strong> Oh yes! There are things I could do instead of just sitting around all day doing nothing productive! Things like collecting data from other universes along with other stuff like that… There are plenty of useful things about my own universe too! Can we do some research together later on so I can find out more about these things and how to use them properly later on? Or maybe even talk to someone who knows how these things work before I actually end up making things worse than they should be with my stupid mistake(s), especially if they might react badly towards me when they find out who caused it too?! Like if they don't want me doing stuff like fixing their stuff, then maybe they shouldn't let me in their universe in the first place right?! Maybe there aren't any problems associated with everybody not wanting someone else near them because they might accidentally hurt themselves somehow because they can't control themselves well enough or something like that instead?! Is it possible for things like us finding our way back home once we die too?! Or maybe even finding our way back home before we die!? You don't have to answer these questions if you don't want to but maybe there should be more places like this one somewhere where people from all different walks of life could come together and get things done together in a systematic"]</p>
