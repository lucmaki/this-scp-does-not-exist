<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-993</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-993 is currently contained inside the ████████ Deep Space Research Facility (DSRF) located in [REDACTED]. All personnel entering SCP-993's containment area are required to wear full space suits with a full body lead shielding system.</p><p>The following equipment is required for any operation involving SCP-993:</p><p>Mobile Task Force Theta-4 ("Dragonshield") is to monitor and study SCP-993 for any possible threats, and to contain any civilians who may be affected by SCP-993.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-993 is a crescent-shaped silver object with a diameter of approximately 20 meters. It has an approximate weight of 1,500 metric tonnes, and is mainly composed of adamantium, although portions of its surface are composed of various other metals. The surface of SCP-993 is highly reflective and durable, and, despite being metallic in all respects, it does not reflect light. SCP-993 also radiates heat of approximately 5,000 Kelvin.</p><p>SCP-993 is capable of causing any living being within range to become subject to the effects of SCP-993, regardless of origin or condition: all subjects will be compelled to approach the object and attempt to touch it for a number of minutes until the subject dies or falls unconscious from exhaustion. After this time period, the subject's body will lose consciousness and cease all bodily functions. If a subject remains conscious after the effect ends, it will begin to immediately experience intense pain throughout its body. This pain will continue to increase in severity every minute until the subject expires due to thermal burns or other trauma caused by the intense heat.</p><p>SCP-993 displays no anomalous properties outside of forcing subjects to approach it and touch it. Attempts to damage SCP-993 have failed, as any physical damage done to SCP-993's surface merely causes additional pain for the affected subjects.</p><p>SCP-993 was discovered on April 15th, ████ in [REDACTED], when Foundation agents were alerted by reports from local law enforcement that several wildland firefighters had reported a meteorite shower in northern California; several members of MTF Theta-4 were dispatched to investigate. When they arrived at the location where the fire crews reported seeing SCP-993, they found several corpses with severe burns surrounding SCP-993's location. Further investigation revealed that SCP-993 was then inbound to Earth orbit and that several casualties had been reported in large metropolitan areas before reaching their destinations.</p>
