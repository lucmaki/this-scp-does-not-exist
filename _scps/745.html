<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-745</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-745 is to be kept in a standard Safe Object locker at Site-██. Personnel attempting to use SCP-745 for recreational purposes are to be offered a bingo card prior to use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-745 consists of a length of bungee cord, with an attached lead weight (both to be found in the possession of SCP-745 at all times) connected by a large metal spring. The weight and cord are black, and the spring is yellow. The remaining portion of SCP-745 is comprised of a high-grade neoprene rubber fabric lining.</p><p>When SCP-745 is wound onto itself, the cord will stretch to an unknown length. When this length is reached, and SCP-745 is uncoiled, it will begin to move toward the nearest wall at incredible speed - reaching speeds over 500 m/s.</p><p>Once the cord reaches a wall, it will embed itself into it, with variable penetration depending on the material's hardness. However, when this happens the cord will stop moving; once removed from the wall, it can be released and rewound by removing it from the circular ring attached to its end. If unwound completely before removal, SCP-745 will remain in place until a new wall is approached, whereupon it will continue its escape attempt.</p><p>SCP-745 was recovered after a complaint about loud noises caused by fraying screamed out of an apartment window. Foundation Agents were on scene within minutes to prevent further damage resulting from the audible breaking of repair equipment used to patch a sewer pipe prior to demolition. The apartment's previous tenant had left two week's notice of his departure shortly after reporting that his physical therapy exercises made him too tired for quiet reading sessions.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
