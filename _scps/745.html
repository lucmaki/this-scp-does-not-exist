<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-745</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-745 is to be kept in a standard Safe Object locker at Site-██. Personnel attempting to use SCP-745 for recreational purposes are to be offered a bingo card prior to use.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-745 consists of a length of bungee cord, with an attached lead weight (both to be found in the possession of SCP-745 at all times) connected by a large metal spring. The weight and cord are black, and the spring is yellow. The remaining portion of SCP-745 is comprised of a high-grade neoprene rubber fabric lining.</p><p>When SCP-745 is wound onto itself, the cord will stretch to an unknown length. When this length is reached, and SCP-745 is uncoiled, it will begin to move toward the nearest wall at incredible speed - reaching speeds over 500 m/s.</p><p>Once the cord reaches a wall, it will embed itself into it, with variable penetration depending on the material's hardness. However, when this happens the cord will stop moving; once removed from the wall, it can be released and rewound by removing it from the circular ring attached to its end. If unwound completely before removal, SCP-745 will remain in place until a new wall is approached, whereupon it will continue its escape attempt.</p><p>SCP-745 was recovered after a complaint about loud noises caused by fraying screamed out of an apartment window. Foundation Agents were on scene within minutes to prevent further damage resulting from the audible breaking of repair equipment used to patch a sewer pipe prior to demolition. The apartment's previous tenant had left two week's notice of his departure shortly after reporting that his physical therapy exercises made him too tired for quiet reading sessions.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On 13/06/19██, an SCP-745 test was carried out. A length of cord less than 6\xa0m was purchased from a local sporting goods store, and then wound onto itself to a length of 12\xa0m. The weight and lead spring were removed from the cord, and it was then released to escape the confines of the laboratory.</p><p>SCP-745 travelled the entire length of the laboratory and through numerous walls before coming to rest in a corner. After testing proved that SCP-745 had not come into contact with any other objects during its escape, it was allowed to remain where it was. After approximately one week, SCP-745 escaped again; however, it did not rewind as it did before due to being in contact with several pieces of furniture. Upon rewinding, SCP-745 was found to have embedded itself into the wooden frame of a large wardrobe.</p><p>When questioned whether or not there were any similarities between SCP-745\'s escape attempts and those seen in movies or television shows, Dr. ██████ replied "I have no idea what you\'re talking about."']</p>
