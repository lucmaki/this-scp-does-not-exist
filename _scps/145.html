<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-145</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-145 is to be kept in a standard Safe object locker. SCP-145's anomalous effect lasts for seven days after exposure. Exposed subjects are to be monitored daily for any signs of increasing their numbers, and taken into Foundation custody immediately upon discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-145 is a biological specimen, composed of [REDACTED] and an unidentified organic compound. Upon exposure to air, SCP-145 begins to rapidly decompose and self-destruct, breaking down into a fine powder. This happens at a rate of 25% per twenty-four hours until the specimen is fully decomposed.</p><p>This effect will cease if the subject is placed in potentially hazardous areas such as high explosives or radioactive materials. These limits are to be enforced upon the subject by D-class personnel working in tandem with Foundation Object Containment teams.</p><p>During testing, subjects have been known to survive the process of decomposition for several weeks, retaining their original shape and appearance. However, survival beyond that point has proven inefficient; subjects will begin to lose themselves when they lose track of time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, two D-class subjects were exposed to an area where SCP-145 was present. While one subject remained as it was, the other attempted to escape via SCP-145's anomalous effect. After several minutes of intense decomposition, the subject's body was completely destroyed, leaving nothing but a pile of dust.</p><p>It is unknown whether or not the subject's death was caused by the effects of SCP-145 or [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>Subjects exposed to SCP-145 must be kept in a secure containment unit until further notice.</p>
