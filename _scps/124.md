<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-124</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-124 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber at the Foundation's Site-██. SCP-124 is to be fed one (1) chicken per day.</p><p>The area surrounding SCP-124 is to be kept under constant surveillance and guarded by no less than two (2) security personnel at all times, with additional security personnel as needed. No staff or other individual is to enter SCP-124's containment chamber without express permission from a member of personnel overseeing its confinement. Any staff found trespassing in SCP-124's containment area may be detained and administered Class-A amnestics as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-124 is a heavily muscled humanoid who, despite having been unconscious for more than two (2) years, shows no signs of physical deterioration. SCP-124's body mass is currently estimated at five hundred kilograms and the individual's height, standing upright, is six (6) feet.</p><p>The skin of SCP-124's face and upper torso is covered in coarse red hair that appears to be a combination of human and native gibbon hair. The hair of SCP-124's lower torso, hands, and feet are grey and appear to have been twisted several times over the body (see photo). Despite this coarseness, SCP-124 does not appear to suffer any damage to its skin or hair except for the clear absence of nails on one hand.</p><p>SCP-124 suffers from a condition that makes it appear as if it were originally a corpse before it was "resurrected". SCP-124 appears to have normal eyelids and natural teeth; however, all of them are blackened and rotting away. The flesh itself seems unaffected by decay; however, when SCP-124 moves, stumps emerge out of both eyeballs and the exposed molars rapidly rot away into nothing. Tests show that neither decay nor mutation affects SCP-124's nervous system; while they cannot move in any direction if they cannot see, they will continue moving if they do not feel their surroundings.</p><p>SCP-124's "hair" carries with it an unknown substance that causes it to stick to anything or anyone it touches or comes into contact with (see A video log describing exactly how things stick to SCP-124 is attached as document 124-24); thus far, there has only been one case of this property affecting objects other than humans (see transcriptions enclosed in Document 124-24). Determinations are pending.</p><p>SCP-124 had been found wandering around the Empire State Building on ██/██/2014 after [DATA EXPUNGED]. When personnel attempted to move him from his containment area he became agitated and began crying loudly very similar to a gibbon animal; then abruptly collapsed dead on the floor. This suggests some connection between SCP-124 and its physiology.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>24.1 Video Log of SCP-124</p><p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Testing of SCP-124\'s properties on a steel door with an EKG sensor attached to it, three (3) meters in distance from SCP-124. The door is placed on a table after the test is finished.</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>[+] ██/██/2014</p><p>24.2 Transcript of Video Log 24.1</p><p>The "door" remains unaffected by SCP-124\'s properties. SCP-124 begins walking towards the door and the substance on its body starts sticking to it; it goes through the entire process of being "resurrected" before it collapses dead on the floor. The substance does not stick to any other object in the room; thus, we can conclude that SCP-124 has a special property that causes its body to be able to stick to anything it touches. The substance itself seems to be some type of organic material; however, it remains unidentified at this time.']</p>
