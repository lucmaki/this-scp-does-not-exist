<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-380</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-380 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with the exception of testing. The door is to remain locked at all times. (See Addendum 380-1.)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-380 is a weighing scale, which has been modified through the addition of a platform, a bathing station and an air hose. The scale has come to be known as SCP-380-A.</p><p>The platform, which connects to the top of SCP-380 via a beam that extends through the middle of the platform and rests on the inside of SCP-380's base, is divided equally in half by a pair of walls that are 8 cm thick. When placed upon the platform, these walls disappear from view.</p><p>When tipped from within a bathtub filled with 1.5 liters (500 ml) of water, SCP-380 will weigh the subject for 60 seconds before descending again and returning to its upright position. If a subject lowers themselves onto the scale after it has returned to its upright position, it will weigh that subject for 60 seconds before descending again and returning to its upright position. This effect will continue until either 1) all subjects have been weighed or 2) all subjects have been removed from the bath tub.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, inanimate objects do not exert any gravitational force on subjects standing upon it. In addition to this fact, subjects can be left standing upon SCP-380 indefinitely without experiencing gradual weight loss or leakage of bodily fluids over time. Approximately 1000 kilograms (2000 lbs) can be posed and weighed at once exclusively by increasing the weight limit on SCP-380's platform until it cannot lift any more objects any further than 922 milligrams (0.9 grams). Due to this limitation, when testing with large groups of subjects attempting to weigh 3000 kilograms (5000 lbs), less than 5% were capable of doing so before reaching the weight limit.</p><p>Originally discovered in [REDACTED], ██ during routine maintenance performed at Site ██'s Southern Experiment Center involving ███ men, SCP-380 was kept under constant observation due to its nearly foolproof ability to weigh down test subjects housed within Site ██'s miniature containment facility. Within one month of maintenance being completed over three years after discovery at Site ██, numerous copies had been created through advanced manufacturing technology and distributed amongst various law enforcement agencies in an effort to combat organized crime involving counterfeiting currency and narcotics. Sheer exhaustion following continuous exposure made removal from SCP-380 extremely difficult until its aid was discovered 2 months later by Foundation operatives investigating reports of "levitation" originating from [REDACTED].</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 380-1:</strong> SCP-380 was discovered in a bathroom at [REDACTED] on ██/██/████ following a large scale of unknown origin being found in a public restroom located within the same building. The scale had been left by an individual with tendencies of necrophilia.</p><p>The owner of the scale, who was later identified as [REDACTED], had begun using it to weigh the bodies that he kept in his personal home. After a few weeks of usage, he became unable to remove himself from it and would only be separated from it by the intervention of the police. It was discovered that [REDACTED] had begun to gain weight due to his refusal to leave his "scale" and had resorted to cannibalism in order to maintain his weight.</p>
