<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-548</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-548 is to be contained in a partitioned testing chamber, lined with sound-dampening material. Twenty (20) instances of SCP-548 are currently stored behind electronic lockboxes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-548 is a set of fifty (50) blue-and-white ceramic paperweights. Each is 2.5 cm long and 5 mm wide, with the body being 3 cm long and 2 cm wide. It weighs approximately 1.8 grams each and has a hole in the center of its design space. They were produced between 1983 and 1984 by ████████, Japan under the ██████ brand.</p><p>The object is inert, able to be picked up normally, and will not shock or harm any living entity when touched. Attempts to burn or melt it have failed.</p><p>When placed on something at a distance of roughly one meter, SCP-548 will begin to move toward it at a rate of approximately 3 meters per second. Smaller items will take longer to reach the destination than larger ones, but the speed with which they are moved remains constant regardless of their size.</p><p>SCP-548 has been observed to affect human behavior. Even if an individual has no interest in the subject matter affected by SCP-548, or simply believes that their intentions are clever or original, SCP-548 will still affect them as if they did have such an interest or originality. Subjects have been found to mentally review artistic and creative work unrelated to the object, to practice calligraphy without doing so beforehand, and even to resort to dramatic interpretations of the piece of writing on their desks after wards.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-548 can be used to move objects towards a destination that is inaccessible to a human. The only limitation is that the object moved will be unable to reach the destination on its own. For instance, if SCP-548 is used to lift a person up into the air, SCP-548 would not be able to move them any further from their starting location than the force of gravity alone could.</p><p>SCP-548 was recovered from the office of ████ ███████, CEO of █████ Corporation. Upon his arrest, ███████ admitted to using SCP-548 for this purpose, stating that the object "taught" him the techniques necessary for his later endeavors.</p><p>Based on tests with small items and instances of SCP-548, it is believed that the anomalous effect is being produced through a combination of kinetic energy and motion.']</p>
