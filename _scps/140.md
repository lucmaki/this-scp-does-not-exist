<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-140</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-140 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. SCP-140 is to be provided with a single bed and one (1) pillow. SCP-140 is otherwise to be allowed unlimited access to the facility.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-140 is an otherwise unremarkable Caucasian human male. SCP-140 is capable of strong, athletic movements despite its large stature, and has demonstrated considerable skill in the martial arts.</p><p>SCP-140's anomalous properties manifest when it enters an enclosed space. Within the space, SCP-140 will begin to display obsessional behaviors that are consistent with high levels of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), showing various signs of anxiety that increase in severity with time. After several hours, SCP-140 will achieve a level of mental agitation that levitates it several meters off of the ground, causing it to twirl on itself repeatedly as it ascends.</p><p>When SCP-140's body reaches sufficient altitude, it begins to show signs of consciousness, manifesting as complex mnestic dreams about sites in the United States that have served as the location for failed attempts at constructing a White House start over the previous century. The dreams are not detrimental to SCP-140's survival and show no discernible effect on its behavior after awakening.</p><p>The dreams also display no apparent interest in any historical context besides prominent individuals attempting to construct a White House start in their own communities. Subjects that have appeared in SCP-140's dreams include:</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 140-1:</strong> SCP-140 was initially discovered in the residence of Eli ██████, a well-known actor in Los Angeles. After several months of consultation with Foundation psychologists, SCP-140 was brought to Site-19 and reclassified as Euclid.']</p>
