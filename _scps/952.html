<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-952 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-952 is to be kept alive and well fed at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-952 is a humanoid of unknown origins, physically resembling a male human with sandy brown hair, a beard, and hazel eyes. SCP-952's skin has a slight greenish tint to it, as well as a few scars on its left cheek. When not under direct observation, SCP-952 will usually wear loose fitting robes or clothing that obscures most of its body.</p><p>When SCP-952 speaks, it will usually do so in multiple languages. In addition to English and Russian, SCP-952 will often talk in Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese. These languages are all known to be spoken by SCP-952's species. SCP-952 will also make use of other languages when speaking to humans that are not native speakers of any language.</p><p>SCP-952 was discovered after an incident involving the destruction of a large portion of Yokohama, Japan. The Foundation's Office of Paranormal Research and Defense was contacted after reports surfaced of "ghosts" causing destruction across the city. The investigation concluded that several witnesses had been infected with SCP-952 while entering one of the destroyed areas.</p>
