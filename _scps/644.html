<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-644</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-644 is contained within a standard D-class containment cell. SCP-644 has no need for food, water or air-supply, and thus is not a threat to the Foundation or any other entity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-644 is an anomalous Earthbound Gardening implement. It resembles a standard pair of secateurs, with wooden handles and a wooden blade. SCP-644 behaves in a manner typical for other earthbound objects, always residing in the same place when not being used, and moving itself and its "mulch" at a desired velocity when being used.</p><p>SCP-644 also grows plants at an accelerated rate. SCP-644 continues to grow plants even if removed from outside of an environment (such as SCP-2099 or SCP-461). The current number of plants that have grown from this effect is unknown.</p><p>SCP-644 was recovered when Foundation agents captured a white light manifestation of SCP-644 (regarded as a high ranking entity) as it attempted to escape into the house of a local farmer. The entity was taken into Foundation custody and could not be located after the anomaly manifested inside a Foundation containment facility, despite intensive search efforts.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-644 was found in a farmhouse, where it was being kept by the farmer who owned it. The farmer claimed that he bought SCP-644 from a local antique store, before losing ownership of it. The owner of the antique store said that he had found SCP-644 in the garden of an old estate. The estate was abandoned for years, and had not been visited for decades.</p><p>A note attached to SCP-644 reads:</p><p>Found in the garden of an old estate, the owner of this "garden" passed away many years ago. I have no idea how it works, but I suppose it is mine now. The old guy was a bit eccentric, so I\'m not sure why he would have left it behind.</p><p>From my personal collection.</p>
