<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-223</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-223 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell is to contain two beds, one operating table and a shower. SCP-223 may freely roam the site between 0700 and 1900 with permission from Dr. Rimes.</p><p>When not working with SCP-223, researchers are to wear standard Site-19 protective equipment, including respirator masks, chemical goggles, and full-body hazmat suits. In the event of an SCP-223 outbreak, personnel are to be evacuated immediately.</p><p>Active SCP-223 outbreaks are to be suppressed by security personnel stationed at Site-19 who will deploy decontamination agents on affected civilians and civilian vehicles as necessary. Civilians entering Site-19 must also be decontaminated and administered amnestic if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-223 is a male human (SCP-223-1) that was removed from the [REDACTED] ██████ National Wildlife Refuge in █████, Alabama, on 05/05/19██ and scheduled for transport to the nearby [REDACTED] ██████ National Park. SCP-223 refused capture and attacked members of the Mobile Task Force after being transported to Site-19.</p><p>Recovered from SCP-223:</p><p>SCP-223 does not show any signs of aging and cannot be perceived as becoming physically ill, despite being exposed to harmful substances. SCP-223's food intake appears to be enough to support life with no known effects of starvation. Therefore, it is assumed that SCP-223 has no need for sustenance other than necessary biological functions.</p><p>SCP-223 is affected by all diseases that affect humans, including AIDS, cancer and heart disease. However, further investigation into this subject is currently underway. As of this note, SCP-223 shows no additional signs or symptoms outside of these diseases, but due to its vague condition, an accurate assessment cannot be made on its age.</p><p>SCP-223 has shown no pathology or abnormal physical development throughout testing. Despite its relatively unlikely lifespan, SCP-223 shows no signs of extreme fatigue afterward and does not appear to require rest beforehand. In addition, SCP-223 (which had previously been nonverbal) speaks fluently in English as well as Russian and German with little difficulty following instruction from researchers.</p><p>SCP-223 has shown limited resistance to pain and discomfort from injuries sustained while under Foundation custody; however, despite this resistance, SCP-223 must still be supervised during testing or experiments that may result in a wound or scarring.* As such, all limbs below the shoulder are bandaged during testing sessions.* While under sedation at the site hospital wing, SCP-223 will occasionally growl or cry out under extreme pain; however, this is not an indication of pain or discomfort on behalf of the subject.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-223's name was derived from the first letter of the first words that it spoke in English, Russian and German.</p><p>SCP-223 is currently being investigated for its anomalous properties and may be added to this list at a later date.</p>
