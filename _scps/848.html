<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-848</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-848 must be kept in a standard containment locker. Any instances of SCP-848 should be disposed of immediately in a noncombustible manner, as fire would cause another SCP-848 instance to manifest.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-848 is a series of twenty (20) synthetic penises. All instances of SCP-848 are composed of a black substance, which appears to be made primarily out of plastic. Each instance has an inscription on the base of the penis.</p><p>When a human subject makes physical contact with an instance of SCP-848, the inscription will appear in the subject's mind and urge them to "come back to me". After 5-10 minutes involving the subject having visual and auditory hallucinations, the subject will become unconscious and begin vomiting. The subjects body will then spontaneously transmute into a squishy mass resembling that of a human being, with distinct reproductive organs moving around in it's stomach. Subjects will then awaken in various areas across the world, as if they had been transported there by thaumaturgic means. While unconscious, subjects will typically attempt to leave their current location repeatedly before reacting violently towards any living creature from approximately one hour up to 4 hours after awakening.</p><p>Subjects who have been transformed into instances of SCP-848 exhibit no signs of intelligence; instead, they focus exclusively on mating with other creatures regardless of species or gender. When given enough time without being eaten or sexually assaulted, subjects will form rudimentary societies based on their area. These societies will typically try to do whatever they can to keep their members alive through hunting and gathering while attempting to avoid contact with other groups around them.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
