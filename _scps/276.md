<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-276</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-276 is to be contained in a standard containment locker at Site-19, accessible by Level-2 personnel only. In the event of an emergency involving SCP-276, 1 (one) D-Class subject must be utilized to remove the object from the containment unit and return it to its original location after the event.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-276 is a large bottle of champagne in the shape of a fire hydrant, capable of holding up to 600ml of liquid. When opened, SCP-276 emits no aggressive behavior, and is non-anomalous in regards to other anomalous objects produced by SCP-████. The only event in which SCP-276 displays anomalous properties is on New Year's Eve, where it functions as an amplifier for any noise within its vicinity.</p><p>When tested with varying acoustic signals, no uncommon phenomena have been observed from SCP-276 except for an increase in noise within the range of approximately 600 Hz to 1.2 kHz. Although this increase in noise has been shown to affect animals as well as humans, it was determined that both were under the effects of alcohol and therefore had a diminished perception of sound frequencies.</p><p>If the subject has consumed alcohol prior to testing at a volume sufficient to produce hearing loss, SCP-276 will cause permanent hearing damage.</p><p>Closing Statement: No further tests are required on SCP-276, as tests involving it pose little danger to test subjects and all information gathered on it has already been published by Dr. ███████ in Incident Report 276-1.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 276-1:</strong> Incident Report 276-1</p><p><strong>Date:</strong> January 1, 2009</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Site-19</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-8504</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-8504 is instructed to remove SCP-276 from the containment locker and return it to its original position. D-8504 must be intoxicated to the point of alcohol poisoning and have a blood alcohol content (BAC) of at least .05. If D-8504 is not intoxicated, the effect of SCP-276 will not be observed.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> D-8504 produces a BAC of .027, which is within the range of intoxication for a human being. After returning SCP-276 to its original location, D-8504 reports a ringing in his ears, which subsides after approximately ten minutes. Post Experiment Interview Logs indicate that D-8504 did not experience any hearing impairment as a result of the test.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The test was successful due to the diminished perception of sound by an intoxicated human subject. However, further testing on SCP-276 is not warranted unless there is evidence that this diminished perception is not caused by alcohol consumption.</p><p>SCP-276 contained in its original location.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Further testing has been suspended indefinitely due to the loss of records pertaining to SCP-████ following Incident 276-2.']</p>
