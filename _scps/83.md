<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-83</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-83 poses no immediate danger to human life, and containment is the responsibility of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). SCP-83 is contained in a capsule at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The space agency is to watch over SCP-83 constantly, making sure it does not exit the capsule. When not in use, the capsule itself is to be guarded. No personnel are to have contact with SCP-83 except for those performing maintenance on the space capsule or the nuclear reactor inside of it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-83 is a capsule containing physical evidence of the first manned mission to Mars, Project Orion. To this day, no interstellar craft has been able to reach Mars without traveling across the vacuum of space. This spacecraft was built in 1959 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under the direction of President John F. Kennedy, with the intention of reaching the Red Planet by 1967.</p><p>SCP-83 was originally launched into space on July 21st, 1961 as part of the Jupiter-C mission. After reaching Jupiter and travelling into orbit around it, SCP-83 was ejected from Jupiter's gravity well and sent to Mars, where it landed on January 6th, 1962 due to lack of fuel for an entry burn. As NASA expected its nuclear reactor to last several minutes before running out of uranium, no astronauts were put into SCP-83's capsule until 1966.</p><p>SCP-83 itself consists of two distinct parts: a metal exterior resembling aluminum and a smaller, sealed chamber within which are several objects recovered from Atlantis' flooded city ruins. SCP-83 functioned primarily as a nuclear propulsion system; its interior chamber contained several large, round chambers filled with various materials arranged in a cylindrical formation around a central, nuclear reactor at their top. Atop these chambers were black boxes containing complex instruments used to monitor the nuclear reactor's input and output levels in real time.</p><p>These hollow cylinders are made out of a substance resembling rubber or oil; no damage or deterioration has been detected over the years since its initial construction. The object closest to the outside of SCP-83 is a large box labeled "SHUTTLE", which contains four solar panels and an onboard computer that could be used as a navigational information system without needing any other input from Earth (with some modifications). Attached to the inside walls of SCP-83 are several pieces of printed circuit board; these boards appear to have originated from 1965 or later, although it is unknown whether they were added before or after NASA retired Project Orion.</p><p>Additionally, there are several sheets printed with text in Martian hieroglyphics. These sheets are continuous and covered in writing that corresponds with what appears to be ancient Martian hieroglyphics from at least 500Â BCE up until the time that Project Orion ceased operations on Mars.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong> On January 13th, 1971, the second and third crews of Project Orion landed on Mars, each making contact with the other crew in orbit. The first crew consisted of astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders; the second crew was led by Neil Armstrong and included Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins, and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin Jr. Due to the deteriorating conditions on Mars, NASA decided to abort Project Orion and return the astronauts to Earth. The capsule containing SCP-83 was recovered from the Martian surface and brought back to NASA\'s Kennedy Space Center. When opened, SCP-83 was found to contain no evidence of a nuclear reactor; rather, there were several large cylinders within SCP-83 that were analyzed as being made of rubber or oil.']</p>
