<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-263</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe (Generated</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-263 ("Lost Worlds") is to be contained in an aquarium of standard size, located in a specialized containment lock. The water level is to be maintained at one meter (1m) above the floor. SCP-263 is to be fed on a bi-annual basis with fish of the same size as its own creatures, and undergo regular health checks.</p><p>The tank itself is to be covered with two meters of sand, on top of which a layer of broken glass is to be placed. The ceiling of the containment chamber is to be reinforced with steel mesh, as well as a special locking mechanism for the door. All equipment used for testing SCP-263 must remain within the chamber, including any testing drones or security personnel. As no more than one researcher at a time is allowed in the containment chamber, only one researcher may perform testing with SCP-263 at any one time. Any data regarding properties not recorded during testing with SCP-263 are not to be considered valid data.</p><p>A small patrol team is to remain on standby outside of the containment chamber at all times, continuously monitoring for unauthorized entry. Any unauthorized persons attempting to enter the containment chamber are to be forcibly evicted via non-lethal force, and reported for disciplinary hearing by Site Command.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-263 appears to be a two meter long and one meter tall partially translucent creature resembling a peppermint with blue, transparent wings. It has not been observed to physically interact with anything other than its own creatures, as it will only eat them and otherwise remain completely still while they do so.</p><p>SCP-263 appears to have no visible eyes or ears, but instead is able to sense things through the "aura" of said beings around it. It has been observed to use this sense of "aura" to find edible creatures, which it then eats. Due to its highly advanced hearing, SCP-263 can even detect sounds inaudible to the human ear.</p><p>SCP-263's wings animate and expand when receiving positive feelings from its "creatures". SCP-263 endeavors to ensure that all its creatures are happy, as indicated by an intense euphoria surrounding them when being fed. SCP-263 is also extremely protective towards these beings, essentially giving its life for them. When asked how exactly it came into being, SCP-263 stated that it was originally the sole inhabitant on an unknown world, but was made to be created from most sentient beings when a large meteor fell on its world several million years ago. It does not understand how this could have happened, but is content at being the guardian of all it has created.</p><p>SCP-263 is extremely intelligent, as demonstrated by observations of it designing complex buildings and devices; however, it appears unable to interact directly with things outside of its anomalous powers. It seemed surprised when shown images of humans in science fiction films such as Star Wars, claiming that they did not exist on its planet before the meteor hit.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-263 was first discovered in 1997 after the Foundation received an anonymous phone call from a Foundation contact. The caller said that he believed that the Foundation had the ability to create something similar to SCP-263:</p><p>I want you to come over to my house and show me something. I think I know what it is. If you can make it happen, I\'ll give you what you want.</p><p>After performing preliminary research, Site Command realized that the anomalous being referred to as SCP-263 may actually be a version of itself, existing on another world (or "worlds").</p><p>The Foundation has since created a handheld device capable of instantaneously transporting personnel between worlds. This device, -CATALOGUE-, can teleport any individual to any location within the visible spectrum; however, it cannot be used to transport individuals to locations outside of the visible spectrum. The Foundation has not yet been able to find a way to teleport individuals into the invisible spectrum.</p><p>The Foundation currently uses this device to send personnel to worlds with similar creatures, which have been designated as Class A SCPs. These worlds are then explored and further studied in order to further understand the nature of SCP-263.']</p>
