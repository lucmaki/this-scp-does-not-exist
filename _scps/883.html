<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-883</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-883 is to be contained in an isolated area with a minimum of 30 square metres of floor space, maximum of 90 sq. m. An area of at least 5 sq. m will be used for the cultivation of suitable vegetation and the setting up of a watering system. A single goat is to be assigned to SCP-883 and provided with enough food and water to sustain it over the course of its containment period. The feeding schedule will be adjusted if needs change during said period, but should ensure that no more than 60% of the food consumed by SCP-883 is wasted.</p><p>Daily inspections are required to ensure that SCP-883 continues to feed on relevant plants; any non-relevant plants or other animals found within SCP-883's area are to be removed. Feeding schedules are to be amended as required when new plants are introduced into SCP-883's containment area or old ones removed from SCP-883's area. At all times, personnel assigned to this task must avoid contact with SCP-883 under any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-883 is a goat, as evidenced by its horns and ears. These extremities are rigid, and SCP-883 does not appear to be able to bend them at will. In addition, SCP-883's upper body does not seem to be able to move at all.</p><p>SCP-883 appeared via a non-anomalous portal in the middle of ████████, Australia on ██/██/20██, where it was initially observed by [DATA EXPUNGED]. When it exited its portal, SCP-883 possessed all of the abilities described in this document. It has since been observed ingesting plants and other materials around its containment area in an attempt to survive; no outside sources have been found to provide SCP-883 with sustenance.</p><p>SCP-883 exhibits extreme aggression towards personnel assigned to maintain it; primarily men due to the difficulty in avoiding contact with it. Most of these incidents are resolved with the termination of SCP-883. The only exception is when a staff member will momentarily appear within its field of vision during feeding or otherwise, causing SCP-883 to stop what they were doing and stare directly at that individual for over thirty seconds before resuming their task. Only on one occasion has this "glare" been enough for personnel to avoid death; after seeing a previously non-existent goat levitate above the ground without being touched, appropriate action was taken by Foundation staff.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
