<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-963</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Site-963 is to be located in the desert of western Nevada. A perimeter fence and security cameras have been installed around the facility, with ground sensors placed around the perimeter of the site.</p><p>The interior of Site-963 has been outfitted with a security system that records all personnel entering and exiting the building. Personnel are to contact Site-963 for permission before entering the basement section of the building.</p><p>All personnel traveling into or out of Site-963 will be observed by Foundation agents. If any evidence of SCP-963's anomalous effects or physical presence are detected, they are to be reported immediately to Site-963 staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-963 is a phenomenon that affects all personnel who enter Site-963. SCP-963 appears as a manifestation of Bob, a humanoid entity resembling an obese child with a bald head, large glasses, and white gloves.</p><p>SCP-963 will manifest itself in any area where a conscious being is present. SCP-963 will not appear in any location where no living organism is present; for example, SCP-963 will not appear at the entrance to Site-963 or inside the building. If SCP-963 appears elsewhere, it will disappear upon the appearance of any non-Anomalous beings.</p><p>SCP-963's appearance is only apparent to those who are thought of or focused on at the time of its manifestation; if no one is focused on, they will not see anything. However, if someone enters Site-963 while thinking about SCP-963, it may affect them.</p><p>If someone is thought about or focused on, and then enters Site-963 while being affected by SCP-963, they will experience effects consistent with those seen when someone else is affected by SCP-963. These effects include:</p><p>SCP-963 was first discovered in [REDACTED], Nevada during Foundation property acquisition efforts. The property was owned by ██████ ██████████████ (see Incident Report 963-A), and contained remnants of his anomalous property holdings. This included an abandoned warehouse and several abandoned buildings near the warehouse containing various items related to his anomalous activities.</p><p>The warehouse had been locked for some time and contained no signs of entry other than through the stairwell. The door to the central basement room was open, but several unopened boxes were stacked against it. All boxes were labeled "Bob's Itch". When approached by Foundation agents, Bob manifested before them and explained that he used to work for ██████████████ and that he would like nothing more than for his former employer to go extinct.</p>
