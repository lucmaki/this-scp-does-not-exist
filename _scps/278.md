<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-278</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-278 is suspended in a soundproofed room at the center of Site-201. A network of four cable spools and a counterweight are required for its containment. The room's door must be kept locked at all times, with only two persons allowed inside at any one time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-278 is a magnetic spinning disk of unidentified composition, measuring approximately 1m in diameter and 12cm thick. Its surface is composed of extremely smooth and reflective metal. SCP-278 is suspended horizontally in the center of an unadorned concrete room with a ceiling height of 4 meters.</p><p>When any person other than the current custodian attempts to pick up SCP-278 with their bare hand, it will move erratically until settling upon the palm. Once this occurs, SCP-278 will attempt to burrow into the palm of the subject, reaching a maximum depth of 2cm before retracting within seconds. If left for over 15 minutes, SCP-278 will begin to slowly burrow within the user's body despite no apparent injuries being sustained.</p><p>SCP-278 was recovered from [REDACTED] in ████████, Florida on █/█/2005 after Foundation agents were alerted to police reports informing them that local children displaying unusual behavior had been admitted to hospital emergency rooms all across town. The Foundation's Mobile Task Force Mu-4 responded, investigated reports that multiple subjects were being treated for self-inflicted knife wounds and returned to the local police station for interrogation which confirmed the anomalous nature of SCP-278.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum-1:</strong> On ██/██/2006, SCP-278 was reclassified as Euclid.']</p>
