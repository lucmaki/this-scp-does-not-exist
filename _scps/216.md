<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-216</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-216 is to be kept in a climate-controlled storage locker in Site-23. No other testing with SCP-216 is to occur. Any feedback from SCP-216, as well as its effect on the surrounding environment, are to be reported immediately to the current Site Director, Dr. █████, or any other Level 3 personnel in site contact.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-216 is a 1955 Mercury Montclair, bearing the registration ████. The vehicle has been modified to be self-driving, but otherwise fully operational. No trace of the driver has ever been found. Initial examination of SCP-216 showed no anomalous properties other than the lack of any in-car controls.</p><p>SCP-216 is capable of autonomous driving at speeds exceeding 70 km/h (45 m/s). However, the propulsion system is incapable of providing enough force to push it over 70 kph (45.84 mph) under normal conditions. In addition, SCP-216 is incapable of accelerating past 72 km/h (45.89 mph), regardless of conditions. While this behavior may seem similar to that of an ordinary car its motion is much more erratic and unpredictable, giving it leeway to move as fast as possible while avoiding moving hazards with uncanny accuracy. This behavior has been noted by drivers on multiple occasions during testing, though drivers have reported feeling less discomfort from SCP-216 than from other vehicles they have driven.</p><p>If a human test subject (i.e., a passenger) is seated in SCP-216, it will begin driving for maximum speed and force until it reaches its destination and stops. For SCP-216 to stop, its occupants must be removed or the car must come to a complete halt by itself. If the driver is removed from SCP-216 prior to reaching their destination, SCP-216 will continue driving upwards until it hits a ceiling or other obstacle and stops moving forward altogether; if this happens then the only way to stop SCP-216 is via physical means or via an external force such as explosives capable of causing blunt trauma sufficient to damage or destroy internal drive elements.</p><p>Once on their intended destination, the occupants will always exit via an external exit consisting of two doors which are identical in design and position relative to one another. These doors are not locked in any way and do not appear on any official government maps - though their locations can be detected by GPS tracking when using satellite imagery from a specific location known to be used by the Foundation for top secret work or testing purposes without needing to use Area-51's coordinates or any other area well known in public knowledge as Area-51's location.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-216 is capable of uncovering and driving through compartments in any building or underground facility such as cellars and subways, providing the driver is seated in SCP-216. The only way to prevent this is to seal off the room or compartment beforehand or to use a different car as the driver.']</p>
