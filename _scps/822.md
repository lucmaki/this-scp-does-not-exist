<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-822</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-822 are to be stored in Containment Locker 27 at Site-██. No fewer than 50 instances of SCP-822 are under Foundation control.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-822 is a set of 11 keys, each labeled with a different number. Instances of SCP-822 display no anomalous properties until 2021, when each instance becomes inert and begins to manifest itself as a usable key for a nearby object or building. The number printed on the key matches the number printed in ink on the object it unlocks. All anomalous properties are stored within the object itself and are not transferable, though SCP-822 instances retain all their properties after immobility and storage.</p><p>SCP-822 has been measured to unlock objects 1 km away. A simple container containing SCP-822 instances was moved through 1/3rd of an available space within Site-██, before becoming demanifest inside of another site ██ kilometers away, requiring an additional ██ kilometers of travel to rediscover the original site. For approximate values on its volume, refer to Experiment Log 522.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 822.1:</strong> Experiment Log 522</p><p>On ██/██/2021, an SCP-822 instance was placed on a table in the center of a room, and three containers were placed on either side of it. The other containers contained large numbers of various items (including several anomalous ones) ranging from 1 to 2 meters in size. The containers on either side of the SCP-822 instance were emptied by remote control, with the contents being deposited into the table's center. The container on the right contained a human male, who was removed and placed in a nearby humanoid containment cell. All items within the table were then used to vote on the fate of the subject.</p><p>The following is a log of events that occurred during Experiment Log 522:</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-5221</p><p><strong>Item Contained:</strong> One (1) SCP-2523, one (1) SCP-106, one (1) SCP-███</p><p><strong>Vote:</strong> D-5221 to be terminated by lethal injection.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The results of this experiment have been canceled by General ███████. Further testing will not be conducted until further notice.</p><p>Experiment Log 522 is hereby terminated."]</p>
