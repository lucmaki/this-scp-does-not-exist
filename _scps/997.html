<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-997</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-997 is to be stored in its case at Site-██. All testing of SCP-997 must be approved by Level 2 personnel with Level 3 authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-997 is a small glass bottle containing approximately one pint of liquid. The bottle is opaque, and is composed of a clear glass material with no markings to indicate its origin or contents.</p><p>The substance within SCP-997 is impossible to analyze. It appears to be normal water within the chemical composition of a human body, but has shown no anomalous properties in any testing performed on it. If a human being drinks from SCP-997, they will immediately become intoxicated with no discernable cause.</p><p>Drinking from SCP-997 for an extended period of time causes the subject to experience a temporary state of euphoria and hallucinations, with the rate of intoxication increasing with each pint consumed.</p><p>The effects of becoming intoxicated by SCP-997 cease if the subject ceases drinking from the bottle, though the subject will begin to feel withdrawal symptoms after several days without ingesting the liquid. A standard urine test will always return negative for alcohol, indicating that the subject's body is not using any alcohol for energy.</p><p>Subjects who have consumed significant amounts of SCP-997 are capable of predicting when SCP-997 will stop affecting them based upon their own internal physiology. Subjects will also report feelings of discomfort when they are unable to consume more SCP-997.</p><p>Subjects have reported a sense of apprehension when they must consume another pint of SCP-997, as the effects will begin almost immediately after finishing the last pint.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
