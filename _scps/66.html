<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-66</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-66 is currently held in a Type 4 Containment Cell. The containment cell is to be fashioned after a standard human cell of the same size, but with a large amount of reinforced steel bars set at 0.8m intervals. In addition to the eight guards who are to rotate shifts three times daily, two guards are required on duty twenty-four hours a day. No more than one guard is allowed to enter the chamber at any given time, and all subjects are to remain within the chamber until released.</p><p>Twenty (20) minutes before the regular 2012 solar eclipse, 180mm x 180mm cyan MOA plates are to be removed from the front and back of SCP-66's cell at an individual position. A subject is then to enter the chamber and stand in front of the plate while claiming this as its terminal location; this object will then act as a medium for SCP-66. SCP-66 will then begin speaking directly into the subject's ears; this process should take between 10 to 15 minutes until SCP-66 deactivates after uttering its final message.</p><p>As of 05/27/2011, a Foundation-sponsored acoustical engineering study has concluded that the voices heard by subjects during this process should not be able to be reproduced using closest available technology, such as those found in conventional enclosed sound booths or residential rooms. Attempts to capture said voice through long distance recording systems have met with similar failure.</p><p>When all conversation with SCP-66 has ceased, ACOG personnel will move onto line of sight with SCP-66 and activate infrared spotlights attached to rifles at points on SCP-66's midsection at close range in order to provide additional illumination. This process must be executed again once five minutes have passed due to the brief phase change caused by the eclipse occurring in the next five minutes (See Addendum 66-01). At no time should ACOG personnel approach within three hundred (300) meters of the center mass of SCP-66 unless incapacitated.</p><p>If subjects do have failed attempts made by actioned subjects become disabled or in some way incapable of moving away from their initial position, MTF agents must immediately flank as close as possible and proceed towards the chest cavity of SCP-66 with specialized tools. Once located, one officer must place a probe directly into the subject and place them in seated position against a wall using his foot as resistance force; this action must take under ten seconds and be performed accurately by only one officer. Once completed, they are then instructed to begin CPR and remain still until assistance arrives. Rescuers should also explain that all subjects affected by SCP-66 should continue breathing normally regardless of their current state, and that any subjects who are already unconscious must be placed into a supine position on the ground and paramedics called immediately (All bodily functions will continue functioning normally.)</p><p>Once paramedics have arrived along with two armed tactical specialists, access points between 55mm x 55mm x 345mm iron bars located within 5mm of each other at equal distances throughout SCP-66's entire body should be accessed using a nonmagnetic object capable of penetrating through up to thirty (30) millimeters of concrete such as forceps or park rangers batons to gain access into SCP-66's thoracic cavity through openings in its rib cage. Inside these openings is where a majority of its vital organs are located including its heart and lungs, which have been observed decomposing upon exposure to air outside the body yet only decay dramatically inside the body due mainly in large part to an extremely high rate of respiration attained by all levels inside its internal organs.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-66 is a humanoid of exceptionally pale hue, standing approximately two meters in height with a weight of 200kg. SCP-66's form is composed predominantly of an orange flesh tone, but can be further differentiated according to the ratio of orange to black facial coloring and the extent of yellowing it has. Its upper body is a uniform shade of white though this fades into an orange shade at its hands and feet. All coloration on SCP-66's clothing is a pale grey tone, but again this will fade into that of orange at its elbows and knees. All individual parts of SCP-66's appendages are composed largely of dark brown leather with traces of metallic rivulets running through them; these portions were specifically analyzed by Foundation biological personnel to determine their composition.</p><p>The left arm of SCP-66 begins at its elbow, where it becomes a well defined vas deferens which eventually gives way to another branch before ending at the palm. From here, it splits into three sections before separating into one single vein and connecting with SCP-66's left hand which is composed entirely of a deep red flesh tone similar to that found in humans who have recently been kissed. From there, the veins continue as branched tubes inside SCP-66's wrist which come together at its palms before continuing as tubes throughout SCP-66's entire upper arm including the creation and insertion of four tendons which culminate at halfway points within SCP-66's elbow. The final pipe within this portion comes together in the area between SCP-66's elbow and hand to create a vein which ends at the base of the second finger (Management note: These four tendons were identified as such because they were nearly completely black in color when photographed.)</p><p>The right arm begins similarly in the same vein as the other arm with numerous connectors present evenly throughout, but after a few inches it separates from the rest of the forearm and turns 90Â° counterclockwise before continuing as an identical structure except on the other side. The end result is an identical vein to that found in the left arm reaching all the way up to around mid forearm on both sides except with two additional connections atop each shoulder before splitting once more into three smaller vessels on top of each shoulder.</p><p>These four veins are then split into two sets running parallel with each other over part of both arms along with distribution tubes branching out from form about 3/4ths down both arms. This is what leads up to what appears to be iconic human skinning tools surrounding first one half then another portion almost all the way up from end finger tip until close to neck area where they separate seemingly for no reason (See Photo 0.) These tools appear to be artificial and have been confirmed through testing as being made of porcelain and iron respectively.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 66-01:</strong></p><p>On 07/04/2011, the following message was discovered in a journal kept by SCP-66 and has been transcribed for this document.</p><p>I cannot let you succeed. You are an abomination. I cannot allow you to be given life. You have my approval on this matter. And so I give you these words to live by.</p><p>This was all that was ever found in the journal; it is unknown if there was any more from SCP-66.</p><p>A message from the creature inside me. From me. A message to mankind.</p>
