<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-491</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation maintains a database entry for SCP-491. The Foundation is not currently aware of any other instances of SCP-491.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-491 is a video game created by █████ █████. The general title appears as: "Raccoon Encouragement", with the copyright holder indicated as "PD32000".</p><p>SCP-491 is sold independently on several online marketplaces, including [REDACTED]. SCP-491 requires a Windows PC to function normally.</p><p>When one plays SCP-491, they will encounter a hooded Raccoon (hereafter referred to as SCP-491-A) who will offer helpful advice and encouragement. Given the presence of other non-anomalous raccoon video games, there appears to be no discernable pattern in which SCP-491 will appear. There has never been any hostile behavior from SCP-491-A.</p><p>SCP-491 does not affect its player in any way beyond offering them assistance. In addition, SCP-491 does not have any discernable effect on the player's behavior or cognition. However, analysis of gameplay logs have found that players experience increased attention towards the game, such that they do not notice time passing while playing.</p><p>Only one instance of SCP-491 is known to exist currently, with it located in Site ██'s containment room.</p><p>The Foundation has no knowledge of how SCP-491 came to be originally created, or if its creator possessed other instances of SCP-491 at the time of writing this document.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-491 was originally discovered by Agent ██████, who was investigating reports of anomalous video games. After three days of gameplay, he discovered that the game had changed in some way.</p><p>When he asked SCP-491-A for help, SCP-491-A replied with a statement saying "I\'m happy to help, but there\'s no need for that. I\'ll be right here to help you whenever you need it."</p><p>At this point, Agent ██████ became convinced that SCP-491 had become sentient. He then began playing the game until he was reported as missing by his colleagues, and received a written reprimand from Dr. ████. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Dr. ████ ordered that SCP-491-A be placed into containment.</p><p>Currently, SCP-491 is being kept at Site ██\'█ containment chamber. SCP-491-A has been observed on multiple occasions offering assistance to personnel within Site ██. When asked, SCP-491-A has refused to participate in any other interviews with Foundation personnel.']</p>
