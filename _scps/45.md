<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-45</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-45 is stored in the High Security Containment Locker in Site 19. SCP-45 is to be treated as any other high-velocity meteorite and observed for potential SCP-45-1 manifestations.</p><p>Prompt amnestic administration is to be administered to all witnesses as soon as possible following an event. All social media activity regarding SCP-45, including photos and videos, are to be monitored closely by the staff of the Internet Task Force. Media outlets have been instructed to avoid reports on objects, phenomena, or events which could give rise to similar incidents of SCP-45.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-45 is a small meteorite composed of iron with an estimated mass of 5 kg. It has a round shape, and has a composition very similar to iron meteorites from the [REDACTED] asteroid belt. SCP-45 displays no unusual physical properties. It has a degree of oxidation; its surface is peppered with organic matter which appears to have been caused by bacteria.</p><p>SCP-45 does not appear anywhere in the solar system, neither on Earth's surface nor on any other celestial body within 150 million km at the present time.1 SCP-45 is nearly identical in composition and appearance to any iron meteorite found on Earth, except that it experiences extremely high rates of velocity in relation to the speed at which it is located. The maximum possible velocity detected was ██ km/s, yet SCP-45 approached the surface at just over 1 km/s.</p><p>When an object of similar size and composition to SCP-45 is observed anywhere within 150 million km of Earth's surface (within one hour), it will appear directly overhead for three seconds, then disappear without a trace within 10 seconds. After this initial appearance, it will be impossible to detect SCP-45 until its second appearance approximately 41 hours later (following as long as two hours after first contact). During this period, witnesses may report that they are able to see SCP-45 moving through space itself rather than being located or relocating in conjunction with the rest of the solar system. Although there are clear differences between actual motion caused by SCP-45 and the motions of objects outside Earth's gravity well, most observers perceive them as simply "moving" along with SCP-45 in its path.</p><p>In addition to physical effects, there are also no less severe psychological effects detectable as a result of contact with SCP-45. In almost all cases, observers will describe feeling stressed, nervous, and fearful during their observations; many become physically ill after being exposed to SCP-45. Observers have reported blinding headaches and even hallucinations when viewing SCP-45 for extended periods of time; some have become suicidal after having observed SCP-45 repeatedly for more than two hours at a time. Media reports describing these effects have triggered incidents similar to those caused by SCP-45 itself. Pathological events exhibited by those experiencing psychological effects range from minor panic attacks and sleeplessness to full psychotic breakdowns from the induction of traumatic events such as sexual assault and murder. Although Foundation staff are attempting to identify an impact pattern that could enable temporal prediction based on previous observations, thus far no pattern or pattern "profile" has been linked directly to actual recurrence of an event despite repeated observations during multiple observation windows.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum SCP-45-1:</strong> SCP-45 has been found to be the source of certain anomalous phenomena which have been observed during its appearances. These events occur only when SCP-45 is observed; they do not occur if it is not observed at all.']</p>
