<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-475</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-475 is currently contained at Site-19. Any civilian who has had contact with SCP-475 is to be detained and interrogated about the entity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-475 is a humanoid entity composed of multiple copies of the same person. These individuals describe a common history and experience, but can and will interrupt this narrative at any time in order to further the current SCP-475 narrative. Observations indicate that the entity's memories are limited and thus not able to recall information about itself.</p><p>SCP-475 first came to Foundation interest following a series of disappearances from an isolated town in [REDACTED]. This incident was referenced as 'The Exploitation Incident' by local authorities, who were quoted as saying 'All of our missing persons suddenly turned up at their homes'.</p><p>Later investigation revealed that several transient class personnel had been living temporarily in the town during their missions. One individual described the entity as 'a little weird', and stated that it had never been violent or violent towards them despite their attempts to interact with it. The last recorded sighting of this individual indicated that they had been assaulted by an unknown assailant; photographs taken at the scene indicated that the individual had most likely been terminated before reaching a hospital. Local authorities estimate between 40-60 deaths during this incident.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 475-1:</strong> Attempts to record the entity's memories have proven unsuccessful, with the following being extracted from Foundation agents and operatives who have interacted with SCP-475:</p><p>The XK Incident</p><p>The entity was asked about its purported role in the XK Incident, and responded that it was a 'sociology experiment' for the Foundation - an explanation which is also referenced by the entity in later communications.</p><p>The Foundation of SCP-477</p><p>The entity frequently refers to itself as a 'member of the Foundation', and this has been confirmed by Foundation personnel.</p><p>Logo Design Contest</p><p>SCP-475 was asked to design a logo for the Foundation in return for a snack. The entity agreed, and subsequently drew a logo which was approved by Dr. █████.</p><p>The document containing the results of this competition is currently stored at Site-19."]</p>
