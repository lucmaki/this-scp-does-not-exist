<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-385</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-385 is contained within the underground regions of ████ Marine Terminal in New York Harbor. A direct helicopter-drop access to SCP-385 is to be installed and maintained. SCP-385 is to be surrounded by a debris fence of minimum height 2 m, with a perimeter of 3 km. The installation is to be guarded by two HMDS personnel on duty at all times for security purposes. All personnel entering the tunnels are subject to search and are required to wear approved SCPs-385 rubber suits at all times. Any personnel exiting SCP-385 after it has been brought under its containment must also be accompanied by one HMDS member on guard duty.</p><p>In addition, a nearby cover story regarding the existence of "New York Greens" as an alternative means of transportation to and from Manhattan is to be disseminated among the general public. Any individuals who attempt to enter SCP-385 are to be administered Class B amnestics.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-385 is a 4-level underground transportation system consisting of a main terminal building, discrete cargo area, decontamination and air filtration area, and maintenance and habitation zone. The facility is equipped with an array of electromechanical equipment that allows it to function in an isolated fashion without the need for manual servicing or replacement. There appears to be no conceivable way of disabling or destroying SCP-385 given its large size, as well as its protective armor coating.</p><p>SCP-385 has a very high degree of compartmentalization and self-sufficiency. The interior of SCP-385 is furnished with a wide range of amenities, including modern furniture, entertainment systems, lighting fixtures, art works, computer terminals, and even recreational drugs in the form of "New York Greens". While SCP-385 can be accessed from several points within New York Harbor, it is currently located underneath the ground at the ████ Marine Terminal location within the New York Harbor Metro Tunnel.</p><p>SCP-385's entrance is surrounded by a two meter tall steel wall capable of stopping hand held explosives. A security camera system is in place at all entrances which record the identity and reason for each individual entering SCP-385. Said recording devices record data through closed circuit surveillance (CCS) cameras beneath the floor; due to their highly advanced nature they are not viewable by non D-Class personnel and do not have any effect on visual acuity.</p><p>SCP-385 itself consists of three sections: The Main Terminal Building (MTF), Cargo Area (CA), and Decontamination Area (DA). The MTF section serves as the equivelant to an airline terminal, wherein transport vehicles board passengers via vehicle lift installed on one side of the room. Passengers then proceed through into the CA section where they complete their travel needs before exiting back into New York Harbor via a drop hatch on the opposite end of the room. Upon reentering New York Harbor proper all personnel are subject to random drug testing upon reentrance into New York Harbor but this is unknown if this procedure was enforced consistently throughout its operation.</p><p>The DA serves as a decontamination facility exclusive to members of SCP-385 who arrive in this section after traveling through SCP-385's CA section. This area is furnished with showers, toilets, linens and foodstuffs for those entering here after their arrival has been completed; human waste produced by SCPs-385 travelers are collected here and disposed of via incineration. Storage facilities holding biological waste from SCP-385 travelers are situated adjacent to this section.</p><p>There have been approximately 3,800 recorded attempts at entry/exiting SCP-385 so far (see Incident Log 385-A for details). Of these recorded entries/exits, ~17% were aborted shortly before completion due to emergencies such as fire or structural damage to SCP-385's entrance point(s), ~13% were aborted due to swarming activity from multiple instances of SCP-███ living within the tunnels (see Incident Log 385-B for details), ~10% were aborted due to hazardous chemical contamination in CA portion (see Incident Log 385-C for details), ~3% were aborted because they could not determine how they were supposed to enter/exit (see Incident Log 385-D for details), and ~36% were aborted due to circumstances unknown but believed to be related to anomalous properties occurring during travel between CA/DA units of SCP-385. The remaining 16% successfully completed their assigned task(s) while inside SCP-385 without further failure or complication reported to date.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, the Foundation discovered that a large number of the individuals attempting to enter SCP-385 were being held in custody at the ████ Marine Terminal by [REDACTED] . The contents of this section are to be withheld from all personnel under penalty of death.']</p>
