<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-894</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-894 is to be kept in a climate controlled chamber with dim lighting until it has reached maturity, after which time it is to be moved back into the same chamber. The chamber must have a clear view of any incoming airspace into the Foundation's containment area.</p><p>SCP-894 is to be fed once per day. Any spilled or wasted food is to be removed from the containment area and incinerated using standard pyrotechnic techniques.</p><p>When SCP-894 becomes adult, it may be released from the containment area for up to two hours of flight time each day. This release may only occur in an open hangar at Site-19.</p><p>Afterward, SCP-894 must be returned back into its containment area. Any attempt by SCP-894 to exit the containment area without authorization will result in termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-894 is a moth of the genus Heliothis, commonly called a "ladybug." It is approximately ten centimeters long, with a wingspan of close to twenty centimeters. SCP-894 has wide wings with a primary coloration resembling that of the Japanese Cherry Blossom.</p><p>SCP-894 is docile and nervous, and remains sedentary unless startled or threatened in any way. SCP-894 shows no interest in leaving its containment area, saying it is unable to do so and will not attempt to do so until it is adult. It is currently believed that SCP-894 either cannot or chooses not to leave its cell due to its lack of wings.</p><p>SCP-894 generates a strong electrical charge through its wings. This can be sensed by any person within about six meters of the moth at all times. When SCP-894 exerts itself, the charge will also flow through other forms of matter nearby, such as concrete floors, cinderblocks, and even persons themselves.</p><p>While SCP-894 hovers in place, it will make loud ticking noises from its wings and abdomen. While this occurs, it shows signs of discomfort and agitation.</p><p>When friendly individuals come into direct contact with SCP-894, they will feel a pleasurable sensation for several seconds before being paralyzed for exactly three minutes by the electrical charge running through their bodies. This paralysis does not affect their limbs. After this happens once or twice, they will enter an altered state of consciousness while helplessly moving along with SCP-894's flight path into an uncharted location designated Site-19. In these cases, information suggesting that Site-19 is near the location where they normally reside will appear on the surfaces they access; any attempts to remove the information by their homes have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-894 was initially discovered in ████. During a routine site visit, the Foundation noticed that Site-19 was missing. A search of the nearby area revealed a new facility constructed to resemble Site-19. A large moth resembling SCP-894 was found nearby, and it was subsequently captured. Further investigation into the facility revealed an unknown entity using it as its base of operations, as well as several other moths resembling SCP-894. The entity, designated SCP-894B, was neutralized with the use of Class-A amnestics and their respective moth specimens were returned to containment.</p>
