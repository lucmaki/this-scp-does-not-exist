<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-390 is a male of estimated Caucasian descent, aged 25. Subject does not respond to his name and does not acknowledge the presence of guards or researchers in any way. His behaviour when approached by security personnel is to be vague, disinterested and non-responsive to questions regarding his identity or location.</p><p>Subject has been observed to react with disdain at attempts to interview him, and will often become hostile and attempt to assault guards attempting access to his cell.</p><p>Subject was found on ██/██/1968 as a 16 year old juvenile in ████████, ██████, after reports were raised that he had been hired as an electrician on a low wage rate. Subject had been reported missing by ████████████ prior to this incident. According to investigation reports, subjects parents' home was burned down several days earlier by the British Provisional Irish Republican Army [PIGS], and subject had not participated in the event.</p><p>Investigation Report: SCP-390 is aloof towards any form of investigation offered or requested, but shows a preference for classical literature such as Jane Austen, John Ruskin and William Morris. Subjects dedication to literature is unparalleled in mental health facilities currently operating within the United Kingdom.</p><p>Through reading material provided by facility staff, SCP-390 has shown minimal interest in politics or current events affecting Britain's Anglo-Celtic ethnocentric racial groups. Instead subjects main interests have revolved around fictional authors such as William Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats.</p><p>Interview Log 390-A</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr █████: Good evening Mr Robinson</p><p>SCP-390: Evening Dr █████</p><p>Dr █████: What are your hobbies? Your favourite books? I've noticed you read quite a lot.</p><p>SCP-390: I was enjoying my leisure time before… (subject begins to cry) Can I talk now?</p><p>Dr █████: Of course, what would you like to discuss?</p><p>SCP-390: My girlfriend… The last time they took me out…. She was pregnant… They killed their own kid! No one sees it but them! They just don't get it! They can't see it! But it's there! You see it too! It's there… They kill people and eat their own babies! How could you stand there and watch!? What kind of mother kills her child!? And why did no one do anything about it!? No one stood up for them! No one cared! No one knows what it's like to have your own child taken from you and slaughtered! You don't know what it's like! You can't know what it's like! You don't understand our pain!! We are being slaughtered for no reason!! Why did we make so much hate inside ourselves? Why did we let them take everything we ever wanted?! We could be happy here!! We could be free here but we chose to hate people who aren't like us! Did we really have no choice?! Was there never a way out??? If there were maybe we would've done something differently… Anything different than what they made us do… We didn't realize what they were doing until it was too late.. They said they were going to free us but just look around you see all of young white men like me locked away with nothing more than a sense of possibility kept inside you! Was this REALLY freedom? Was this really what we wanted?! What did we do? Who did we become?! We never knew these things would come true.. We never thought this kind of thing could happen. We never could imagine that no matter how hard we try or how much our lives turn out exceptionally well nothing will ever change.. Our parents will always love us ……..But us… Do you even care anymore?? Was this love or was this just a coincidence?? How long can we keep pretending that every moment isn't terrifying enough for each of us?? I don't know what makes our lives better!! I don't know if anything could ever make me feel okay again…I'm scared I'm just so scared I wonder if everyone else feels the same way..I wonder if everyone thinks their life is better than ours in some ways.. Everyone seems so happy but me… why am I the only one who feels betrayed!? Why do I want revenge against people who deserve nothing less than death when all i want is justice against them? We could all live together.. Free from hate forever!! That's all I want isn't it?! Justice!! Just give me justice instead of passionless suffering filled with endless hostility isn't that possible? Isn't justice usually upheld every once in a while isn't it?! Isn't honor enough for any person regardless of race or religion let alone nationality?? How come people let laws go unfulfilled over and over again without taking any sort of action whatsoever??? We could live together peacefully without any wars or conflicts between each other…."Shut up Tommy.. Shut up I'm tired of hearing yourself"…"You wouldn't understand"…"Just shut up"…"Don't bring up my past"…"Why should i listen?"…"It's not fair"…"You're not living"…"Why should i listen?"…"Please just stop".. "I tried…." "Do you even care?" "Listen, please just listen" "Will anybody listen?" "Someone must stop him!!" "…Is nobody listening?!" "Can you hear me?" "No one cares anymore!!" "You wont understand until its too late." "What does that mean?" "…Let go Rob-" "…Donnelly quit trash talking me!" "Come on guys he stops talking doesn't mean anything!" "…How long does he have then?" "…I swear on my life that he won't be seeing tomorrow night" "…Why'd u do that robski!?"(subject begins crying anew) "-Your dead liar-" "…Jimmy can you close your eyes please?" "…My mouth is sealed" "(sighs)"(subject still crying…) <End Log></p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 390-1:</strong> On ██/█/1968, a suicide note was found in the possession of the deceased subject along with a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The note read as follows:</p><p>My name is Tommy Robinson I am so sorry I did what they told me to. But I couldn't let them make me do that…I couldn't be part of it. I tried to run away but they caught me and tortured me for days. They forced me to do things I didn't want to do. They made me watch people die! I couldn't take it anymore! Just give me justice! Please! Give me justice!! Please!?(subject begins crying) We are all so tired of living this way! It's been going on for so long and no one cares anymore!! It's too much! It's just too much! We can't take it anymore we will do what we must!! What do you want from us?! What do you want from us?! I don't know what you want from us but i swear that if you want something from us then give us your best shot at keeping us safe and free!! Yours or not we won't stop until we get what we want!!!(subject cries harder) I am so sorry my friends….I am so sorry please understand I did it because I love you all so much…(subject begins to cry) I did it because i needed you to understand that we are all tired of being locked up like animals, chained up and electrocuted while our own parents kill our children because they don't agree with them. They don't understand that we're just trying to make life better for everyone here but they keep killing each other over this stupid white supremacy bullshit nonsense! I know some people don't agree with this statement but i feel there needs to be a change and its happening now! If you think about it for one second you would know that if you ask yourself why we are all stuck here then the answer is clear… If the government can lock up people without trial just because they feel like it then that means anyone can. Anyone from anyone race! Anyone from any religion! Anyone from any nationality!! That means anyone can live here or be killed here!! This means anyone can live in England or be killed in England even if they aren't English! This means everyones rights are being taken away by the government just because they don't like someone!! Even if they are good people like us who care about everyone…even if they are good people like my girlfriend or my brother or my father or my friends…they can be locked up and killed just because they're different than you!! Just because they're white.. Just because they're British.. Just because they're Irish.. Just because they're Muslim or Jewish or Sikh or Jewish or whatever else their skin is maybe even black.. Just because their parents were born somewhere else in the world…just because their parents hate Britain more than you love them…just because their skin isn't white enough then they can be locked up, tortured, electrocuted, murdered and eaten just like any other person in this country!! We are sick of being treated like trash and we won't stand for it anymore! This doesn't mean everyone agrees with this statement but i will say one thing… Everyone loves their families more than anything else and no one wants to see the ones that love them get hurt! If anyone thinks i'm wrong about anything i have said then i wish that you were right so please? Please tell me how can i make things right again?? How can i make sure this doesn't happen anymore? How can i ensure that my family lives freely without fear<|"]</p>
