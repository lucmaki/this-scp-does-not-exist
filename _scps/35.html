<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-35</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The park with the stairway in question is to be monitored via webcams by SCP personnel. Any instances of SCP-35-1 are to be contained and transported to site security to be studied and removed as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-35 is a phenomenon occurring at ██████ Park in ███████████, TX. The phenomenon appears to occur every Sunday between 11AM and 1PM, with an average of 5-10 instances produced per day, although this number varies wildly.</p><p>The stairway in question is currently the only place where SCP-35 can be seen. Attempting to view the stairs from other areas of the park will result in a change in location for any nearby instances (i.e. to a balcony, a stairwell or open space). Instantaneous photographs taken from different points around the park will all show the same instance of SCP-35 when viewed from the same point.</p><p>Instances are not limited to the stairway at ██████ Park: They can be found elsewhere in and around town on any of the days that they occur, with no appearance pattern recorded.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-35 was documented on 11/02/2012, when a security camera in the stairwell of ██████ Park in ███████████, TX recorded an instance of SCP-35-1 attempting to climb up the stairs. The following is a transcript of the event:</p><p>An instance of SCP-35 appears in the stairwell. It is identified as instance 35-A.</p><p>Instance 35-A climbs up the stairs, and attempts to climb over the railing. It has one foot on top of the railing, when it falls over backwards and disappears. Instance 35-A reappears on the third floor landing.</p><p>Instance 35-A climbs over the railing and attempts to climb to the fourth floor. It climbs to the third level before falling over backwards again and disappearing. Instance 35-A reappears on the third floor landing.</p><p>Instance 35-A climbs up to the third floor and attempts to climb over the railing. It has one foot on top of the railing, but falls down again due to instability. Instance 35-A appears on the second level landing and climbs back down to the first floor.</p>
