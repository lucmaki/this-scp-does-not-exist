<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-316</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-316 is to be kept in a Standard Containment Locker at Site 43.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-316 is a white, vinyl refrigerator magnet in the shape of a small goldenrod. The addition of a piece of paper to SCP-316 opens up a feature by incorporating the words "For Goldenrod" written in blue ink. As of yet, this feature has never been tested.</p><p>When SCP-316 is attached to a person’s refrigerator, they will begin experiencing vivid nightmares relating to their demise at the hands of a black panther named ‘Goldenrod’, who invariably appears as either one or two black cats. The more times SCP-316 is used, the more intensely their dreams will become and the harder it is to convince them they are actually dreaming.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 316-1:</strong> On 2/17/2012, SCP-316 was officially integrated into containment procedures at Site 43. It is unknown when SCP-316 was released from its anomalous properties, but it can be assumed to have been done when the subject in question was no longer alive.</p>
