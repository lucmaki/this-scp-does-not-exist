<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-286</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-286 is surrounded by a perimeter fence 50 m (164 ft) in length and the internal cavity is filled with concrete. The area of the containment chamber containing SCP-286 can be accessed via elevator at the base of the containment shaft. Area 1 contains the entrance to SCP-286 and Area 2 is designated for extra security measures.</p><p>All reports of trespassers or unauthorized access to SCP-286 are investigated by Foundation personnel stationed at Area 2. Any unauthorized trespassing gets immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-286 is a humanoid male, approximately 1.75 m (5 ft) tall and weighing 50 kg (110 lb). SCP-286 wears a gray suit with brown shoes, black vest and tie and a fedora hat. Despite the commonly accepted belief of SCP-286's physical location, it is unknown where SCP-286 is in terms of space.</p><p>If an individual approaches SCP-286 and greets it, one of more following effects will occur:</p><p>SCP-286 suffers no adverse effects from these interactions, but refuses to answer questions regarding its origins or purpose. If the individual attempts any form of harm to SCP-286 during this process, it will refuse to continue the interaction for three days. During this period, SCP-286 will attempt to find the individual trespassing on its property.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum A:</strong></p><p>SCP-286 was discovered in a warehouse at ████████, Maine, USA. The owner of the warehouse had reported that an unidentified figure was living in an abandoned building in the basement for several months. When Foundation personnel investigated the premises, SCP-286 emerged from a hatch in the floor and attempted to exit with a box containing a large amount of books and papers. SCP-286 began speaking in an unknown language and repeatedly apologized for its presence. Documentation recovered from the box suggests SCP-286 believes it has lived in this location for the past 15 years.</p><p>After the initial incident, SCP-286 was transported to Site-██ and amnestics were administered to employees of the ████████ area. SCP-286 has since been contained at Area 2.</p>
