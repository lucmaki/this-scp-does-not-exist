<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-232</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-232 is to be contained in a steel case, lined with lead for added protection. Periodic cleaning will be required of the case; this includes inspection for any corrosion from the high pH levels of SCP-232. When not in use, SCP-232 should be stored in a secure location with its lid secured by a padlock.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-232 is a non-anomalous camera, of unknown age and manufacture. All elements are functional. The viewfinder displays a horizontal line stretching from the left to the right; the lens is capable of focusing on objects at any permanent distance. The shutter functions properly despite being bolted shut, and the film itself is unexposed.</p><p>The film inside SCP-232 is not a normal photographic film stock, but instead appears to be made of living tissue. The fleshy appearance of the film varies with each roll, but in every case possesses characteristics typical of human skin: elasticity, texture, and sensitivity to temperature changes, as well as its appearance changing upon exposure to visible light. Each roll also seems to produce an individual voice within the frame. A transcript follows:</p><p>Interrogation Transcript</p><p>[Begin Log]</p><p>Dr. █████: How long have you been sitting here?</p><p>SCP-232: We were coming back from… something… Remember? I’d like to eat now…</p><p>Dr. █████: You can’t do that here. I need answers. Sit up or I’ll sedate you again.</p><p>SCP-232: Oh! It was something we saw back when our parents first started taking us places. Didn’t you go see it last year?</p><p>Dr. █████: What was it?</p><p>SCP-232: It was a children’s show called… something… It was all made up! But it was so pretty! But there was this one artist who put powder on pictures so they would make sound! And then he ran away because his dad got pissed because he was making dendrites out of his house! Isn’t that funny? Dendrites! Dendrites everywhere! You should try it sometime! They sell them in all the vending machines in our town! They even write about them for us sometimes! You should try them sometime, yeah! That would be neat if we did that someday… eheh heh hhh…. Why are you looking at me like that? I didn’t do anything bad—Wait what’s happening here?</p><p>[End Log]</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> It has been determined that SCP-232 was originally a gift from the ██████ Foundation to its employees. However, it has since become impossible to trace the donor, or even whether the Foundation still exists. The Foundation has thus been unable to return the object to them.</p><p>Since acquiring the object, it has been found that only staff members are able to view the film inside. Attempts at re-containment have so far proven ineffective.</p>
