<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-469</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> An altar to SCP-469 is to be constructed in a Control Room, with physical access to the containment chamber being limited to Level 2 personnel. A copy of "The Life of St. Francis" translated into Gaelic is to be placed on the altar, and a small flame is to be kept lit at all times. No resources above level 2 clearance are to be used for research into the properties of SCP-469.</p><p>In the event that the Foundation has gained possession of a copy of "The Life of St. Francis" in any language, such copies are to be recovered, and further containment procedures implemented after consultation with a member of the O Council.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-469 is a spherical entity comprised of intersecting, overlapping polygonal surfaces. SCP-469's behavior is primarily related to intelligence, with the goal of "finding out what's on the other side".</p><p>SCP-469 appears to primarily communicate through light and heat, but may also use visual or auditory means to convey information. SCP-469 responds positively to those who perform actions that are above the ordinary, and reciprocally harms those who perform actions that are below the ordinary.</p><p>SCP-469 was originally discovered in 1966 in ██████, Italy, where it was observed attempting to interact with a statue of St. Francis. A report from the local bishop dated 1968 describes an event near ██████ in which every person present spontaneously experienced delusions indicating that they had been transported to [REDACTED], where St. Francis appeared before them and spoke to them for ██ days. The number of individuals involved was initially estimated at ███, but has since been revised upwards to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Several artifacts similar to SCP-469 have been recovered from the remains of individuals believed to have died during this period of time, although further analysis is not permitted due to potential security concerns.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 469-A:</strong> Secure storage of SCP-469 is prohibited.</p><p>Secure storage of SCP-469 is prohibited.</p>
