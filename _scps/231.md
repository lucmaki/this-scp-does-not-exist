<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-231</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-231 is to be housed in a standard containment locker. SCP-231's cover must remain closed at all times, and the object may not be removed from its containment locker without written approval from two (2) Level 3 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-231 is a cast iron pan, approximately 14 cm in diameter. The object itself appears to be in no way anomalous; however, the interior of the pan contains a doughy substance which is capable of being heated to a maximum temperature of 356°C without shattering or burning. This substance does not show any sign of aging or degradation from any cause.</p><p>When this substance is heated, it releases a signature aroma and flavor similar to Dunkin' Donuts coffee. When consumed by a human subject, the substance has been found to produce identical effects as coffee. However, while under the effect of SCP-231, subjects have shown extremely heightened physical and mental capabilities. These subjects exhibit extreme alertness, increased perception of time and space, increased reaction speed and reflexes, significantly enhanced memory retention, greatly reduced fatigue and sleepiness, rapid healing of minor injuries (such as cuts and burns), and increased resistance to pain.</p><p>Addled/Dazed: Subjects who ingest SCP-231 perceive time differently than those who do not consume SCP-231. While unaffected by SCP-231's effects, affected individuals will experience normal time flows (including day/night cycles) much more quickly than would be expected for an individual under normal circumstances (see Subjective Time Test Log).</p><p>Subjects will also experience additional doses of caffeine during the course of normal activities. In addition, given enough time with the substance present in their bodies, affected individuals have displayed strong and consistent compulsion to remain awake continuously in order to maintain its effects and prevent them from expiring from exhaustion. Continued consumption of SCP-231 by these subjects will cause their actions to become more erratic until they pass out from exhaustion. During this time, SCP-231's effect on the subject's perception of time may shift to match that experienced by an individual under the influence of caffeine or other stimulants.</p><p>If the subject abstains from consuming SCP-231 for an extended period of time (usually several days), their perceptions will return to normal (see Subjective Time Test Log). However, if they are then exposed to another dose or two of SCP-231 while they are re-acclimated they will remain unaffected as before. In addition, continued exposure to a high dosage of SCP-231 will result in these subjects developing longer periods of enhanced consciousness than was possible previously. It has been noted that some subjects addicted to having the effects provided by SCP-231 might never willingly give up their supply even when there is no benefit left for them.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addled/Dazed:</strong> Subjects who consume SCP-231 after being subjected to long periods of sleep or sedation will experience time flows independent of those experienced by other subjects. While under the effects of SCP-231, affected subjects will experience extremely fast time flows that are uncharacteristic of those experienced by normal humans.</p><p><strong>Subjective Time Test Log:</strong></p><p>Addled/Dazed: Subject is administered a dose of SCP-231 while sleeping.</p><p>Omitted, but see below</p><p><strong>Addled/Dazed:</strong> Subject is administered a second dose of SCP-231 while sleeping. (An additional 1/3 of a gram were ingested.)</p><p>Omitted, but see below</p><p><strong>Addled/Dazed:</strong> Subject is administered a third dose of SCP-231 while asleep.</p><p>Omitted, but see below</p><p><strong>Addled/Dazed:</strong> Subject is administered a fourth dose of SCP-231 while asleep.</p><p>Omitted, but see below</p><p><strong>Addled/Dazed:</strong> Subject is administered a fifth dose of SCP-231 while asleep.</p><p>Omitted, but see below']</p>
