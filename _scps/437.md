<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-437</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-437 is to be kept in an airtight container at Site-24. Out of caution, the box should be within a meter of the walls on all sides and at least a meter deep. At no point are any two surfaces to be more than two centimeters apart. The box is not to be opened except in cases requiring extreme measures - basically, whenever we're running low on resources, or when it's time to test out the new fireproofing methods.</p><p>Any personnel who touch SCP-437 are required to wear full-body flame retardant protection and safety goggles at all times. Personnel touching the object are not allowed to eat food, drink liquids, or smoke for three hours following contact. No less than one (1) D-Class personnel should be present at all times near SCP-437 during testing; the D-Class are to be fed only liquid nutrients (sucrose, milk protein isolate, sodium chloride, and glucose) and given a common drug cocktail designed to prevent gout, type II diabetes and renal failure.</p><p>SCP-437 should only be moved under extreme need, such as SCP-439. SCP-437 must never be taken into a bathroom or shower room. The outside of the unit containing SCP-437 is not to be painted unless deemed necessary by Dr. Asahi — paint on any part of SCP-437 carries particularly strong “shielding” properties that could interfere with both testing and containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-437 is a small, clear plastic box approximately six centimeters on each side and three high. If one pushes the top half of the lid off, they can see a small sliver of writing “Gallivanting!” on both sides of the box. The writing disappears if the lid is moved or any part of the box is touched.</p><p>When SCP-437 is taken out of its container, it will not wipe its foot on any surface it encounters as it walks around — even if there are no other humans around. It will attempt to strike only solid objects, including furniture and walls, with its foot - however, in doing so, it will wipe itself on whatever surface he/she has just walked over with tremendous force. For example, when this action occurs against most floors, people may find themselves covered in dust and/or goo that seems to originate from the underside of SCP-437’s leg.</p><p>After SCP-437 has performed this motion three times, it will begin walking through anything within two meters of itself at nightfall — this does not apply to areas where humans have entered or left for the preceding five (5) minutes. The instance walks around for about an hour before disappearing into the shadows or falling over dead from exhaustion. Records indicate that in at least 98% of these instances, the object was found with their head crushed and their eyes missing as if they had been asleep or unconscious during this time period.</p><p>SCP-437's purpose is unknown; attempts to ask it have resulted in little more than its vague replies. D-Class personnel have had varying reactions to its actions in containment; some claim that it is only trying to escape its container while others claim that it doesn't know what "normal" is, and that the concept isn't relevant to it since it cannot understand what goes on outside of its own mind.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Dr. Asahi has decided to subject SCP-437 to a change in containment procedures. Instead of keeping it in an airtight box, he will be attempting to "feed" it. He has requested live test subjects for this purpose, and we have agreed to supply D-Class.</p><p>- Dr. Asahi']</p>
