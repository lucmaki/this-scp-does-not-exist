<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-488</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-487 is to be contained at the Foundation's main site in ████████, and kept under total surveillance of all personnel. Any personnel suspicious of their surroundings are to be administered Class B amnestics, and moved to a safe distance from SCP-487.</p><p>On the off chance that a subject displays anomalous behavior and attempts to approach SCP-487, they are to be sedated by members of the medical staff and detained until they can be returned to their previous location.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-487 is a black stone sculpture of an ape dated to around 100,000 BCE. The sculpture is approximately 16 cm in height, and consists of two parts: a head and torso. SCP-487 will not materialize in any area that lacks a source of AT (any form of energy transfer), including but not limited to space, time, or dimensions. Therefore, periodic scans of the surrounding area are required to locate SCP-487.</p><p>When a subject trespasses into the area around SCP-487 and approaches it, they will slowly begin to lose their distinctive personality characteristics and completely disregard themselves as individuals. This process can take up to five minutes, during which time the subject will experience a severe feeling of inferiority as they attribute all positive traits to SCP-487. Upon reaching this stage, the subject's name will be replaced with “Worth” (no last name), and new names for other characteristics related to their individual identities are created instead. At this point, subjects will make any statements about their failure, their worthiness, or their lack thereof; these statements do not contradict their previous personality traits.</p><p>When the subject nears completion of this process, they will collapse from exhaustion and become inert for several hours before coming out of unconsciousness. After this period of recovery, subjects will find themselves wearing almost identical clothing as the one they were found in when found by Foundation personnel; this clothing also appears to be entirely new. On average subjects do not question how this occurs since they have no memory from before entering SCP-487 (although some have run away after coming out of unconsciousness). Further testing is advised on any subjects who have previously been affected by SCP-487 twice.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> A list of known instances follows; exact copies of SCP-487-1 are not to be used unless necessary.</p><p>Included with each of these is the following message, handwritten in the same handwriting as that found on other SCP-487 documents.</p><p>The first word of each sentence appears in the same color lettering.</p><p>The following are all words from those printed on SCP-487-1</p>
