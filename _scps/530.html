<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-530</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-530 is to be stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber in Site-██. SCP-530 is to be kept sedated and fed IV fluids at all times. Any personnel approaching SCP-530 must wear opaque body armor, as SCP-530 can cause severe damage to unprotected human anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-530 is a human female, approximately 15 years of age. Its body structure is similar to that of a normal human female. However, SCP-530 does not possess any organs or other anatomical components necessary for the maintenance and functioning of such organs. In addition, SCP-530 possesses the ability to temporarily become transparent at will.</p><p>SCP-530's anomalous nature was discovered during ██████ ██ ████, 1993, when a patrol of Foundation agents alerted others to what initially appeared to be an "anomaly". Upon closer examination, it was determined that the cause of the appearance of this anomaly was in fact SCP-530's anomalous properties. Investigation revealed that SCP-530 had been born with its anomalous properties. When SCP-530 was six years old, it killed its mother in an accidental instance of "transparency", and has since been sedated by Foundation agents on a daily basis so as to prevent further damage to public health.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 530-1:</strong> Incident 530-01</p><p>SCP-530's abilities were initially limited to the ability to temporarily become transparent. In early ██, ████, it was found that, if it could be made to believe something, SCP-530 would be able to maintain this state for much longer periods of time. Using this information, Dr. ████ proceeded to alter SCP-530's diet to include hallucinogens and other drugs in order to cause it to become more susceptible to suggestion. On ██/██/███, SCP-530 was rendered unconscious after being administered the LSD derivative ██████ █████. Upon regaining consciousness, SCP-530 immediately became more and more transparent with each passing moment. After a month of this, SCP-530 had become completely transparent, revealing a metal tube located inside its body that extended from its chest cavity to its waist.</p><p>Following this incident, SCP-530 was brought in for testing. During the testing period, SCP-530 continued to display various anomalies, including a constant and severe headache, a severe case of diarrhea, and spontaneous vomiting. Following these tests, SCP-530 was put back into confinement.</p><p>Following these incidents, SCP-530 was again fed LSD derivatives on ██/██/███ in an attempt to make it more susceptible to suggestion. On the following day, SCP-530 began displaying various different effects of the drug, including hallucinations and visual distortions. The following day, SCP-530 began exhibiting symptoms of hallucinogenic poisoning; however, when the dosage was increased, SCP-530 was found to have gained control over its body and stopped experiencing any ill effects.</p><p>After several days of testing, SCP-530 attempted to use its ability to become transparent as a means of escape. When it failed at this task, it quickly became upset and attempted to injure its handlers by striking them with the same force as when it manifested its ability. When restrained and administered Class-A amnestics, SCP-530 was returned to containment for observation.</p>
