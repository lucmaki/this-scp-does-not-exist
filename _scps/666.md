<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-666</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-666 is stored in a small, airtight steel container at Site-2002. It requires no additional protection from outside contaminants.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-666 is a collection of mundane objects that are engraved with an Egyptian-style hieroglyphic text. The text reads “Amun-Ra waits for you at the end of your journey to the underworld.”</p><p>SCP-666 is made up of 22 individual items, of which 10 are broken or missing. Items missing include: a ring, an amulet, a woman’s shoe, a pocketwatch, two pens, an inkwell, an ink-stained piece of paper, an inkhorn, three small bags filled with sand and dirt, two unidentified musical instruments, and 14 smaller items composed of various metals. There are also 13 larger objects composed of wood and other materials (see appendix).</p><p>Some items in SCP-666 contain traces of unknown substances that appear to be naturally occurring minerals. All items except for the ‘smaller objects’ are believed to be made from materials likely found in Egypt. However, as testing on anything less than the large objects is impossible without destroying them completely, it is impossible to test how anomalous each item is individually.</p><p>To date, all attempts to identify the specific people or places referenced in SCP-666 have been unsuccessful. A cursory examination suggests that most if not all the inscriptions refer to events during Amenhotep III’s reign (c. 1390-1352 BCE), but due to the nature of the text it is impossible to accurately date any specific item when referring to one particular event. This has led researchers to suspect that many more inscriptions have been lost over time due to wear and tear.</p><p>The description provided by Addendum 666-B seems most likely: “A rather jovial man with many assistants greets you upon your arrival at an elaborate embalming facility somewhere near the Nile River Delta region in Egypt. He explains that his services will allow you to find peace after death should you choose to proceed with his offer. If you accept him as your guide into oblivion he will lead you through a series of tests and challenges designed to measure your abilities both physical and spiritual; however if he feels that you do not possess the necessary skills required he will refuse further services on grounds of hazardous practices and unethical conduct towards paying customers."</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 666-B:</strong> It is suspected that SCP-666 was created by a mummification guild in the 13th century BCE. However, due to the lack of reliable documentation from this time period, it is impossible to verify any theory.']</p>
