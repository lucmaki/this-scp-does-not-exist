<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-701</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-701 is to be kept in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell. Attending personnel are to monitor SCP-701 for signs of aggression. SCP-701 has been fitted with an electronic monitoring device of the type commonly used for electronic surveillance, to be accessed by Level 2 security personnel should the need arise.</p><p>Any personnel assigned to SCP-701's containment are forbidden from speaking with any person who does not meet the following criteria:</p><p>There is no evidence that SCP-701 is aware of the above or has ever been aware of it. Further testing is pending approval from research division administration.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-701 appears to be a middle aged Caucasian male with a height of 2.3m and weight of 55kg. SCP-701's eyes are described as being of "average size", and feature no discernible coloration. SCP-701 has been observed making facial expressions, but does not possess musculature capable of producing speech. It is theorized that SCP-701 uses its ability for limited manipulation of conventional technology to convey its thoughts when verbal communication is not possible or desired.</p><p>SCP-701 seems to have a degree of intelligence sufficient to learn human interactions, although it exhibited little interest in anything but itself while in Foundation custody. SCP-701 exhibits an awareness of its surroundings and an extraordinary capacity for learning new languages, but displays difficulty understanding written language.</p><p>SCP-701 is able to alter its physical appearance at will, altering its skin tone, eye color, and even body shape via skin grafts (see Incident 701-T). The method by which these alterations are effected is as yet unknown.</p><p>SCP-701 seems only slightly aware that it does not possess the physiological capacity for speech or any other human function, perceiving its lack of these faculties primarily as a nuisance rather than an inability.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Incident 701-T</p><p>On the 9th of March, 2015 an SCP Foundation security team was dispatched to manage a disturbance in a local mall. Upon arrival, they noticed that a customer was attempting to exit the premises. Upon investigation, they found that the subject (SCP-701) had, previously, attempted to leave the premises by changing its form and walking through a hole in the wall.</p><p>The affected section of the mall was quickly secured and SCP-701 was returned to its containment cell.</p><p>When questioned about this incident, SCP-701 claimed to have left the premises after being made aware that he wasn\'t allowed to leave due to his "disability". A follow-up interrogation yielded no further information.</p><p>Forensic examination has determined that SCP-701\'s alterations are not permanent and can be reversed with relative ease.</p>
