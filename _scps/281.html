<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-281</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-281 is to be contained in a standard lockbox, with only two openings. It is to be kept at the Simple Object Containment Lab (SOCL) at Site-19; all tests involving SCP-281 are to be performed in the presence of at least one (1) level 3 personnel.</p><p>Upon request, SCP-281 may be held in custody of an off-site unit associated with the SCP Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-281 is a 19.5Â cm tall sculpture made of papier mache, with a small paintbrush affixed to the left side of its jaw. The brush is painted with different colors; thus far, all colors listed as used in SCP-281's creation have been found.</p><p>Any living organism will feel great comfort while in the presence of SCP-281. It displays an extremely strong attraction to them, and will often display signs of affection by licking or nibbling on their body.</p><p>SCP-281 will attempt to avoid conflict (defined as physical contact between any two organisms) with any other living creature that has not seen it before. SCP-281 will peacefully coexist with another living creature if they are able to see one another. If anything causes SCP-281 to become confused, it will immediately seek out another face that it knows it can trust and show affection towards them; this effect will continue until the confusion is resolved.</p><p>Upon being exposed to any living being that has not seen it before, SCP-281 will rearrange itself such that it 'surveys' the new face(s) and then transition into a comfortably sitting position. Researchers have noted that SCP-281 seems to enjoy seeing this behavior in multiple individuals, but does not seem phased by it at all.</p><p>Addenda:</p><p>Several months after being contained at Site-19, SCP-181 was requested for testing in order to determine whether or not SCPs were capable of learning from each other's behaviors. After displaying the same affectivity towards SCPs as usual, SCP-181 became unresponsive for approximately ten seconds when accompanied by both SCP-281 and SCP-5754. At this time, a number of crows residing outside Site-19 began screaming loudly due to their inability to locate an available source of food or shelter. When the two anomalous objects were separated back into their separate enclosures, security personnel were required to sedate six (6) birds outside the facility with injections of amnestics; note that none of these birds showed any signs of distress or weakness during this ordeal.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 281-1:</strong> On 04/29/2015, SCP-281 was put in a holding cell with a number of other SCPs for the purpose of testing. The following is a log of events that transpired during this event:</p><p>When placed in the cell, SCP-281 became non-responsive, and sat in the fetal position. After approximately twenty minutes, SCP-281's eyes opened, and began to stare directly towards the ceiling. SCP-281 then extended its left arm and began to rub its cheek with it, as if feeling it. SCP-281's eyes then closed, and its body relaxed. At this point, SCP-281 began to hum an unknown tune; this humming continued for approximately fifteen (15) minutes before ceasing.</p><p>When researchers returned to SCP-281's holding cell to remove it, the object suddenly stood up on its own and walked out of the cell, leaving Researchers with no choice but to follow. SCP-281 walked towards the door leading to the hallway, stopping when it reached the door. At this point, SCP-281 appeared to stare at its left forearm for several minutes before extending its arm forward and circling it around; this action lasted for three (3) minutes before ceasing.</p><p>SCP-281 then returned to its initial position and began humming again; this humming lasted for twelve (12) minutes before ceasing. This humming was noted to be very low in pitch and almost inaudible, similar to humming by an infant as opposed to a grown adult.</p><p>SCP-281 again returned to its initial position, sitting down and idly gazing at the ceiling. At this point, it became unresponsive, again returning to its fetal position; however, after approximately five (5) minutes of remaining motionless, SCP-281's eyes suddenly opened and stared directly at a nearby security camera located above the containment cell's entrance. SCP-281's eyes remained open for approximately fifteen (15) seconds before returning back to their previous position.</p><p>All staff members present were instructed not to approach SCP-281 or move any closer than one meter from it at any time during this experiment.</p><p>After numerous tests involving SCP-181, SCP-5754 and other SCPs have determined that all direct contact between SCPs causes no harm or adverse effects on them whatsoever; therefore, all testing involving SCPs is now restricted solely to observation of their interaction with one another.</p>
