<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-929</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-929 is to be kept in a large (20 m x 20 m) testing chamber at Site-██. This chamber has been constructed with an airlock to prevent accidental exposure of the contents. No personnel are to be permitted in this chamber except designated Class-D personnel, who are to wear a SCUBA suit and remain tethered while within the chamber.</p><p>All SCP-929 specimens found outside of the subject's containment area are to be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-929 is a sealed 1.2 m x 2.6 m x 3 m steel tank located in the testing chamber of Site-██, containing a human cadaver, designated SCP-929-9 ("Subject 929") sealed within. Biological samples extracted from the corpse show that it has died of radiation poisoning, with the user of SCP-929 deliberately irradiating it. All similar tanks were destroyed, and all records regarding their construction have been purged.</p><p>The occupant of SCP-929 will move its head to look outside at any point during the day, and remains motionless until nightfall when it resumes moving. No other changes in bodily function or mental state are noted, suggesting the effects are purely psychological. At nightfall, the subject's arms extend towards walls or objects in order to reach them, though they will remain stationary if there is no object within reach.</p><p>When an object is brought within range of SCP-929, the occupant will grasp it and begin to pull itself towards it, even climbing obstacles within its path if necessary. If an obstacle prevents the subject from reaching a particular area, such as a wall or floor, then it will simply cling to the surface and attempt to braid itself into strands until it can reach its destination. After some time spent pulling at objects, SCP-929 will let go and "swim" towards its destination using its arms, which are apparently able to extrude through the surrounding material. The extruded appendages are covered by skin that is translucent and stretchable; it is possible to see through them while they are not soft enough for manipulation or movement.</p><p>SCP-929 has been found capable of opening hundreds of meters-long tunnels on occasion through solid walls and ceilings. It is unknown how long these tunnels last due to their unpredictable nature; however, when outside exploration is possible (when daytime hours occur), tunnels will often be found that run between three or more buildings that are miles apart when opened; this distance may be closer to 20 m or further than 50 m between points depending on terrain and weather conditions. The length of these tunnels does not seem to be dependent on whether or not creatures such as rats are present within them.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is the report of Dr. ███████, who was assigned to SCP-929.</p><p>I\'m not sure what I expected when I first came in here, or what I was hoping to see. I\'ve seen some pretty weird stuff over my years as a researcher, but this… this thing has been downright bizarre since the moment I first saw it. The first time I heard it move was a few minutes after I got here; it was just sitting there at the top of the stairs, staring at me with its blank eyes. I wasn\'t even sure if it was alive or not at that point. It didn\'t move again until nightfall, when it began climbing up the stairs towards me. That\'s when I realized that it had no way of doing so without moving; by the time it reached me, it had completely submerged itself within the wall. It seemed to have been looking for me specifically from then on, and would occasionally reach out for me all day long.</p><p>I know, I know. I should have noticed sooner that this thing wasn\'t acting like any other specimen, but… but there\'s something about it. Something very different about it. It\'s almost like it\'s trying to… to communicate with me somehow, but I haven\'t been able to figure out what it\'s trying to tell me. The first few times I tried to talk to it, it would just stare blankly back at me as if trying to say something, but every time I tried again it would do the same thing. I\'ve tried everything else I can think of except for speaking to it directly; when I did try that, it just stared back at me with those empty black eyes and didn\'t seem able to say anything.</p><p>I\'ve really given this thing everything I could think of by now, but nothing has worked yet. This thing just… doesn\'t make sense. There\'s nothing in here that would cause any kind of reaction from another person. Even if we\'re talking about an entirely different kind of human being trapped in here, you\'d think that they\'d react differently to their surroundings than this "subject" does.</p><p>When night falls and the subject pulls itself towards whatever object the guards leave for them outside of containment, we take turns opening the door and watching them go into those tunnels. None of us are allowed in there, though; we don\'t want whatever is down there to get out and hurt anyone else on our watch. When we open the door and see those appendages just waving in front of us, all you can hear is a collective sigh from everyone who\'s ever held this job before you and watched one of these things go inside for the night; you can tell everyone in here is thinking the same thing too, because no one says anything until the next morning when we open the door again and find out what happened.</p><p>It really is just frustrating how little we know about these things. We don\'t even know what they\'re called or how they\'re able to do whatever they do when they get inside an object or through a wall or ceiling. Everything we know right now comes from one particular test we did when we first captured one of these things outside of containment; that test showed us how they were able to get through solid walls and ceilings by reaching out with their arms and grabbing onto things, and also showed us how they could pull themselves into place without any kind of force at all except for their own muscles and tendons pulling them towards their destination. We\'ve been waiting for another opportunity like that one since then, but… well, this is what we get for waiting around for something we know will never happen again.']</p>
