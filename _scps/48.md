<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-48</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-48 is contained in a standard Safe object containment unit located at Site-88. Current equipment requirements for SCP-48 include life support and an acoustic dampening system. SCP-48's room has been modified to provide a flat, smooth floor. Following its original acquisition, personnel are instructed to avoid the area of most recent damage caused by SCP-48. Personnel with sensitive hearing should refrain from entering SCP-48's containment chamber at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-48 is a black, humanoid entity measuring 1.5 m (5 ft) in height. While not appearing to be animate, SCP-48 shows a hostile reaction whenever it is observed. SCP-48 is largely fluid and fusiform in its appearance, but exhibits appendages at the ends of arms and legs that appear to be made of an indestructible material and are described as "marbles." These appendages, as well as SCP-48's torso and head, appear to be composed entirely of glass. SCP-48 is completely immobile despite being able to detect motion around it.</p><p>Observation of SCP-48's appendages has shown them to attach themselves to objects that are struck with enough force. Once attached, SCP-48 will then use its appendages to manipulate whatever object it was attached to for up to 3 minutes before detaching. The manipulation can be performed in several different ways, including the following:</p><p>SCP-48's anomalous properties manifest whenever an individual strikes itself with force typically greater than 35 kg (75 lb). Subjects who suffer severe injuries are usually observed with one or more appendages detached from their bodies, often resulting in amputation. Despite this damage, subjects report no pain following movement. Subjects claim that the detachment is completely painless and instantaneous, often lasting mere seconds following contact with themselves.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 48-01:</strong> On the morning of ██/██/20██, SCP-48 was accidentally damaged by a high-speed collision with a vehicle that fell into a regime pit contained within its containment unit. The collision broke SCP-48's containment unit and resulted in severe damage to SCP-48 itself. While SCP-48 did not suffer any further damage from this event, it is currently believed that SCP-48 will not recover from this incident."]</p>
