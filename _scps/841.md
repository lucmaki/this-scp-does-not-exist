<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-841</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-841 is to be kept in an outside containment chamber at Site ██, guarded by two security guards at all times. Facility entrances are to be monitored and only allowed personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.</p><p>Requests for testing of SCP-841 must be approved by at least two (2) members of the onsite research team. Testing may only take place when the atmospheric pressure is stable between 994 and 1019 torr (1 mbar). Research staff are to remain within ten feet of SCP-841 while testing is in progress.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-841 is a pair of glasses resembling ██████ brand sunglasses. SCP-841's design is similar to those produced by ██████ Brand Optical, but the logo and color scheme are different. The lenses are one millimeter thick and reflect light as if they were made of glass. When SCP-841 is not in use, the lenses will camouflage themselves using a highly advanced camouflage technology. This camouflage is visible only with infrared sensors. SCP-841 also functions as an infra-red filter.</p><p>SCP-841 appears to have begun functioning automatically when placed on the individual wearing it, regardless of whether they were aware of its presence at the time. If the wearer's eye condition prevents them from keeping the object on their person, it will "possess" them and move with them throughout the day until they find another place to put it down for the night. If a wearer removes SCP-841 for long periods of time or becomes conscious of its presence when it is not present, it will manifest itself within approximately one (1) minute to take over their body and send them back to work or school until their next break.</p><p>SCP-841 will possess any individual who does not have corrective lenses in their eyes when it first comes into contact with them. The process is involuntary and will continue even if the headgear is removed or replaced after first contact is made. Throughout the course of testing SCP-841 has continued to appear in several other individuals without provocation or awareness on their part.</p><p>SCP-841 has shown no capacity for mimicry or replication; however, altering genetic material has been observed when removing SCP-841 from test subjects. No genetic alterations have occurred without express permission from research staff and all alterations have been reversible once removed by the initial test subject. This DNA alteration may be induced by the accretion of subatomic particles within the ocular complex of SCP-841 while possessor(s) are sleeping with their eyes closed. Sleep studies have revealed that subjects wear SCP-841 while asleep between 80 and 95% of nights spent awake each week; this suggests that sleep deprivation may be an effective way to reduce visibility characteristics in test subjects, but so far sleep deprivation has not resulted in spontaneous item removal or loss of sight due to accumulation of nanometer sized particulate matter within the artificial environment created by SCP-841's filtering system.</p><p>Each possessed subject experiences temporary physical changes directly related to a change in vision experienced by real humans whenever eyeglasses are worn up until about forty years old. After this age point, visual capabilities return to normal levels for all tested individuals (but not for possessed subjects). Tests indicate that pupil dilation begins within thirty seconds after item removal, which can shorten darkness perception by eight minutes per twenty percent increase in diameter (assuming 20 mm pupils). Pupil dilations will occur despite any attempt to prevent eye contact with existing light sources during testing sessions using artificial lighting devices or concealable lighting solutions such as colored sunglasses unless artificial light sources are universally avoided during testing periods.</p><p>Testing results suggest that SCP-841 can initiate transitions between multiple sets of visual capabilities at a given time within an individual under controlled circumstances; however, further research into these capabilities has not yet been performed due to security concerns involved with showing examples of alternate forms of SCP objects beyond humanoid phase patterns and creatures containing objects of anomalous nature due to possible exploitation by hostile parties potentially interested in acquiring such entities for use in espionage operations or specialized projects involving genetic engineering.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 841.1:</strong> The following is a list of all individuals known to have had SCP-841 worn in their eyes up until forty years of age.</p><p>Subject No. ██</p><p>Subject No. ██ was fifty years old at the time of testing and, as expected, experienced no change in vision when wearing SCP-841. After approximately five minutes of wearing SCP-841, Subject No. ██ began to experience motion sickness and nausea for the first time in his life. After two hours he was sent back to his sick bed. He awakened several minutes later with a severe headache, blurred vision, and an inability to see even the most basic of details, such as color or contrast. This visual impairment persisted for the next fifteen years until he died of a heart attack at the age of sixty-two.']</p>
