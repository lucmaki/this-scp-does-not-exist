<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-429</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Ten to fifteen open or closed bait boxes are to be made available around the premises of SCP-429. Installed within these boxes is a healthy population of ground squirrels (Spermophilus), which may be counted and removed when necessary. When an instance of SCP-429 appears, it is to be detained using tranquilizing darts and contained in a cage with a solar-powered air filter. Any surviving instances of SCP-429 are to be relocated elsewhere for experimental purposes.</p><p>After a week, consumption rates will begin to increase significantly and the air inside of the containment area will become heavily polluted. Human personnel entering the area at this time should wear highly permeable respiratory masks, and experience no adverse effects from SCP-429's inhalation properties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-429 is a large black bear that is extremely prolific, reproducing at an extremely high rate. SCP-429 has not been observed to die of natural causes, though it has been known to be shot and killed on several occasions. When not under observation, SCP-429 spends its time feeding on livestock and humans, with the former being its primary food source. It will also consume non-human animals if they are unable to move quickly enough, such as seals or whales.</p><p>When provoked in any way (including but not limited to being shot, attacked, or injured), SCP-429 will settle down at the site of the disturbance with its ears laid back and breathing heavily. Its behavior appears to be based on a sentience scale similar to that of humans; in particular, it shows extreme anger when provoked beyond acceptable levels. However, if directly confronted by a human who does not possess adequate protective gear (or is simply unwilling to wear one), it will often be seen baring its teeth and growling at the individual in question.</p><p>At this time, SCP-429 will begin sucking on its open wounds (as well as those given to it by other objects). Once full, SCP-429 will take a few steps away from the area and then lie down, appearing unconscious for approximately five minutes. At this point, it will begin to rapidly produce saliva out of its mouth and into the wounds in which it originally bit itself. The wound will become completely healed within five minutes of this process beginning; however, this process is perceived as excruciatingly painful by all animals that are exposed to it except humans, who instead find themselves filled with a deep desire to alleviate said pain. This effect only lasts as long as SCP-429's life force allows before it dies; typically around thirty minutes after exposure.</p><p>If left alone at these points, SCP-429 will once again begin licking the wounds in which it bit itself. When no more wounds remain available for consumption, SCP-429 will lie down again for several minutes before finally dying from exhaustion.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-429 was first discovered on April 12, 1997, in the town of ████, California. The specific phenomenon that occurs during SCP-429\'s "feeding" periods was initially unknown, but it was eventually discovered that the cause of SCP-429\'s death was a terminal case of tuberculosis in its throat. In addition to this, SCP-429 was known to have been shot on several occasions by hunters while it was still a cub; these wounds were never found until after its discovery at a local wildlife refuge.</p><p>At the time of discovery, SCP-429 was being kept at the ████ Wildlife Protection Center. After it had been deemed too dangerous to continue keeping, it was ultimately relocated to a nearby reserve. During its time at the reserve, however, several personnel began to develop severe symptoms relating to the inhalation of SCP-429\'s saliva, and it was ultimately transferred to Site-05.</p>
