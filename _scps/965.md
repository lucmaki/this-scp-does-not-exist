<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-965</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-965 is contained within a series of underwater caverns which have been outfitted with state-of-the-art acoustic deterrent technology. SCP-965 is not to be approached by personnel unless absolutely necessary; any personnel who does so will be terminated on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-965 is a species of eagle, approximately 5m long, with an average wingspan of 9.4m. Its plumage is primarily white and black with subtle red markings; it possesses sharp talons, and its beak is equipped with a pair of large, serrated "fangs". SCP-965 was first observed in ████████, ██████ sometime in the early 19██; since that time, it has been sighted on numerous occasions in various locations around the world.</p><p>SCP-965 appears to be able to see any human being who enters the vicinity of its nest, regardless of the level of light or darkness in which that person is found. This effect occurs whether or not the individual is aware of SCP-965. Furthermore, SCP-965 often attacks trespassers before they have had sufficient time to perceive its presence.</p><p>SCP-965 seems completely incapable of flight; however, it can move almost instantaneously from one place to another at speeds which have not been measured. SCP-965 has been known to attack personnel with its talons while they are still in midair, causing them to plummet hundreds of meters into the depths below.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong></p><p>Dr. █████: I think we\'ve made contact with the bird.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> What do we have, Charlie?</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> Two separate audio signals have been detected within the nest.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> How loud are they?</p><p><strong>Dr. █████:</strong> Not very; the first is a dull series of clicks, and the second seems to be some sort of "whispering" sound.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████:</strong> Send them over to me! Maybe there\'s some kind of communication going on.</p><p>Dr. ████ takes out a pair of headphones and begins listening to SCP-965\'s audio message, which is instantly translated by his laptop computer into English on his display screen. The message is brief, but its content alters regularly…</p><p>>enter code word']</p>
