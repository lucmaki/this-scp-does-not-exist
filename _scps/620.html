<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-620</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-620 is to be kept in a custom security locker, made of reinforced titanium and reinforced concrete. Entrance to the locker requires a high-level security clearance, requiring either a Level-5 security clearance or the presence of at least one (1) Level-3 personnel. SCP-620 is to be kept under a guard of no fewer than four (4) level 3 personnel at all times, who must be armed with either silenced weapons or gas masks.</p><p>Any subject attempting to enter the containment chamber of SCP-620 must first undergo a psychological evaluation by a trained psychologist and/or psychiatrist familiar with SCP-620 before being allowed entry. Any object moved by an individual moving within SCP-620 must be thoroughly examined for concealed weaponry before being allowed to enter containment.</p><p>Personnel assigned to the containment chamber must be solely responsible for keeping the interior of the chamber secure at all times; in addition to the four guards stationed within the chamber, two (2) Level-3 personnel are to remain within the chamber at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-620 appears to be a vase from classical antiquity, of the type normally used for flower arrangement. SCP-620 possesses no anomalous properties until one begins to move within it. At this point, SCP-620 behaves in a manner comparable to that of an active memetic agent; instances of SCP-620 are incapable of lying or speaking untruthfully, and will always express their emotions in a way consistent with their nature.</p><p>Subjects moving within SCP-620 will experience mood changes and behavioral changes based on their current behavior towards it; those who show hostility towards SCP-620 (e.g. by refusing to enter it), or exhibit aggressive behavior towards it (such as forcibly trying to move it) are more likely to feel aggression in return, while those more willing to enter SCP-620 will experience less violent emotions and changes in behavior. If individuals are found to not conform to these conditions they must be subjected to quarantine until the effects of SCP-620 can be determined after a period of isolation lasting at least five days.</p><p>SCP-620 was recovered in ██/██/████, when Foundation agents raided a residence containing several individuals connected with the [REDACTED] cult. Agents also discovered records indicating that an individual bearing the name "Admiral" had been present for all meetings held between members of this cult and other notable figures of history throughout time, including Napoleon Bonaparte, Georges Washington and ██████████ ██████ ██████ ██████ ██████ ██████. This individual, according to interrogations conducted during initial containment, is believed to be responsible for engaging known memetic agents such as SCP-001, SCP-034 and SCP-614 in physical combat with no appropriate countermeasures being available (see Interview Log 620-A). Inquiries relating to this individual have thus far received no response from Dr ███████████, the individual responsible for experimenting with these incredibly deadly objects due to his position as High Priest of the [REDACTED] cult.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 620-1:</strong> On ██/██/████, Dr ███████████ was executed by agents of the Foundation for his involvement in the [REDACTED] cult. An autopsy revealed that a large portion of his brain had been removed, and no attempt had been made to replace it with a replacement. The cause of this is unknown at this time.']</p>
