<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-948</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid-K</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-948 is kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. Any potential sources of SCP-948 are to be quarantined and immediately incinerated.</p><p>SCP-948 is kept in a secure, immovable container within its containment chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-948 is a black, metal switch with a round cap. SCP-948 appears to be based on Japanese era switches used in factories to produce various products.</p><p>SCP-948's anomalous nature activates when an object is held within the reach of SCP-948 for approximately 60 seconds. Upon activation, SCP-948 simultaneously and instantaneously strikes any objects that are nearby, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>SCP-948 deactivates when an object is removed from its range. If the object is not handled by anyone other than SCP-948 itself, it will return to its ordinary state once left unattended.</p><p>SCP-948 was recovered during a raid on a factory located ██████, Japan. SCP-948 was found when agents entered the warehouse where SCP-948 was stored and noticed what appeared to be a switch being pressed against [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-948 was discovered in a factory located ██████, Japan. A raid was conducted on the warehouse housing SCP-948, which was found to be owned by ████████ ████ Limited (███████).</p><p>During the raid, SCP-948's anomalous properties were triggered before it could be recovered. Apologies for the excessive amount of expunging. Suppressing further information regarding SCP-948's properties is currently deemed to be too dangerous"]</p>
