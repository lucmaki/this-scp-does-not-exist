<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-125</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-125 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site 17. Its casing is to be checked regularly for any signs of damage and repaired if necessary.</p><p>SCP-125 is to be disconnected from its power source during testing, and checked for the presence of non-anomalous components before reconnection.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-125 is a coffee machine with two legs, capable of standing on its own. It is about the size of a small kettle and has a height of 102 cm. SCP-125 is made out of plastic, around the same colour as normal black coffee, though it always appears to be an off-white colour.</p><p>SCP-125 has no anomalous properties until its coffee is made. Once SCP-125's coffee has been brewed, however, it takes a humanoid shape. This humanoid can materialize entirely from SCP-125's coffee or from spilled coffee on the ground.</p><p>Upon its transition into this form, the coffee becomes transparent and translucent and can easily be seen through by onlookers. The coffee urn/coffee pot turns off for unknown reasons, switching back to normal function after about three hours of brewing. Currently, there does not seem to be a limit to how much SCP-125's coffee will make in one sitting; it is known to make between 60 kg and 1000 kg of coffee in one sitting.</p><p>Due to this phenomenon, the testing logs below have been redacted. Any information indicated with ██ is classified information or research data that cannot be reproduced or leaked without grave consequences.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 125-1:</strong> SCP-125 was discovered on the 27th of February, ████, in a small town in ██████, Mexico. It had been left against a wall outside of a small cafe. The owner of the cafe had fallen asleep behind the counter after a long day of brewing coffee and had not noticed SCP-125's anomalous properties.</p>
