<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-18</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-18 is currently kept in a standard containment locker at Site-17. Should SCP-18's scroll be removed from SCP-18's base, SCP-18 must be completely submerged in water. If removal of the scroll causes any damage to it, the newly-spooled portion of the scroll must be sutured or otherwise fixed before repositioning the SCiP.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-18 is a scroll containing the teachings of ██████ █████, a Mesopotamian sage dating to around 400 BCE. SCP-18 may be unrolled, as long as all portions of the scroll are kept properly in place. The scroll is connected to a mechanism that allows repositioning of the scroll's parts.</p><p>SCP-18's teachings may be read from beginning to end, but the scroll is not self-contained in any way. The teachings must be read back through the entirety of its 3,600+ years of existence before it can be said to have an internal order.</p><p>Most of these teachings revolve around morality, philosophy, and life skills; however, it is impossible to discern any pattern throughout the scroll or to find anything within it that contradicts itself. Most likely, this was done intentionally.</p><p>In terms of its content, SCP-18 has proven more useful than initially thought. It has been used to determine origins of religious texts and beliefs as well as learning important knowledge about survival and common sense. Unfortunately for its creators, this knowledge is often forgotten by time. Recipients have found that when their scrolls have been read through in full, they become much wiser and happier individuals. Subjects have also been found to remember vast amounts less than when the scroll was only partially read.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 18-1:</strong> SCP-18 is currently being used to test a hypothesis by Dr. X.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> A single page of SCP-18 is exposed to a subject. Subject is told that they are keeping the scroll safe in their pack, and that they will be able to return it to the scroll's original position when they are ready.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subjects have been found to have forgotten the scroll after time. Subjects have also been found to remember less from the scroll than when it was only partially read.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subjects are allowed to read through the scroll in its entirety. Subjects are given a pen and paper for notes.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subjects remembered more information from the scroll than when it was only partially read."]</p>
