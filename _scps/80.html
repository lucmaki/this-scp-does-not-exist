<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-80</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-80 is stored in a secure container at Site 23. During testing, SCP-80 is to be kept above 40 degrees Celsius; any temperature lower than this will trigger visible symptoms of SCP-80.</p><p>Should SCP-80 start glowing, one member of security staff is to move the object to within 5 m of the nearest air conditioning unit. MTF Beta-5 ("Rasputins") is stationed at Site 23 to deter unauthorized examinations of SCP-80.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-80 is a ceramic doll, approximately 8 cm tall. The doll has a hard and durable exterior, with a smooth and shiny surface. The doll's hair appears to be made of a textile material, the texture of which resembles human hair.</p><p>SCP-80 is susceptible to extremes of temperature; when exposed to temperatures below 5 °C or above 40 °C, the doll gives off an odor which strongly resembles that of rotting meat. This smell results in rapid acceleration of decomposition in all SCP-80-contaminated objects as soon as temperatures rise above 20 °C. Objects that have been contaminated by SCP-80 will continue to decay until they are fully consumed by SCP-80. Only human skin remains unaffected from these effects, due to its elasticity.</p><p>If a human being is placed in direct contact with SCP-80, the subject will experience disorientation and confusion for approximately ten minutes before dying at an approximate rate of 4% body fat per minute.</p><p>SCP-80 was recovered from the home of D.D., after she had suffocated her husband Eric with her own arms during an argument over SCP-80. SCP-80 came into Foundation possession following this event, on the basis of its anomalous properties.</p><p>Interviewed: D.D., former front door supervisor</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ██████</p><p>Foreword: Interview took place during Foundation interaction with SCP-80, which was now appearing in the home of D.D. Rather than attempting to test escape procedures for the object, Dr. ██████ decided to simply interview D.D., recording all responses while they were occurring.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum-1:</strong> Following testing, SCP-80 was relocated to Site 23. D.D. was terminated for unauthorized use of Foundation resources and for concealing anomalous objects.</p>
