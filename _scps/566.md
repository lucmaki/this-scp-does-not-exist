<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-566</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-566 is to be contained in a heavily guarded facility. Any civilians who approach the site are to be immediately detained and questioned.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-566 is an anomalous cloud present over a small town in ██████, California. As of 11/17/20██, SCP-566 is approximately fifteen meters high and has reached the level of a Category 3 Storm Cloud.</p><p>While SCP-566 has not yet caused any severe damage, it has been observed to cause mild discomfort to nearby populations.</p><p>SCP-566 was discovered on 11/16/20██ when a storm cell passed over the town of ██████, CA. While there were no reports of rain, droplets began falling from SCP-566. The rain intensified and a tornado formed over the town.</p><p>The tornado destroyed ██████'s local hospital and several other buildings before moving into the surrounding hills. Evidence showed that the ground had been moving underneath the structure for the duration of the event. The storm system dissipated four hours later and SCP-566 became partially visible in clear weather.</p><p>SCP-566 appeared transparent and faint save for an unidentified image visible within it at 40 meters away from the object. Both SCP-566 and this image appear blurry upon closer inspection with few details being distinguishable from either entity's surface texture.</p><p>The same image appears in a smaller scale on foggy days within 10 kilometers of SCP-566. It also appears near sunset or dawn to observers living at distances between 5 and 15 kilometers from SCP-566's location.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 566-1:</strong> On 11/17/20██, at approximately ██:██, SCP-566 was observed to change its shape and become more solid-looking. The image within SCP-566 also changed from a blurry, translucent appearance to a clearer, more detailed depiction of a human male in his late twenties.</p><p>SCP-566 abruptly began to rise into the air and kept this action until it reached an estimated height of ██ meters. It stopped rising shortly after the image on its surface began to alter. The picture blurred again and turned into an image of what appears to be a human male. The figure appeared to be wearing a pair of denim jeans, a black button up shirt, and a pair of glasses.</p><p>The figure then began walking towards the woods, and disappeared shortly after leaving sight.</p><p>As of 11/19/20██, SCP-566 is currently approaching the level of a Category 4 Storm Cloud.']</p>
