<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-179</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All Foundation assets in the U.S. state of Ohio have been mobilized for the protection of SCP-179, and are to report the arrival of fire vehicles and emergency services personnel to the Area-51 Command Post for coordination.</p><p>Prior to containment of SCP-179, measures are taken to prevent civilians from approaching SCP-179, as well as to keep unauthorized persons from approaching or entering Area-51. Any civilian or site personnel found on SCP-179 is to be detained and administered Class B amnestics by a remote agent, with the exception of those who manage to successfully extinguish any fires at SCP-179. Personnel in charge of this task are instructed to use lethal force if necessary.</p><p>When not being controlled, the following protocols should be used in conjunction with containment procedures:</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-179 is an artificial fire lookout tower, located on Mount Mitchell in North Carolina. The main point of interest is the entrance to SCP-179, which is a large, dark cavern filled with black smoke that never dissipates.</p><p>If the inside of SCP-179 is illuminated by any light source, the gas inside it will begin to form into humanoid forms resembling humans. These creatures are described as being medium-sized, muscular, wearing ragged clothing and armed with improvised weapons. The creatures also have red "eyes" in the middle of their chests.</p><p>SCP-179's anomalous properties are activated when a fire or any other light source is pointed at it. Once this happens, a number of creatures will appear to be trying to escape from within the smoke. The number and identity of these creatures depends on the nature of the "fire".</p><p>Specimen I: The first specimen of SCP-179 was a small forest fire, which produced several ordinary looking human adults (currently located in Site-689's holding cell) along with several light brown objects made up of soft material.</p><p>Specimen II: A large warehouse fire, which produced six "firefighters" (currently located in Site-25's holding cell). Although they were wearing safety gear similar to what we would use nowadays, they were heavily injured and had burns covering most of their bodies. One notably resembled someone called "Joey".</p><p>Specimen III: An outdoor fire that occurred in an abandoned house near the base of SCP-179 produced two affected civilians named Jake and Hailey who were described as teenagers. They were both severely burned but seemed to be conscious. They complained of intense pain but remembered nothing else due to severe trauma. Containment protocol has been modified and no more human casualties are expected from fires at SCP-179.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 179-A:</strong> On ██/██/1950, a large fire in an abandoned warehouse near the base of SCP-179 resulted in the death of three of its human victims. These victims were then found to be alive and in possession of far more documentation than expected. The documentation included several pages of documents regarding the creation of SCP-179 and several letters written by former Foundation agent Albert Rutherford.</p><p>Agent Rutherford had been assigned to the containment of SCP-179 under the codename "Virgil" before he was killed during a mission in ██████████, Georgia. The Foundation was unaware at that time that Agent Rutherford had been in communication with a known black marketeer, who was attempting to sell information on the artifact to various companies and individuals.</p><p>All recovered documentation has been filed under Site-25\'s archives section and is currently being translated by linguists fluent in English, German, and Russian</p>
