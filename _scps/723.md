<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-723</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Containment Specialist Item</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-723 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, covered with a clear film.</p><p>4 hours before its scheduled use, the film covering SCP-723 must be removed and SCP-723 must be administered orally via a disposable syringe. SCP-723 is not to be used above 500 mgs of sodium per day. This dosage is deemed acceptable due to the fact that induced sodium deficiencies can be cured by the administration of electrolytes.</p><p>SCP-723 is to be safe guarded at all times. Access to SCP-723 outside of the testing chamber is not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-723 is an in-vitro pharmaceutical brand called "Viagran". This product, created by a company named "Ordinance Pharmaceuticals", was derived from a mixture of human blood and antibiotics. Because it is a combination of two substances that can be found in nature, neither SCP-723 nor the manufacturer are considered anomalous.</p><p>SCP-723 is able to alter its properties if its dosage is altered; When administered under normal circumstances, SCP-723 has the speed of a drug which would take 25 seconds to reach maximum effect. When prescribed at a dosage of 500 mg to 1 gram per day (3.5 g to 14 g), it will take 9 days for the first dose to reach full effect. At this point, the user must take another dose in order for the drug's effects to be maintained. In high dosages, this time requirement reduces to 2 hours.</p><p>In addition to being able to maintain its properties indefinitely, SCP-723 can influence its user's body chemistry in such a way as to almost completely eliminate all allergic reactions which would normally occur when administering drugs for long periods of time. The only side effects are those noted below:</p><p>Addiction: A person who takes more than 200 mgs per day will undergo withdrawals when it is stopped or administered less than 250 mgs per day. Usually, this addiction can be resolved by increasing the dosage until it reaches 400 mgs per day (over 5 grams).</p><p>Kidney damage: Users increase their risk of developing kidney diseases by using SCP-723 repeatedly over long periods of time. This risk increases with increased dosages and/or more frequent administrations.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-723 was first discovered in a small town in █████████, ██████. The town's mayor, ████████ ████████, had been using SCP-723 for at least 2 years on himself and his family.</p><p>After this discovery, the Foundation was contacted. After searching the town and interrogating ████████ ████████, it was determined that he had been selling the drug to other civilians. After being informed of the Foundation's interest in SCP-723, ████████ ████████ attempted to kill himself. He was successfully contained and interrogated by undercover agents and confirmed as the sole source of SCP-723."]</p>
