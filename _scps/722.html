<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-722</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-722 is to be kept in an airtight containment chamber at Site ██. Any personnel entering the containment chamber are to wear SCBA suits and are not allowed to remove their facemasks until they leave the chamber. The chamber itself is to be kept at a constant 50 degrees Celsius to prevent SCP-722 from forming.</p><p>SCP-722 is kept in a liquid nitrogen tank and is provided with a daily ration of fresh human blood. Subjects that have been exposed to SCP-722 are to be amnestized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-722 is a non-anomalous 7.62 mm caliber bullet located in ██████, Ireland.</p><p>SCP-722 is capable of passing through any solid matter without hindrance, including metals, wood, and human tissue.</p><p>Upon entering flesh, a portion of the bullet will remain embedded within the subject’s body. This portion will grow along with the subject at a rate equal to the average height of an adolescent human male between the ages of 13 and 18. This growth is not harmful to the subject’s health and causes no pain or discomfort.</p><p>The growth rate depends primarily on age and access to blood. The growth can be slowed by causing severe trauma to the subject’s body or by completely stopping the subject’s blood supply.</p><p>SCP-722 was found in an abandoned house in ██████, Ireland on ██/██/19██ after it was reported that a man living in the house had suddenly disappeared while playing with his pet rat. The bullet was discovered inside a safe in a bedroom closet that had been broken into during a burglary perpetrated by two teenage boys.</p>
