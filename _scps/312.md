<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-312</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-312 is to be contained in a 9m x 3m x 3m storage chamber located at Area-12, accessible by use of an SCP-312-1 keycard. SCP-312 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber with a temperature that is conducive to keeping it at its ambient temperature of 15°C ± 2°C. Any personnel are to be kept at a distance of 5m from the door leading into the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-312 is a computer running Windows XP, originally installed by IT personnel of [REDACTED] Ltd. It is believed that SCP-312 was brought in through an employee's laptop which had been infected with the WannaCry ransomware virus.</p><p>When a subject approaches within 3 meters of SCP-312, approximately 10 white lines begin to appear in front of it around its visual field. The first of these lines will appear on line 3,843 of the screen. These lines increase in length until they reach line 904,625. If a subject looks directly at the screen when this occurs, they will be rendered temporarily unable to move or consciously process information.</p><p>Subjects will recover after three minutes of looking at the screen. The longer a subject looks at the screen, the more lines will be produced and the longer it will take for them to recover from viewing it.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Incident 312-1</p><p>On ██/██/20██, a laptop was brought in to the Containment Chamber containing SCP-312. When the subject was asked to look at SCP-312, it was found that it had been infected with a variant of the Cryptolocker ransomware virus. The subject had not been able to access any files on the laptop, but after approximately one hour of exposure to SCP-312 it began to process information again. IT personnel were then sent to remove all traces of the infection from the system.</p><p>After approximately five hours of exposure to SCP-312, the subject was able to recover files from the laptop and attempt to log back into their work account. A user on the account attempted to send a message to an employee at [REDACTED] Ltd.</p><p><strong>The message read:</strong></p><p>Subject: =?iso-8859-1?Q?GwC=?=</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> =?iso-8859-1?Q?GwC=?=</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> =?iso-8859-1?Q?GwC=?=</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> =?iso-8859-1?Q?GwC=?=</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> =?iso-8859-1?Q?GwC=?=</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> =?iso-8859-1?Q?GwC=?=</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> =?iso-8859-1?Q?GwC=?=</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> =?iso-8859-1?Q?GwC=?=']</p>
