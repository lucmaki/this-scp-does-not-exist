<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-989</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-989 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. SCP-989 is to be fed standard humanoid rations at specified intervals, and provided with recreation time as per standard practice for humanoid containment. SCP-989 is not to be allowed outside of the cell without permission from at least two Level 3 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-989 is an apparently human male of indeterminate age, standing at 1.6 meters in height and weighing 72 kilograms. It appears to be an ageless entity, however it will have signs of aging later in its life. SCP-989's skin tone is light brown and its hair is a dark brown color.</p><p>SCP-989 has several unusual abilities. It can manipulate both fire and water with great skill, being capable of producing and manipulating fire with a minimum of effort, as well as water to a lesser extent. It also has a unique ability to see through any material it is touching, allowing it to see through any object from which it is touching. This makes it difficult to hide items from SCP-989 because it can reach them through the cell bars without difficulty.</p><p>SCP-989 was discovered when an incident involving a fire occurred in downtown ████████████, Wyoming in 20██. The town was full of cowboys dressed in western attire, at least ██ of which were found to be instances of SCP-989. It was originally thought that this event were part of some kind of publicity stunt by [DATA EXPUNGED], but no such stunt has been documented or verified. When interviewed by Foundation agents, SCP-989 appeared to have no knowledge of its anomalous ability, claiming that he was born on ██/██/20██ in ████████, Wyoming to [REDACTED]. Further investigation revealed that SCP-989 had been wandering around the town at the time due to marital problems it had experienced with its wife. After the incident was contained, SCP-989's DNA was taken for future testing purposes.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-989 and SCP-****** were found together in a cell in ████████, Wyoming on ██/██/20██. SCP-****** attempted to escape and was subdued by Site-██ personnel. SCP-989 states that it recruited SCP-****** as an unwitting accomplice who had an interest in the occult. It states that they acted on its request to perform a ritual of unknown nature, which was aborted when said accomplice was captured by Foundation agents.</p><p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-989 was found to be experimenting with an unknown entity that had been imprisoned in a holding cell located near where it and SCP-****** had been housed. DNA testing confirmed that this entity was an instance of SCP-1199, the Elder Lich. SCP-989 stated that he had used SCP-****** to assist with his research, after which it attempted to recruit SCP-****** as an unwitting accomplice to perform some sort of ritual upon its release from containment.</p><p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-989 was found to be experimenting with an entity that had been imprisoned in a holding cell located near where it and SCP-****** had been housed. A fire broke out in this cell, which resulted in the release of SCP-1199. Agents present at the scene were able to prevent SCP-1199 from escaping the facility, but were unable to locate it again following the incident. Agents proceeded to interview SCP-989 about the event.</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-989</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ██████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Transcripts of interviews with SCP-989 are transcribed from memory, as it is impossible to document a video recording without disrupting its functionality. They also contain information that has not been properly documented or proven.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Hello, 989, can you hear me? 989? Can you hear me? 989?</p><p><strong>SCP-989:</strong> Yeah, I heard ya loud and clear! What can I do for ya?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Before we begin, I would like to ask you a few questions. Where are you currently located?</p><p><strong>SCP-989:</strong> [REDACTED], Wyoming, hang on now! I ain\'t gonna say nothin\' until I know what\'s this all about! Maybe you can tell me what this is all about first!</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> I assure you that we are only interested in your well-being and that of your companion; if there\'s anything we can do for you, please let us know.</p><p><strong>SCP-989:</strong> You got some nerve, talking about how concerned yer are about my happiness or whatever yer sayin\', ya wanna talk about somebody else\'s happiness! Jus\' leave \'em alone! They got nothin\' ta do with this! None of them did nothin\' but cause trouble! Now why don\'tcha tell me what this is all abou\'. Maybe then I might start talkin\'…</p><p>[At this point, SCP-989 was cut off by cries of "No!"]</p><p><strong>SCP-989:</strong> Sorry guys, but I gotta go now… You guys stay outta trouble okay? You hear me!? Stay outta trouble! If ya mess up again then we\'re gonna have to separate yer from guys who didn\'t ask for it anyway… (laughs) Weirdos… Well bye now… \'Bye ']</p>
