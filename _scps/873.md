<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-873</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-873 instances are to be kept in storage at a secure facility at Site-77. Three SCP-873-1 instances are to be kept in standard humanoid containment units at the same site, and are to receive human meals three times a week. SCP-873-2 instances are to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-77, and are to receive human meals three times a week. Personnel assigned to SCP-873 are not, or have not been, exposed to SCP-873's anomalous effects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-873 is a set of 14 photographs, numbered 873-1 through 873-14. Instances of SCP-873 are photographs depicting a ritualistic human sacrifice. The subject depicted in all of the photographs was a Caucasian male, aged between 25 and 35 years. All instances show different degrees of blood loss from the subject, who generally has his head separated from his body.</p><p>Only two SCP-873 photographs, SCP-873-9 through SCP-873-11, show the sacrifice preceding an instance of SCP-873. The other 12 instances do not appear to have been staged in any way.</p><p>The measurements of the subjects depicted in each photograph varies widely, and is consistent with their age and stature. Nonhumanoid and smaller nonhumanoids were most frequently depicted as subjects in SCP-873 instances.</p><p>SCP-873's anomalous effects manifest when viewed by a human subject between 25 and 35 years old. Upon viewing SCP-873, the subject will immediately be transported to the site of an SCP-873 instance, where they will be surrounded by several figures wearing hooded cloaks, who bear the faces of deceased humans they have murdered. The subject will be given a knife, which they will then proceed to stab themselves over and over again with until their life ends. Following this event, the subject will appear alive once again in the real world, with their wounds fully healed as if having never been injured by anything more than superficial cuts.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 873-A:</strong> SCP-873 was recovered from a residence in Mount Pleasant, Michigan on 11/26/1998. During initial containment, the subject\'s corpse was discovered to be missing. It was later recovered at a park near the subject\'s residence. A note was found next to the body, which read "This is not my first time."']</p>
