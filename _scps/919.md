<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-919</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-919 is to be held in a Secure Containment Locker at Site-██. It is to be kept separate from any type of media or writing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-919 is a black leather-bound book. It has an embossed title in gold letters on the spine: The Book of Life. The text of the book is written entirely in Sanskrit, but the body of the text has been translated using modern technical equipment. The text within it states that those who read it will be granted one wish each day for the rest of their lives.</p><p>The first page of SCP-919 seems to be a blank piece of paper with a number written in ink at the top right corner, 1/1. Below this number is written "Maya vidya karuna novini."</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum SCP-919-A:</strong> The Foundation recovered a number of manuscripts from an ancient library in ████████, India. As no records were kept with regard to these manuscripts, it is not known how many there may be.</p><p>The texts themselves vary from text on astrology, horoscopes and demonology, to texts on Kabbalah and Enochian magic. All texts are written in the Siddhaṃ script. The texts have been arranged in sequence as follows:</p><p>No known manuscript seems to have been destroyed or lost, as all have been recovered intact.']</p>
