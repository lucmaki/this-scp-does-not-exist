<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-56</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-56 are to be monitored for development, with the objective of neutralizing it in the event of its manifestation. Instances of SCP-56 should not be physically removed from their mediums.</p><p>Explosives may be used to render instances of SCP-56 inert, as long as a sizable quantity of the blood is preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-56 is a phenomenon that allows any blood, human or otherwise, to be transferred from one medium to another. The blood must be separated into its constituent elements in order for it to be transmitted through SCP-56 (e.g., severed limbs will not transmit if all of the limb is still intact).</p><p>If an instance of SCP-56 is contacted with blood from a different instance of SCP-56, then that new instance of SCP-56 will become active. In this case, the new instance of SCP-56 will grow to maturity within 1–5 days and then begin producing instances of SCP-56 at a rate of 60 per hour.</p><p>SCP-56 was originally discovered after reports surfaced regarding an unusually heavy rainstorm in ████████, Italy. Investigations conducted by local authorities revealed several instances of SCP-56 in the area affected by the storm. After determining that the werewolf's saliva causes these instances of SCP-56 to manifest, the vampire population was located, and containment procedures enacted.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 56-1:</strong> SCP-56 was discovered after a series of gruesome murders took place in ████████, Italy. Tracking the source of the blood to an abandoned asylum, Area-06, Foundation agents intercepted a group of alleged werewolf hunters who were attempting to contain the outbreak.</p><p>After the hunter group had been contained and transported to Site-17, Agent ██████ approached the leader of the group with a proposal. In exchange for providing the Foundation with samples of the blood that is used in their rituals, Agent ██████ offered to purchase all of the blood that they collected. Agent ██████ then proceeded to provide Foundation researchers with enough blood to create several more instances of SCP-56.']</p>
