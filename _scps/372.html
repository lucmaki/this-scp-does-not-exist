<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-372</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has established a 'perpetual containment unit' inside a large pressurized room located at Site-77. The only access to the chamber are three large doors built into a solid concrete wall. SCP-372 is contained within a steel cabinet measuring 1.5m x 1m x 0.3m, and attached to four airlocks. Any personnel entering the chamber must first pass through the airlock and then get screened by an automated system before being allowed inside the main chamber. Keycard access is mandatory for any person meeting the following requirements:</p><p>A security clearance of at least Level 4.</p><p>No association with XK-[[REDACTED]] or operations of that organization for at least ten (10) years prior to entering SCP-372's containment chamber.</p><p>No known allergies or pathology related to the eyes, skin or lungs.</p><p>No known relationship with anyone whose blood type is O, B, A, AB or any combination thereof.</p><p>In addition, all individuals entering the chamber must be provided with polaroid sunglasses by security personnel before they enter SCP-372's containment chamber. The lenses must be tinted blue, and no new filters may be used in order to ensure that the individual is maintaining compliance with </p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-372 is a male humanoid sentience of indeterminate age and race, which has been semi-permanently contained within a steel enclosure in the center of Site-77. SCP-372's containment chamber encloses the entire space found inside the original containment facility, and measures 2.5m x 1.5m x 0.3m in area. No attempt has yet been made to remove SCP-372 from its chamber.</p><p>SCP-372 displays several anomalous properties:</p><p>SCP-372's mobility is limited by its comparatively large size, as it has difficulty crawling or walking due to its mass. In addition to this, SCP-372 suffers from various degrees of blindness, inner ear malfunction, and partial paralysis in all limbs, limiting many voluntary actions. However, SCP-372 can still perceive shapes, colors and movement in slow motion for some distance using its blind spots, although this process causes great discomfort for the entity.</p><p>In terms of sensory input and perceptions, SCP-372 receives auditory input from its left (right) ear via an ultrasonic speaker placed below the cabinet. The only way to gain access to this speaker is through an airlock located on the ceiling directly above the compartment containing SCP-372 in its metal box. The speaker's sound output is muted; thus no sounds can be detected outside of SCP-372's enclosure, including conversations that take place outside of SCP-372's containment chamber. Sounds cannot then enter the metal box due to the metal and rubber seals on SCP-372's doors and windows, leading to the conclusion that it can hear all sounds made by humans inside its sealed chamber beyond a certain frequency range. Certain sounds may be perceived with greater clarity or intensity than normal depending on the specific frequency involved (See Addendum 372A).</p><p>SCP-372 does not appear to require any special foodstuffs or entertainment items; however, it apparently likes watching videos featuring deep sea life under extreme pressure and light conditions (See Addendum 372B). It has also been reported that SCP-372 enjoys watching movies about glaciers melting and ice caps forming (See Addendum 372C).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 372A:</strong> SCP-372 has been observed to perceive certain sounds as pleasant or neutral, while others as unpleasant or threatening. The table below displays a list of sounds that have been observed to cause SCP-372 discomfort (or pleasure) and the specific frequency range responsible for this effect.</p>
