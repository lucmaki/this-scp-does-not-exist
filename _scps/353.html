<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-353</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-353 is to be contained in a secured storage unit within Site-19 under the direct supervision of researcher A████. SCP-353 is allowed to travel no more than ██ miles outside its containment area at any given time by a Foundation-approved attendant. The attendant should remain in contact with a Foundation field agent stationed at the point of entry into SCP-353's containment area. Access to SCP-353 is to be granted to researchers who are approved to handle both Class III and Class IV items in their research. Relevant personnel should be made aware that the contents of SCP-353 are extremely dangerous and should avoid coming into contact with them, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-353 is an automaton comprised entirely of liquid. It was originally constructed by the Foundation after a bombing incident took place at █████████████ Elementary School in ████, California, in 20██. This bombing took place following the abduction of ████ ████████, age 7, and the discovery of ██████ █████████ and █████ ████████. The Foundation believed that the two children had been kidnapped by one of the school's janitors and sent a task force to retrieve them. In the course of their search, they discovered SCP-353 in the home of its creator, █████ █████████.</p><p>SCP-353 has a length of approximately 12 feet, with a width of 3 meters and a height of 2 meters. It is composed almost entirely of clear liquid, with four resistance metafoils extending from its sides to provide limited support and stability. SCP-353 possesses no discernible means of locomotion or mobility aside from its containment vessel, but will attempt to travel closer to people or things moving on or within a surface. SCP-353 does not appear to have a logical appearance or form, but instead appears to change its shape depending on where it is viewed from.</p><p>SCP-353's primary anomalous effect is that it displays extreme insensitivity to any sort of heat or cold. When exposed to temperatures in excess of 49 degrees Fahrenheit (which completely voids SCP-353's anomalous properties) it will attempt to remove itself from this environment by any means available, including reconstructing itself and forcing itself through gaps smaller than 0.1 mm wide at high speeds. Despite this apparent insensitivity to temperature, it retains moderate resistance towards watery environments, still attempting to leave such places if possible.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
