<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-790</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The general containment parameters for SCP-790 are the same as those of a standard Euclid classification. It is to be held in a vault at Storage Site-77, and three armed guards are to be posted outside of its chamber 24 hours a day.</p><p>The Foundation has no sensitive information regarding SCP-790. All personnel involved with SCP-790 are to be treated in a manner identical to that of amnestic patients undergoing psychogenic amnesia treatment, including a complete and thorough psychiatric evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-790 is a large, white wooden table measuring approximately 4 meters long and 3 meters wide. The surface of the table is covered in scratches and minor cracks which have no apparent cause or reason. Small metal hooks have been implanted at various points along the length of the table; these are connected to a small black box about 1 cm in size. The table appears to be alive, responding to verbal commands and displays an animistic personality (see below). The table also has an internal clockwork self-rearranging mechanism which activates when commanded by an uninvolved victim.</p><p>A person will enter SCP-790's containment chamber, approach the table, and begin making incantations over it using their hands. The victim will then reach into their pocket, withdraw a green piece of paper from within and place it on the table before retreating from the room. SCP-790 will then begin reading this paper aloud, sometimes uttering vocalizations such as large sighs and groans in response to parts of the text. When prompted by a specific word (e.g. "Him"), SCP-790 will deliver a message in [DATA EXPUNGED]. When prompted by another specific word (e.g "Gentlemen"), it will recite a short poem from 18th century travel journal entries written by Sir Walter Scott (SCP-079).</p><p>The victims report that they can feel their skin becoming warmer than normal, before finding themselves transported back in time to approximately 200 years ago when several members of the Paxton family were killed (15 males and 12 females) through an unknown means, with all but two bodies recovered via live burial near █████, Scotland while two were found elsewhere in England. All of these bodies had dried bloodstains on their clothing consistent with struggle or being dragged over long distances as well as signs of asphyxiation following strangulation involving cloth or rope around neck or body</p><p>It is unknown where the words "Gentlemen", "Him" and "Saints" originated from but notes taken during interviews suggest that no one remembers writing them on paper prior to entering SCP-980. Attempts to remove these phrases have proven unsuccessful due to its strong animistic nature.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>Please note that prior to the discovery of SCP-790, the following poem was recovered from the Paxton estate. It was originally thought to have been written by Sir Walter Scott but research has revealed that this is not the case. The following translation is from a German translation of "The Lady in the Tower" from the same collection. The original manuscript was found in a box of fictional manuscripts inside the Paxton\'s [REDACTED].</p><p>My romance with fair Lilias was but short;</p><p>She wither\'d in her pride at my feet.</p><p>She, who had been so beautiful,</p><p>Was not loved by me in vain.</p><p>My heart was crushed, and her life lost;</p><p>I left her, to seek another way.</p><p>Now I am trapped within cold stone,</p><p>I cannot rest; I would return again.</p><p>I must escape this tomb of mine,</p><p>To find my love who died so quickly.</p>
