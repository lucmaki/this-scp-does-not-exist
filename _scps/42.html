<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-42 is a phenomenon that has, since December of 2004, prevented the Foundation from successfully containing and neutralizing a Class I Keter-level SCP. The nature of this effect is currently unknown.</p><p>SCP-42 manifests as the following information.</p><p>Document 42-1: The Extinction Event Continues</p><p>It occurred so quickly. Three weeks after we arrived in Seattle, it was all over. We were working on a containment site in the Cascade Mountains when we got a call; a Class Grey was loose out west somewhere near Olympia. They said to get up there as fast as possible. I don't know if it was some new kind of virus or if it just infected them differently but it spread like wildfire through the entire city and it seemed that everyone had caught it. It was right outside our cabin; the quarantine measures we had installed there would have kept us safe but we didn't have time to do more than grab what clothes we could and run out into the woods.</p><p>We tried to fight it off but didn't stand a chance. I can still hear my partner screaming in pain as he died beside me, his head exploding in blood and brain matter next to my ear. That's when everything went dark for a moment and there was no more sound at all and then…</p><p>I don't know how long I floated out there after that but finally the world came back to me, slowly creeping back into focus like waking from a nightmare, and I looked around me at my two companions lying dead just yards away from me and half submerged in their own blood and bits of bone that were slowly floating down towards me. There was nothing else left alive anywhere around us; everyone else had done what they could and only seconds later none of them were able to move or speak anymore either.</p><p>I was alone now with this thing which was still growing behind me and spreading on the ground to meet us both; without any strength left we had no choice but to turn around and face it. As soon as we did it changed its shape, unfolded out of its cocooned form beneath the snow, expanded upwards, spread out its arms like wings, lifted itself off the ground… and flew away into the sky right above our heads.</p><p>I never saw where it went afterward because I didn't want to believe what I saw was real but suddenly there was another skull crushing down onto my face before everything went black again and when I came to again I didn't see anything but empty space surrounding myself forevermore.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 42-1:</strong> On ██/██/██, a group of civilians reported finding a bound and gagged civilian in a downtown Seattle alley. The individual was found to be severely malnourished, suffering from several broken bones and lacerations across his body as well as numerous bite marks. The civilian was found to be wearing a hooded jacket and a pair of baggy pants similar to those worn by SCP-42-1 instances.</p><p><strong>Interview 42-1:</strong></p><p>Interviewed: SCP-42-1</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Record</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> During the interview, Dr. Record was able to remove the gag from the civilian. After several attempts to communicate with the civilian, Dr. Record was able to understand that he understands English, German, and Swedish and is familiar with the languages\' alphabets and pronunciation but has no idea how to read them.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Dr. Record:</strong> Hello? Can you understand me? I\'m going to untie you now. Can you talk?</p><p><strong>SCP-42-1:</strong> Yes, I can talk.</p><p><strong>Dr. Record:</strong> OK, then listen closely: I\'ll ask you a few things and you have to tell me what they are in your language. Can you try?</p><p><strong>SCP-42-1:</strong> Yes, I can try.</p><p><strong>Dr. Record:</strong> What language do you understand?</p><p><strong>SCP-42-1:</strong> German.</p><p><strong>Dr. Record:</strong> Good job! Now I\'m going to ask you about some things I see around us and when you tell me what they are in your language I want you to repeat them back to me in English so that I can write it down for later reading. Understand?</p><p><strong>SCP-42-1:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Record:</strong> Good, now my name is Dr. Record and this is my partner who will help translate the things that we\'re going to discuss while I write them down for later reading. So let\'s begin; what\'s your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-42-1:</strong> It\'s not important right now, but it\'s not Simon like my friend told me it would be when he came here last week. He said that everything would be OK and that we were going to get out of here together when he told me all this stuff about an "extinction," "the end," "the one coming" and "the world being over soon." He also told me all about how bad everything would be afterward when there would be no more food or water or anything for us in Seattle because the whole world will just be empty, pretty much like this place is now because all the rest of the people in the world have died off already and it will die with them soon enough if we don\'t do something about it before then and that there was nothing left anyway except for me and him, but nobody else was going to care about us after that happened either so we didn\'t need anyone else at all anymore. Then he tied me up and put a bag over my head because he said I wouldn\'t have anything worth saying anymore after that happened or anyone who would ever want to hear me say anything again at all anyhow, but he didn\'t want to hurt me too much even though he wanted me dead too so he just knocked me out with a hammer first thing when he came back around here last night after they were done with all of the other things they had done here already that day…</p><p><strong>Dr. Record:</strong> Is this true? Did your friend tell you this? Did he hurt you?</p><p><strong>SCP-42-1:</strong> Yeah, he hit me on the head too hard for too long with a hammer and then he had to tie my hands up so that I wouldn\'t get away from him… but yeah, it\'s true… everything he said is true… everything… everywhere… everywhere… everywhere… EVERYWHERE! It\'s over now… it\'s over now… every single person in this whole world… they\'re gone now… they\'re all gone now… everyone is gone now… everyone is dead! Gone, gone, gone! And it\'s not like they can come back or anything… they\'re all gone forever! Gone forever like forever so long ago or never in the first place! Gone forever like forever! It\'s over now! We\'re all gone forever! Gone forever like forever until there\'s nothing left at all anymore! Forever until there\'s nothing left for us anymore! Forever until there\'s nothing left at all anymore! Forever until there\'s nothing left for us anymore! Forever until there\'s nothing left at all anymore! Forever until there\'s nothing left for us anymore!
