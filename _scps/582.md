<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-582</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-582 is to be kept in a standard containment locker set at 4 degrees Celsius and 40% humidity. A personal air purifier is to be set up in the containment locker, and two (2) humidifiers are to be placed in the storage area containing SCP-582. The humidity level of the storage area has been significantly raised, in order to retain maximum moisture within the electronics.</p><p>The entire area housing SCP-582 is to be kept sterile and free for use by staff with Project Purity clearance. In the event that any bodily fluids leak into the storage area, these should be cleaned immediately and any affected electronics checked for damage. If possible, the electronic equipment is to be replaced immediately.</p><p>Any personnel exposed to SCP-582 are to undergo decontamination procedures before entering an area designated as “clean”.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-582 is an organ donor card, printed with the name “Adrianne Cunningham” as the card holder. The name “Adrianne Cunningham” was entered from data recovered from the deceased subject, who donated one of her organs to a not yet identified recipient at ██████ ████ Hospital.</p><p>Upon exposure to bodily fluids of an individual bearing genetic traits similar to those of the deceased subject, SCP-582 will display the genetic data and current blood type of this individual. However, the displayed blood type will be inconsistent with the blood type of the donor, leading to complications in procuring a suitable organ. As of now, it is unknown whether or not there is a correlation between the pattern of DNA in collisions and organ suitability.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Test Log</p><p><strong>Test 1:</strong></p><p>Subject: D-547308, a Caucasian female with a blood type of O and a genetic pattern similar to that of the deceased donor.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was exposed to SCP-582 as noted above.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> Subject displayed the genetic data and blood type of the deceased donor.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Subject’s blood type was O+, which is consistent with the genetic data displayed. However, the displayed blood type was different from that of the donor, AB+. This is most likely due to the fact that storage of this data was done on a different blood type system than that used by the Foundation. In addition, subject’s blood type is A+, which is compatible with the genetic data that would be displayed if stored on a different blood type system.</p><p><strong>Test 2:</strong></p><p>Subject: D-551255, an African-American male with an incompatible genetic pattern and blood type.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject was exposed to SCP-582 as noted above.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> DNA data and blood type as displayed by SCP-582 was compatible with that of the subject; however, both were incompatible with the donor’s DNA and blood type.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Both subjects bear genes of the same base pairs, however D-551255’s genes are miscopied, leading to the incompatibility when compared to the donor’s genetic data. It is likely that this incompatibility was due to the use of completely different gene sequencing methods.</p><p><strong>Test 3:</strong></p><p>Subject: D-558299, a Caucasian male with genetic patterns similar to those of both donors and recipient.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Both subject and donor were exposed to SCP-582 as noted above.</p><p><strong>Result:</strong> DNA data and blood types as displayed by SCP-582 were consistent with those of both subjects; however, when compared with the donor’s genetic data, there was no match between subjects and donor. The reason for this has not yet been determined.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The subjects did not display any genetic information or blood types that matched those of either subject or organ recipient. This could mean that they do not have any genetic patterns similar to those of either recipient or donor, or that there is no compatibility between these two individuals. However, this test has only been performed once, and it is highly likely that such compatibility would have been demonstrated in more experiments. As such, we will have to keep searching for compatible organs until we find one.']</p>
