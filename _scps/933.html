<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-933</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-933 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, the key for which is currently held by Dr. ██████. A video camera trained on the object at all times is to be positioned in the research area, and personnel are to avoid approaching it for testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-933 appears to be a short length of string attached to a dog, approximately 3m long. Neither end of the object is visible. It appears to respond to verbal commands (including two instances in which the object uttered one word for 10 consecutive minutes).</p><p>When SCP-933 moves, it does so with great precision, traveling along the ground at speeds up to 15km/h before stopping. Its movement has been observed to closely resemble the movements of a dog when on command. When not moving, it hangs limply in place.</p><p>SCP-933 was recovered from an abandoned farmhouse in ████████, England after reports of a "psychic dog" had been passed along local police departments by one [REDACTED], who had received them from [REDACTED].</p><p>MTF Beta-7 ("Psychonauts") has been assigned to investigate and test SCP-933. Exposure to any object related to domestic pets (especially dogs) has demonstrated that SCP-933 will respond accordingly. This response differs for each individual.</p><p>Interview 933-2: Written by Dr. ████████</p><p>Dated: ██/██/20██</p><p>[Dr. ████████ is sitting at a table with a notebook and pen.]</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr. ███████n: Hello?

<p> <strong>Addendum 933-1:</strong> Interview 933-2 has been recorded and is available for viewing in the Project Archivist. The quote attributed to SCP-933 was originally reported as being "No sense getting yelled at twice" but it has since been discovered that the quote is actually "No sense getting yelled at twice, again". This was confirmed when a transcript was discovered of an interview with SCP-933\'s former handler in which she is much more upset at the interviewer than SCP-933. A link to the interview can be found below.</p>
