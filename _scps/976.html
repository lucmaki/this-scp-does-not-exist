<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-976</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-976 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment chamber.</p><p>During testing, SCP-976 is to be kept covered with a cloth bag. This will prevent any accidental exposure. SCP-976 is allowed to be handled by personnel with Class 3 or higher O.C.D.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-976 appears as a plastic bag measuring 1.2m x 0.5m x 0.4m, with 30cm of those dimensions being the container's surface. The object appeared in ██████, ████████ on 4/3/1989.</p><p>When the bag is opened, SCP-976 will manifest a pair of goggles inside the container that appear to be made of plastic and rubber. These are functional, but are not as durable as human eyes. When worn by an organism, SCP-976's effects will be suppressed by the subject's ocular physiology.</p><p>SCP-976's effects can only be detected by creatures that do not possess ocular organs or other means of detecting light; those affected will not recall having seen SCP-976. Light detection is suppressed even further if SCP-976 is worn over the eyes of such a creature, leading to the belief that SCP-976's wearer is blind.</p><p>The effect of SCP-976 lasts until the subject removes it from their eyes or until they die. In both cases, it will immediately affect all organisms within 3 meters of its wearer. If a subject wearing SCP-976 dies, all other subjects within 30m of its owner will become unable to see light and experience blindness for 7 days after their death.</p><p>SCP-976 was recovered from the home of Mr ████████ ███████████, who reportedly used it to pass on his knowledge about the universe to his friends and family members.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-976 Test Log</p><p>Test 1 - Subject D-69567, a female rabbit.</p><p>Subject was placed inside a small glass room with several sources of light, 70cm from SCP-976. After 30 minutes or so, subject's corneas began to ripen, starting with the focus point. The subject's vision began to blur and eventually enveloped the entire area into darkness. No positive visual response has been observed after this point. Subject has since been euthanized because she was literally blind.</p><p>Test 2 - Mr ████ ██████████████, a human male who suffered from ocular albinism. Mr ██████████████ was removed from his cell and exposed for 30 seconds before being returned to his cell. Mr ██████████████ experienced no visual effects during this test.</p><p>Test 3 - D-56746, an African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis).</p><p>D-56746 was placed on a plastic sheet in an area with artificial lighting that could be clearly seen by the frog without any problems. 30 minutes later, D-56746 had completely lost its ability to see light, and was currently unable to move or breathe. SCP-976's effects were also present in D-56746's surroundings, creating a space equivalent to 24m x 24m x 24m which was dark after exposure, although the area itself was filled with light according to all individual perception levels. Under questioning of Dr ███████ and Dr ████████ (who both stated they could not detect any light in the affected area), it was found that even when not directly exposed to SCP-976, all life inside the space was still alive, albeit temporarily blinded. Thus we conclude that SCP-976 is capable of affecting solid matter as well as living organisms. This fact is of extreme value because we might assume that SCP-976 could be used by those trying to view other locations or even other dimensions through remote means; however the light suppression would mean that it would act more like [DATA EXPUNGED]. So long as SCP-976 remained under containment testing should continue until we have a way of producing and using it in useful work.</p>
