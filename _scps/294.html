SCP-294 is allowed to roam the perimeter of the testing room, but is not to be exposed to any of the objects in SCP-294's containment chamber. Should SCP-294 display any abnormal behavior or react violently towards an individual, all personnel are to immediately remove said individual from the scene and notify local law enforcement.</p><p>All subjects testing on SCP-294 are to use an animal model with a weight ratio of 100g of animal weight per 1kg of human subject. Subject should be transported via a standard cargo flight between the three (3) testing sites designated for SCP-294. Each test subject should bear the name and address of their respective test site. Any unauthorized visitors are considered hostile and are to be terminated on sight.</p><p>Should research staff encounter any anomalous activity in or around SCP-294, they are to immediately report the event via emergency response protocols.</p>
