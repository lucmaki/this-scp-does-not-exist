<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-487</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-487 is contained in a standard containment cell with a monitoring station and telephone. Tests are performed on at least one (1) SCP-487 instance per week.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-487 is a set of seven (7) standard black and white Chinese remainder tables (also known as Tong-Fu). The tables are made of wood, with the exception of SCP-487 instances 8, 12, and 15. All participants in SCP-487 instances 1 through 6 are Chinese, while all participants in SCP-487 instances 7 through 14 are American or European. SCP-487 instances 8 and 12 appear to be manufactured by the same factory, but there is no correlation between the use of these two tables. It is currently unknown how SCP-487 instances 1 through 6 were manufactured at such different times. It is also unknown why test subjects from these different geographic regions are participating in the same experiment; however, it has been observed that approximately 10% of the participants do not share both a language and a nationality with any other participants.</p><p>All test subjects who participate in SCP-487 are divided into two groups of five (5), with each group taking turns reading from one of the seven SCP-487 instances. Subjects then write down their interpretations on plain white note cards which resemble regular Chinese business cards. The interpretation must be written completely in Chinese characters without abbreviation, and must be written within 300 words (excluding punctuation). After writing their interpretations, each participant places the card on top of an SCP-487 instance, leaving only the amount paid on the table intact.</p><p>SCP-487 can only be used once per month and requires three (3) consecutive days to complete each time. Once done, a new set will begin immediately.</p><p>A random selection of up to 100 individuals is required to run tests every month. One individual will act as a moderator; they will take note of all changes made to the original cards from which new interpretations were obtained before replacing them back onto an instance. As long as one moderator remains active for 372 days, processing will continue uninterrupted.</p><p>Note: All tests should occur during daylight hours.</p>
