<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-845</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-845 is to be stored in a locked cabinet in the basement of Site-19. Only four (4) bottles are to be available at any time, with only one (1) bottle on display in the containment room at any given time. The database that contains the recipe is to be backed up daily using a magnetic drive, and is to be locked down during storage, as well as when not being used as a backup.</p><p>The Foundation has been working with Dr. ████████ to determine alternatives to SCP-845, including a non-homeopathic homeopathic dilution of the original formula but with no changes to the recipe's content. Samples of these alternatives are currently being evaluated for their effectiveness at stopping SCP-845's effects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-845 is a homeopathic preparation, consisting entirely of Lachesis muta and Culex pipiens. The bottle in which SCP-845 is contained (designated SCP-845-1) was produced by the "Saint Louis Homeo Pharmacy" in St. Louis, Missouri on June 8th, 1894. Only one (1) bottle of SCP-845 has ever been produced, and it is believed that it was originally intended to contain only a single dose.</p><p>When administered to a human subject, SCP-845 will instead create a protective layer around their body to prevent dehydration through perspiration. The subject's skin will not lose moisture through sweating; instead, any liquid secreted from the subject's body will be absorbed by SCP-845. This process is not reversible without drastic measures; subjects remain safe from dehydration at all times even if the protection wears off for any reason.</p><p>A side effect of this process is that any liquids the subject consumes directly into their mouth are completely absorbed by its pores and converted into water molecules inside their bodies. A human who consumes water directly through an open wound or mouth will have all its moisture removed; consumption of liquids not directly ingested into the mouth will also not cause dehydration when consumed.</p><p>SCP-845 affects every organic matter within its vicinity - including plants - to some extent; while this fact can be observed, no thorough understanding has been gained of exactly how it works yet.</p><p>The effects of SCP-845 can be reversed with sufficient force or heat; however, heat causes severe tissue damage and also causes SCP-845 its popularity as "homeopathic" treatment for burns in third world countries. Reversing SCP-845 using such methods should always be carried out in a secure facility equipped with ventilators or other machinery capable of preventing burn victims from suffocating until help arrives. To date, there has never been an instance where the reversal was carried out successfully.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
