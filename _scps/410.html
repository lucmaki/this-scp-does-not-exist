<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-410</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-410 is contained in a standard containment locker. A remote GPS transceiver is embedded into the anomaly at all times, and tracking devices have been placed on the remains of SCP-410's original fishing vessels. A small room has been constructed to house the bodies of SCP-410's crew and their equipment.</p><p>The bodies are to be kept in a state of decompression at 25 m/s, and monitored at all times for unknown reasons. Blood samples are collected weekly to monitor changes in their composition.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-410 is a fleet of two ghost fishing vessels, designated SCP-410-1 and -2. The vessels are composed of the same materials as regular fishing boats (see Containment Log 410A for details), but have been modified to function as normal boats, with the exception of loss of propulsion.</p><p>All crew members are presumed deceased. They do not respond to any stimuli from the outside world, including sonar or visual contact. They retain all memories they had while alive, but they cannot move or speak without the vessel's assistance. They appear as if they are asleep (see Containment Log 410B for details).</p><p>When the hulls of SCP-410-1 and -2 breach the surface of the ocean, they will teleport to another location. This location is determined by the location of their original vessel's location when they last were alive; in this way, it is believed that they are able to return to their home galaxy through a wormhole they created themselves at death. If a side effect would be too great after entering a new dimension, such as changing its gravitational pull or an event involving a nuclear explosion, then the entity will instead simply stay on the surface of the water until it can return home safely.</p><p>SCP-410 began affecting shipping traffic in 1952, when it first manifested along Route ██ of [REDACTED], ██████ over ███ days. A research vessel was sent to investigate, but lost radio contact and disappeared shortly after arriving at the area where SCP-410 was located at that time. After several failed attempts, SCP authorities elected to contain SCP-410 through seclusion. This was accomplished in 1955 by sinking one ship and taking all personnel with it. Several civilians were killed upon impact due to being inside homes nearby; Foundation cover stories were established using these deaths as an "accident" during recovery efforts.</p><p>The surrounding area was heavily damaged due to radiation levels produced by a nearby nuclear test site; molds and other biological contaminants were found on several objects during recovery operations in 1954 and 1955 (see Containment Log 410C). Inexplicable chunks of wood can be found throughout the ocean floor, though these are believed extinct prior to discovery.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-410 was found to have been located approximately 1.5 million light years away from where it was originally discovered. The Foundation launched an operation to retrieve the anomaly in 1973 (see Containment Log 410D).</p><p>After several hours of navigation, SCP-410 was recovered intact, though several crew members were found dead from blood loss and decompression. All remaining personnel were placed in a cryogenic chamber to prevent further damage. The anomaly is currently being kept in a standard containment locker.</p><p><strong>Containment Log 410A:</strong></p><p>Acquiring the anomaly proved to be quite difficult, as its teleportation method does not permit it to be easily captured. After nearly three months of searching, the Foundation launched an investigation into a fishing vessel that had been found adrift near the shore of [REDACTED], ██████ by local civilians. Inside the ship, it was discovered that all personnel had been killed, including the captain and his family. The ship's sonar equipment had been disabled; a trail of blood could be seen leading out of the main cabin and into the front bulkhead.</p><p>The bodies were taken to Site-██ for examination, and another ship was sent out to investigate any remaining anomalies. When the second ship appeared through the anomaly, it too was teleported away before Foundation agents could reach it; its wreckage was also destroyed before capture.</p><p>This incident prompted a massive investigation into other ships that had been lost near or at the same time; no other anomalies were located in this area at the time. Shortly after the discovery of SCP-410, several fishermen had begun reporting similar encounters with ghostly vessels nearby; these cases were not taken seriously, however. In 1975, a new Foundation facility was established on [REDACTED] Island for the purpose of investigating such phenomena more thoroughly."]</p>
