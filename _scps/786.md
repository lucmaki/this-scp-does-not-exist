<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-786</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-786 is to be kept in a sealed metal box. In the rare event that it is opened with an unauthorized key, it is to be immediately sealed and secured by security personnel. Attempts at counter-surveillance by SCP-786's owner are to be targeted and suppressed, with no exceptions.</p><p>The Foundation has recently come into contact with ██████ Corporation's Advanced Research division, who have expressed an interest in funding studies of the anomalies on the object. They have been made aware of its anomalous properties.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-786 is an unmarked steel briefcase with a simple lock. If anyone other than the owner attempts to open it using a key, it will vibrate until the lock opens. It will then reveal itself to be a telephone, which can make and receive calls. The number of times this has happened is currently unknown.</p><p>The phone lines used by SCP-786 have been charged by security personnel on a pay-per-use basis. It is currently unknown how much information has been received from SCP-786's phone conversations; research into this anomaly was not initially classified as top priority due to the fact that they occurred while the object was in Foundation hands.</p><p>Further investigation indicates that SCP-786 may only work with certain phones; it has been made sure that any one who accesses its abilities must have at least one line registered to them, and no further information on SCP-786's anomalous properties can be obtained from it beyond what has already been documented.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 786-1:</strong> The phone number for SCP-786 is ██████████, which belonged to a █████ ████████. SCP-786's anomalous properties are believed to have originated from the first call made to the number; all further calls have been made to the same number.</p><p>The last entry in the ████████'s phone log reads as follows:</p><p>12/31/08 - 12:00 AM</p><p>I'm just sick of sitting here and doing nothing. I'm going to take a vacation and go on a road trip. Want to come? If so, I'll be at my house in ██████, near █████████.</p><p>████"]</p>
