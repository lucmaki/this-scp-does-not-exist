<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-713</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All instances of SCP-713 are currently contained within a large containment locker at Site ██. Individual instances of SCP-713 have been individually contained in their respective lockers, with exceptions for "Greg 1" and "Greg 4," who are collectively contained in a single containment unit with one table and four chairs.</p><p>The following conditions must be met prior to an instance of SCP-713 being released from containment:</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Instances of SCP-713 are human males aged 17 to 42 years old. Instances of SCP-713 display no bodily deformities or abnormalities, although these individuals do have an unusual habit of urinating through the nose. All instances of SCP-713 uniformly exhibit a love for all things pizza and beer, especially when it comes to pizza 'dough' and pizza beer (see Addendum). While not uncommon, instances of SCP-713 will invariably consume at least one slice of pizza or one bottle of beer on a daily basis if not more.</p><p>Instances of SCP-713 are also incapable of drinking water due to the lack of a nasal cavity, which is present in every instance. Due to this, every instance is unable to absorb any nutrients from items that are consumed in other forms than liquid. Despite this, none have suffered permanent damage or health problems as a result.</p><p>In addition to their weakness to liquids, instances of SCP-713 also possess an intense dislike for all things feminine such as the sound produced from female laughter, female flatulence, and the smell of women's perfume; however, an extremely high amount of alcohol will break their aversion to these things.</p><p>Instances of SCP-713 cannot discern between sight and smell. If an instance is blindfolded, it will make every attempt to remove the blindfold and examine its surroundings with its nose. If a subject is blindfolded with scented substances on the hand that touches the eye covering the subject's eyesight, the instance will be able to remove the blindfold and take a sniff at the substance. This behavior has lead to several experiments into "objective" tests using anomalous objects in order to determine whether or not an anomaly can be detected through an object's smell rather than just sight. These attempts have been unsuccessful up until date.</p><p>While most individuals are disgusted by their actions or by what they may consider uncleanness or vulgarity, there are some instances that exhibit an extreme urge to emit certain smells at random times or in specific areas; this has lead some researchers to speculate that these individuals are suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome or a similar condition.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-713 was first discovered by Dr. ██████, the current head of Site ██\'s site security department, while visiting a local pizzeria in order to take a break from his current job as Site ██\'s site physician. Dr. ██████ did not order any food nor did he eat anything but a slice of pizza at the establishment. As soon as his slice was finished, an instance of SCP-713 walked up to him and asked for directions to the restrooms. Dr. ██████ was confused by this until he asked what it was doing there and it replied that it had to go "the bathroom."</p><p>Dr. ██████ then decided to sit in a booth and order some pizza in order to determine whether or not this was a normal event for an instance of SCP-713 to be in a restaurant. The following is what was observed during an observation period of 15 minutes:</p><p>The following is a transcript of the observation period:</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>03-██-199█ - 02:55 AM</p><p>Dr. ██████ is currently observing several instances of SCP-713 in a restaurant after being denied service due to the establishment being understaffed. After waiting approximately 3 minutes, an instance of SCP-713 walks up to the cashier\'s stand, orders a slice of pepperoni pizza with extra cheese, and takes a seat at a booth next to Dr. ██████. Dr. ██████ asks if this is a common occurrence for instances of SCP-713 to be in restaurants and receives no reply from the individual.</p><p>03-██-199█ - 03:01 AM</p><p>Several minutes later, another instance of SCP-713 walks up behind Dr. ██████ and begins sniffing at his neck and shoulder areas; this prompts Dr. ██████ to turn around and view its face. Instances of SCP-713 have shown no facial features or signs of intelligence or emotion, although they can make facial expressions if they feel like it (see Addendum). Approximately three seconds after Dr. ██████ turns around, the individual falls asleep next to him, presumably due to extreme alcohol intoxication.</p><p>03-██-199█ - 03:21 AM</p><p>Dr. ██████ wakes up from this incident and begins writing down notes on what he just witnessed; he immediately realizes that no one else has been affected by this event and concludes that it must have been something unique to himself and other Foundation personnel that were present at the time, specifically because no one else had seen it happen before or since Dr. ██████ had visited the establishment (see Addendum). At this point, the subject disappears from sight behind Dr. ██████ and walks back over to his position. It attempts to make eye contact with Dr. ██████, but drifts off into unconsciousness before he could do so.</p><p>03-██-199█ - 03:23 AM</p><p>Dr. ██████ sits back down and continues observing instances of SCP-713 on their own accord; they all seem to be too intoxicated or otherwise inebriated to notice his presence any longer when he sits down at a different table near them once again. A few minutes later, an instance of SCP-713 initiates conversation with Dr. ██████ by asking if he would be willing to buy him another beer; however, Dr. ██████ declines the offer due to how inebriated all instances are as well as requiring his attention towards other instances so as not to disturb their conversation with other individuals who were also present in the restaurant at that time (see Addendum). These incidents occur every 15 minutes for approximatley 4 hours; however, none of these instances are able to talk about what they saw or heard during their conversation with Dr. ██████ outside of repeatedly stating how drunk they were or their inability to remember what they saw or heard during their conversation with him due to their inebriation (see Addendum).</p><p>03-██-199█ - 04:00 AM</p><p>As soon as all instances of SCP-713 have fallen unconscious due to their inebriation, Dr. ██████ calls for backup and authorities because he believes that one of them has attempted to poison him with some form of alcohol that caused him hallucinations, although he did not obtain any traces whatsoever on his body during this event; additionally, no instances became sick after these events happened despite being extremely intoxicated (see Addendum). These events occurred again every 15 minutes for another 4 hours until all instances were unconscious due to their alcohol consumption; however, no hallucinations were experienced again after this time period (see Addendum). At approximately 10AM, all instances disappeared from sight after having spent approximately 5 hours asleep on top of each other while in the same booth ']</p>
