<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-299</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-299 is to be kept in a 4m x 4m x 2m standard containment chamber, with one security guard to be stationed outside the chamber at all times. The chamber is to be made of non-conductive materials, such as glass and steel, if possible. Any objects SCP-299 interacts with are to be stored within its containment chamber when not being used by SCP-299.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-299 is a winged humanoid resembling a human male of approximately 6 ft in height. SCP-299 possesses the ability to manipulate air and air currents, as well as being able to shape its wings (whether these are organic or otherwise is not currently known). It is capable of extending these wings at will, though they will always appear to be part of its body. They have the ability to carry a single person on each wing, even without lifting said person's weight. This can be achieved by pressing one's knees against the underside of SCP-299's wings and gripping around them, allowing it to still move with speed. While carrying someone with SCP-299, it can travel up to high speeds and fly for up to three hours before needing to rest. There appears to be no limit on how many times SCP-299 can do this, though it has been noted that this limit depends on how much adrenaline it has; apparently, more adrenaline results in more potential uses for its abilities.</p><p>SCP-299 typically does not engage in anomalous activity unless provoked. Typically, when provoked such as being placed in solitary confinement, it will attempt to escape through sheer force of will alone. If unable to escape from its confinement, it will attempt to find a way out using air currents and other natural forces until found by guards. When found by guards or discovered online due to its anomalous nature, it will attempt escape again until found again and contained once more.</p><p>SCP-299 was originally discovered in June 2011 when photos of an unidentified male flying in Los Angeles were posted online along with several news articles reporting on him and his "wings." Upon contacting the police department where this occurred, we were told that all attempts at capture had failed; they deemed it a hoax but were unable to prevent the spread of information throughout the internet, upon which SCP-299 was contained under the designation of "Lord of the Fly" following Incident 3/███/███.</p><p>SCP-299 was taken from Foundation custody on █/██/██ after eyewitness reports placed SCP-299 behind a dumpster in ██████ Barbecue, where it attempted to steal a woman's purse and escape through the wind after knocking her unconscious with wind pressure. An armed security guard subdued SCP-299 with tear gas before placing it inside a containment unit, whereupon it calmed down after seeing it was no longer outdoors. Upon further questioning, SCP-297 claimed that he had lived in ███████ since his birth, having begun learning words like "wind" at an early age from other birds there due to their similar language patterns; however, his family never knew anything about him being anomalous due to them not living near any sources of anomalous activity and he did not reveal himself to them until he was picked up by Foundation agents later that day.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 299-1:</strong> As of ██/██/████, SCP-299 is to be kept in a smaller containment chamber with a small table and chair. A guard will be stationed outside of the containment unit on a regular basis.</p>
