<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-300</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Contact with SCP-300 is to be attempted through the use of anomaly-tracking satellites and on-site Foundation personnel. The above-ground (land) portions of SCP-300 are to be maintained in a state of low-level demagnetization with the use of electromagnetically charged geomagnetic neutralizers and de-geomagnetized concrete barriers. A two kilometer subterranean section (the "subterranean portion") has been constructed using materials that react negatively with osmotic demagnetization techniques. Any personnel operating within this area must provide their own protective magnetic shielding, though standard containment procedures remain in effect.</p><p>The subterranean portion is permitted to become demagnetized without significant incident as long as an atmosphere is maintained in the caverns at a rate of 500m/s2 or less at all times. Any breach of the atmosphere rate by more than 20% will result in the shutdown of the automated systems used for the maintenance of the atmosphere and the recovery of any personnel still in situ. In addition, any breach of this level will cause electromagnetic disturbance within the subterranean part, lowering its population to 0 until such time as the breach has been repaired.</p><p>The deployment of personnel into the underground portion is prohibited due to hazards posed by electromagnetic fields at both low and high levels and several missions have resulted in personnel being lost for some time before rescue due to noxious gas buildup.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-300 is an anomalous region of geomagnetically charged space, located in the boundary between the Earth and Moon. As of 1/1/2011, it has a perimeter at least 1,983 kilometers long and occupies a volume comparable to that of Gibraltar. A variety of electromagnetic signals have been detected in the vicinity of SCP-300. These signals, apparently arising from objects within the interior of SCP-300, persist for relatively short periods of time and are affected by alterations to the local ambient electromagnetic field. No object of known size has yet been detected within SCP-300.</p><p>The level and pattern of demagnetization on the outside surface of SCP-300 are dependent upon the local magnetic field both above ground and below it. This effect is largely offset by the presence of an artificial atmosphere maintained by automated systems at all times. Emergency overrides call for the replacement of the artificial atmosphere with nitrogen gas before permitting personnel entrance into SCP-300. The last atmospheric breach occurred on 12/4/09 at 09:59:01 due to a malfunctioning dehumidifier resulting in a human body becoming entrapped in concrete employed during construction work on SCP-300 several hundred years previously. This body was recovered 2 weeks later along with several other gravestones and markers bearing dates ranging from 1794 to 1815.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 300-A:</strong> In May of 2010, an anomalous signal was detected in the vicinity of SCP-300. It is believed to have originated from an electromagnetic object within SCP-300. The signal has been monitored by satellites since this time and the object (designated as SCP-300-1) has been sighted several times during that time.']</p>
