<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-792</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation has purchased the land surrounding SCP-792 to prevent its disintegration. The land surrounding SCP-792 is formally designated as Site-792. Personnel visiting the area are to inform their superiors of the border location of Site-792.</p><p>Foundation personnel are to report any changes in landscape within a one kilometre radius of SCP-792. Geologists are to be kept fully informed of any changes observed on a regional basis and will be given temporary containment until such times when further study is deemed appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-792 is an area of 3,800 square kilometers in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China. A large number of oil wells have been assembled in the area and are connected to a drilling rig. The rig consists of a steel tower with a drill mounted at the top. The facility is manned by one technician, who will be designated SCP-772.</p><p>SCP-772 will stay in its position on the rig until 992 Chinese yuan is deposited into any of the two security boxes along the base's perimeter. These boxes are inaccessible to non-Foundation personnel at this time. If neither box is opened, SCP-772 will commence drilling activities until either box has been emptied. Investigation into what triggers SCP-772's actions is ongoing. This behavior is limited to the area around SCP-772's location and does not extend to any other nearby areas or structures.</p><p>It should be noted that while SCP-772 has been observed working within an area of ████ square kilometers, there have been no recorded cases of SCP-772 being present outside this space.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-772 was provided with a detailed map of the area in which it is to perform drilling operations. It was found that the area within which SCP-792 is located has been designated as Site-792. This designation has been extended to encompass the area surrounding SCP-792, including the surrounding area and land in China and Kazakhstan.</p>
