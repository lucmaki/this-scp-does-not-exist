<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-137</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-137 is to be kept in a standard research storage vault at Site-77. Any staff working on SCP-137 are to keep track of their heart rate, blood pressure and other vital signs. SCP-137 may be viewed at all times, but photographs are prohibited.</p><p>Testing may only occur when the subject is under heavy sedation. Restraining chairs are to be set up in order to keep the subject still during testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-137 is a stuffed animal, seemingly a dog. It is sapient and capable of speech, despite appearances to the contrary. A search of its genes shows it to be a 50% genetic match with a dog and a 50% genetic match with a cat. SCP-137 is made up of an extremely high proportion of mammalian DNA; both the DNA of other mammals and non-mammalian species are accounted for, as well as higher vertebrate DNA. Its appearance is consistent with that of a large dog, with thick fur and short legs.</p><p>SCP-137 has been observed to move when no one is observing it, and will reach towards any person in the room. In this state it seems curious about what is going on and ambivalent about the presence of humans around it. It will often speak to the subject in question without fail, but does not seem to require any particular response from the subject, simply being pleased by their presence. When under observation by another person or persons, SCP-137 will attempt to interact with them through overly enthusiastic play or attempts to communicate feelings which may be misinterpreted as genuine affection from SCP-137.</p><p>While SCP-137 can communicate in human languages, it makes use of sign language extensively when communicating with people outside its species. It has also been known to 'hear' human speech in this way.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-137 was discovered at the home of an elderly woman. The Foundation had been monitoring reports of a patient in a nearby nursing home who had been displaying unusual behavior. When the Foundation agents moved in to investigate, SCP-137 was found in its owner\'s bedroom, sleeping with her. It was determined that the patient was suffering from senile dementia and that SCP-137 had been in the room for several months prior to Foundation intervention.</p><p>When questioned about its origins, SCP-137 would only reply "I just always wanted a dog. I bought it and loved it."']</p>
