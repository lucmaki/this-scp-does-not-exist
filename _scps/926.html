<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-926</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation web crawlers have been programmed to index SCP-926-1, a website listing all the "good deals" at once. Link identification is currently done by the Foundation's servers. Access to the site requires a Foundation login. After logging in with a user name and password provided to the user by the Foundation, the user's logins and cookies can be monitored for unauthorized access.</p><p>All users of SCP-926-1 are to be given documentation on non-Foundation friendly high speed data usage.</p><p>At this time, there is no reason to believe that SCP-926-1 is being used for any purpose other than trading sites.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-926-1 is a website that accepts user logins and serves as a platform for users to find "good deals" on various products. It allows users to search for items they wish to purchase, set up the cheapest price they would be willing to pay, and send an offer through a messaging system.</p><p>The site works via an MCI protocol that allows for rapid data transfer with minimal computational power. Most trades are made over the phone.</p><p>SCP-926-1 allows for the logging of multiple offers at once by allowing users to add multiple items to their requests in a single trade message. SCP-926-1 prevents users from seeing each other's offers, but is able to spot when one of the offers is equal or higher than another offer by comparing prices.</p><p>Users are never able to receive more than one deal at once under any circumstances; the site compares all offers and shows the best deal if there are any equally good ones.</p><p>SCP-926-1 currently has an estimated 15,000 active users.</p>
