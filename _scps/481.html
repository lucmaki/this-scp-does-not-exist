<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-481</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-481 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-77, containing only a change of clothing and toiletries. An alarm system has been installed to notify researchers when SCP-481 is not present in its plexiglass containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-481 is a humanoid ectoplasmic entity, estimated to be approximately 200 cm tall, weighing 45 kg at the time of acquisition. SCP-481 is non-sentient, biologically inert and physically incorporeal. It was discovered in an abandoned warehouse in ████, California during an investigation regarding disappearances and break-ins.</p><p>SCP-481 exhibits no discernible will or personality, but appears capable of thought and speech. It prefers to communicate through written text and will actively seek out human beings to converse with. SCP-481 has proven capable of telepathically communicating with other humans via writing on paper or directly imprinting its thoughts onto the subconscious mind of anyone it meets - if the speech centers of their brains are activated; this process is harmless to the recipient. The more people who are provided with this service, the greater the length and complexity of the text messages delivered.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
