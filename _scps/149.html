<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-149</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-149 is to be kept in a standard object containment locker, with the exception of testing in which SCP-149 may be moved from its container. Testing involving SCP-149 may only be performed once every ten days, and must be approved by at least one Level 2 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-149 is a bookshelf that, when opened, will emit a loud noise until its contents have been physically rearranged. If a human being interacts with the object while it has been selected in a testing zone and is not already contained, they will feel compelled to rearrange their surrounding environment to provide the space needed for the storage of the required contents. Of those tested so far, there appears to be no limit on how much of the surrounding area may be rearranged in this way.</p><p>The process through which SCP-149 arranges itself has yet to be fully documented; however, insofar as can be guessed from other tests, it involves the object's opening itself up to as much space as is needed for its new contents. The resulting rearrangement has been described as similar in appearance to [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>When used for research purposes only, SCP-149 may be moved at any time from its container. When used for testing purposes, no more than 10 objects may be stored within SCP-149 at any given time during testing; any additional items placed in SCP-149 will remain inside until their container is emptied.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 149-1:</strong></p><p>A log of all known tests of SCP-149 has been compiled, and is available in the following link:</p><p><strong>https:</strong>//www.scp-wiki.net/logs/log/id/149</p>
