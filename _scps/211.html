<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-211</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The land surrounding SCP-211 is set aside for farming by Site-53 staff. As a result, Foundation agents operating within this region should not advertise their interest in cases of spontaneous combustion.</p><p>Any instances of SCP-211-1 affected by Foundation personnel are to be briefed on the situation, then given Class C amnestics and relocated to other areas.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-211 is a large, rocky island in the Baltic Sea. SCP-211 is located approximately 200Â km west of the main landmass of mainland Europe and has no discernible means of producing its own food or shelter.</p><p>SCP-211 has the unusual property of being able to create and maintain a habitable ecosystem by using its native ecology. These ecosystems vary wildly between each generation; some are extremely unique, while others can be duplicated by other islands within the Baltic Sea. The primary flora on SCP-211 includes:</p><p>Carboniferous forests usually make up most of SCP-211's plant life, with an occasional example of upland oak ("Quercus robur"). However, these areas are often replaced by 3 meter high "Hedophyllum" plants which are remarkably resilient to fire and disease. These meadows are covered in various types of mosses and ferns, as well as birds. Amphibians include:</p><p>Frogs and salamanders are extremely common in unpopulated areas and occupy a wide range of environments. The amphibian population is moderately varied, aside from several species similar to modern frogs but more closely related to lungfishes; these species cannot survive outside of fresh water.</p><p>The avian fauna is almost equally diverse; over forty species live on SCP-211 at any given time, including nearly all species described in class A research papers. Most common birds include:</p><p>Smaller arthropods include: Insectivorous bats, carnivorous bats (Eidolon helvum) and two types of shrews. Mollusk fauna includes:</p><p>SCP-211's dominant vertebrate fauna includes:</p><p>These animals comprise roughly half the island's population; smaller organisms that prey on them include:</p><p>It is not uncommon for rats ("Rattus norvegicus") to gain access to uncontained areas on SCP-211. Though they are not able to survive for long periods inside active ecosystems, they are capable of breeding with the other species inhabiting SCP-211 and making up anywhere from 10% to 90% of its population. A large portion of the rodent population are rats belonging to the giant black rat ("Rattus rattus"). Their diet consists primarily of subadults from the amphibian population, until larger amphibians can be found.</p><p>In addition to mammals, SCP-211 also hosts numerous mites and insects which feed on flesh, excrete webbing or burrow through clothing. SCP-211's proximity to farmland causes it to have a higher diversity of arachnids than many other islands; these include spiders, harvestmen, scorpions and tarantulas: </p><p>Tarantulas are only known to live on naturally formed tarantula habitats such as those on SCP-211; they will not thrive outside this environment unless artificially created conditions have been provided beforehand. Tarantulas originally from outside Baltic Sea regions all produce silk when threatened or disturbed, much like their terrestrial cousins. Tarantulas fed exclusively off spiders and mites before arriving on SCP-211.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 211-A:</strong> The origin of SCP-211's ecology is still largely a mystery; the only clues available are:</p>
