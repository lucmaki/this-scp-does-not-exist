<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-63</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-63 is contained in an isolation chamber measuring 2.5m x 2.5m x 1m, modified for soundproofing purposes. The floor and walls are to be lined with sound-absorbing insulation. A ceiling fan must be fitted to ensure the soundproofing is maintained. Every 6 hours, SCP-63 is to be fed a varied diet of spoiled food of some sort, preferably of packaging material. No human contact is permitted. Two (2) security personnel are to present in the containment chamber at all times, and be equipped with a tranq gun for any instances of [REDACTED].</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-63 is a large moth of an indeterminate species. The specimen measured over 45cm in length, and weighed in excess of [REDACTED]. SCP-63 has a wingspan of 20cm, with a wing tip measuring in excess of [REDACTED]. SCP-63 possesses no eyes, ear lobes or nostril cavities. The wings are translucent blue. SCP-63 moves using two pairs of legs, though only one pair may be used for walking at any given time.</p><p>SCP-63 is covered on all sides by a mass of multiple skin layers (most easily seen on its abdomen), each measuring approximately 1 cm thick. Each layer appears to be composed of skin from different species, including human. When not moving, SCP-63 will maintain this layer with its forelegs spread out wide, similar to a praying mantis. There appears to be no purpose to this action, as it remains this way even while resting. The layers are distinguishable by texture and color; the inner layers appear wrinkled and leathery, while the outer layers appear smoother and more flexible. The number of layers varies during different phases of life and growth; the number is highest during infancy and infancy/maturation, and lowest during adulthood and maturity/maturation. There appear to be multiple openings in the skin similar to pores which connect to small sacs that contain red organs that resemble muscle tissue. These are visible only through viewing directly underneath SCP-63's head. While human faces are visible through these pores during infancy, they will later close up most of their pores as they age.</p><p>SCP-63 does not communicate verbally or vocally; rather, the sounds it produces seem to be emitted from its body itself, similar to certain insects such as locusts or crickets. The sounds produced are low pitched and repetitive; typically ranging from 30 to 60 decibels depending on which vocal organ is producing it, but occasionally reaching up to 70 decibels or higher when excited or annoyed. After approximately 8 hours of being awake and fully fed, SCP-63 begins to move amongst the containment chamber and fan; typically performing a series of dances involving backbends and leg stretches with some idle roughhousing thrown in between those movements.</p><p>A short while after retiring for the night, SCP-63 will begin chirping at intervals roughly 15 seconds apart; generally consisting of repeating "noisy" syllables (details withheld by request). These noises do not contain any English language words or sounds - instead they are similar to those produced by humans who speak backwards (e.g., mouth movements that produce words), foreign languages such as Japanese or Chinese characters that have been reversed (simultaneous onomatopoeic mimics), or [REDACTED] ("toma de paja").</p><p>The onset of the reverse vocalization has been noted as "party time." Guide dogs trained at Foundation dog training facilities have demonstrated difficulty in distinguishing between their normal yelps, barks or howls from sleeping SCP-63's reverse mimicry while they sleep.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum SCP-63-01:</strong> SCP-63 has been dormant for the past two (2) years. During that time, it has not made any sounds or movements. As of 20██-06-06, it has begun to chirp at regular intervals again, starting from an age of 1 year and 4 months old. The sounds produced during this chirping period are similar to those produced by humans who speak backwards (i.e., words). To date, no sound has been recorded that has not been previously demonstrated.']</p>
