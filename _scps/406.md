<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-406</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-406 is a flying vehicle of unknown origin based at Site-77. It is to be provided with the latest in high-grade military technology and personnel, according to the current draft of the New World Order.</p><p>No contact with the outside world is to be maintained from within SCP-406's hangar. Access to that area is restricted to Level 4 personnel and above, who shall not engage in any social activity which would violate the standards established by Project CANDIDATE for MTF members.</p><p>Individuals are forbidden to make references on social media to instances of SCP-406, or their perceived significance. Mobile phones may be used only for recording experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-406 is a flying vehicle of unknown origin based at Site-77. SCP-406 appears to be modeled after the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, suggesting an airframe and nacelle design common to that technology. The device is ten meters long, has a wingspan of fifteen meters, and weighs approximately 30 metric tons. It has the ability to reverse its orientation within zero gravity by varying its position relative to the Earth's magnetic field. SCP-406 can also operate regardless of the density of inhabited Earth if it is transported from its location in space to one with less than one billion inhabitants.</p><p>SCP-406 is equipped with eight small, cylindrical devices attached to its corners, which are used as thrusters. These devices can propel SCP-406 through outer space for extended periods of time at high speed, although their efficiency degrades over time and energy consumption increases proportional to distance traveled. The devices show no signs of wear or maintenance; they first appeared on SCP-406's hull during Incident 406B-1.</p><p>Each tube corresponds to a different star system in the Milky Way Galaxy, except for hydrogen atoms and helium atoms. Though not required for flight, each device possesses an atomic number corresponding to a hydrogen or helium atom respectively. It has been suggested (but not proven) that the tubes themselves may be artificial constructs composed of antimatter material.</p><p>However, prior to Incident 406B-1 all eight starships were lost; at this point there are only two left intact:</p><p>The ship set out from Earth in 2116 CE and has since completed six flights across the galaxy; data gathered during each journey is typically sent back to Earth as soon as possible for study by researchers on the ground. Despite being unmanned, instances of SCP-406 are frequently cited as evidence by many writers with philosophical perspectives varying from Ayn Rand's Objectivism through ecofeminism and posthumanism.</p><p>Incident 406B-1 occurred on 28 November 2118 CE when security personnel detected an unusual amount of activity coming from within the spacecraft's hangar. Due to both its size and location in relation to existing facilities, this area was deemed suitable for emergency containment only. Personnel entered the hangar but were drowned out by a "high frequency beep" which lasted approximately twenty seconds; following this period security personnel regained control over their bodies and could exit the hangar safely due to the inaccessibility of the original source of noise..</p><p>Later investigations found several objects resembling naval mines on or around SCP-406's hull; these had all been previously deployed but failed to detonate due to lack of fuel or ammunition nearby at the time each was deployed (see log attached). Each such mine was successfully removed from SCP-406 by a remotely controlled craft piloted by D class personnel (see log attached). However all twelve craft were destroyed after two months' use due to battery depletion and lack of replacement parts; further testing is pending approval from O Command.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Following Incident 406B-1, SCP-406 was placed under the control of Dr. Christian Kaltman and his assistant, Dr. Frankel. The two were later removed from SCP-406 via a Type-III Field Projector; following this incident it was determined that Kaltman had been attempting to leave SCP-406 via an airlock with the aid of a magnetic crane and a small spacecraft he had constructed for the purpose. After being alerted by the sound of an approaching spacecraft, Kaltman discovered that Frankel was attempting to sabotage him. This resulted in his death and the destruction of the equipment by Frankel's spacecraft, which was subsequently destroyed by security personnel.</p><p>The incident was investigated thoroughly by Dr. Kaltman's team, and all involved were reprimanded as appropriate; however, as Dr. Kaltman's role in the incident was minor and he had not attempted to sabotage SCP-406 and was not involved in any classified experiments, no further disciplinary action is recommended at this time."]</p>
