<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-301</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-301 is contained in a secure standard humanoid containment cell. During Containment Breach Exercises, SCP-301 is to be accompanied by at least two (2) security personnel, who are to take orders from Site Command.</p><p>Each month, SCP-301 is to receive a weekly group of morning exercises (see File 301-Open for details). Any individual who wishes to speak with SCP-301 must not be a member of the Foundation itself, but must instead be an outside party that has been thoroughly screened by the Ethics Committee and cleared to visit the area.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-301 is an adult male humanoid entity measuring 1.9 meters tall and weighing 73kg. SCP-301 appears to have been a regular human being, with no anomalous properties, prior to its containment. SCP-301 is extremely agitated and agitated constantly despite the use of local sedative agents.</p><p>SCP-301 has a strong fondness for the Beatles; this is most notably observed in its frequent use of their songs while communicating with other entities.</p><p>When attempting to communicate with SCP-301, it will respond to questions with very specific and complex metaphors that frequently reference the works of the band itself. When asked about its origins and history, SCP-301 will often become hostile or withdrawn and refuse communication altogether. SCP-301's responses cannot be fully understood by humans, but can be selectively translated by individuals with knowledge of literature, pop culture and art.</p><p>Observations: SCP-301 speaks English fluently, but does not appear to be able to understand any other language aside from English. It is believed that SCP-301's level of cognitive ability is similar to an average college graduate.</p><p>When speaking to Foundation employees it has been noted that SCP-301 tends to speak in a higher tone than most humanoids would, using words such as "super" and "mega". Many employees in close proximity describe the sound of SCP-301's voice as having a somewhat robotic quality.</p><p>SCP-301 was captured during a local police raid at ████ ██ ██████ after a string of ATM robberies occurred in ██████████ and ████████ city. After capture, several Foundation operatives were covertly present during interrogation whereupon it was discovered that SCP-301 was responsible for the robberies. Following questioning, SCP-301 was brought into Foundation custody on charges of bank robbery and breach of containment following an incident in which it took control of several patrolling Foundation guards before passing out from exhaustion.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-301's record notes the following information:</p><p>As noted by Foundation operatives, SCP-301 has always been extremely protective of its home and had a tendency to behave aggressively in situations where it felt threatened or endangered. During its interrogation, SCP-301 claimed that it was an orphaned child who was raised by street musicians and vagrants, who taught it how to play the drums and guitar. It was also noted that SCP-301 had no memory of living anywhere else than in its current location prior to its capture.</p><p>SCP-301 has not spoken to any Foundation personnel since its arrival on site.</p>
