<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-53</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A room in a standard Foundation containment cell has been dedicated to SCP-53's containment. It is to be maintained at a temperature of 0-4 degrees Celsius, with a humidity of 10-50%. SCP-53 may be moved from the containment room to provide basic therapy and exercise programs.</p><p>A table, wheelchair and multi-purpose tool have been provided for any work necessary, such as repainting or cleaning. Feeding and watering, if needed, is to be handled by Site doctors through examination, notifying the Dr Antholeth before feeding takes place. As no other objects are need in the containment of SCP-53, this feeding may be repeated regularly as needed.</p><p>Any individuals wishing to visit SCP-53 must fill out the following form and submit it to the Dr Antholeth, who will review it with the site director before issuing clearance.</p><p>Visitors to SCP-53 must remain at least 6 meters away from SCP-53 at all times unless specifically allowed otherwise. No one with colds, coughs or other respiratory illnesses are allowed within 5 meters of SCP-53 without first being tested for any respiratory problems which could present a risk in case of an extreme respiratory system collapse or anaphylactic shock. Any individual exhibiting symptoms of paralysis will also be denied access to SCP-53. Anyone on SCP-53's list of approved visitors are allowed regular visits from the Site doctor and can expect daily treatment and educational events including lessons in the history of their adopted city, in addition to regular medical checkups and fitness exercises up to four times per week.</p><p>Although nothing is known about who they were prior to entry into their host body, those who join SCP-53's list of approved visitors may expect their mind and identity to undergo significant changes over the course of several months. After six months or more under these extreme conditions, these changes will usually stabilize.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-53 is an humanoid entity, thought to be deceased, that has been living inside the abandoned hospital at █████████████ for 14 years with no apparent means of sustenance. SCP-53 is estimated to be between 15 and 20 years of age, and has been discovered to have a list of around three hundred individuals who it would like to one day retain as its new body.</p><p>SCP-53 is clothed in tattered military fatigues, with no shoes. The soles of its feet are completely bald and are riddled with bruises and contusions. It appears to walk on its heels, completely unable to walk on its toes or flat feet. The skin on its face, chest, arms and lower torso have bubbled and peeled away, revealing muscles beneath the nameless flesh that has yet to heal. This area also appears to be penetrated by numerous objects (usually sticks or nails).</p><p>Examination of SCP-53's host body reveals it to be a female, who bears many scars and tattoos all over her body, including a large swastika on her forehead made out of knife wounds. It appears that the host body died while undergoing surgery where the swastika was drawn on her face. Many of these injuries underwent surgeries without anesthesia at some point during the host's lifetime. The name "Karen" was written under the swastika in permanent marker.</p><p>SCP-53 has few skills beyond walking, shown in how much difficulty it takes for SCP-53 to do offensive work such as shoving tableware about or even clean up spills. With much cooperation from Site staff members of all levels, SCP-53 has been able to learn to use a wheelchair for mobility purposes and can now feed itself and drink from water bottles for self-maintenance purposes. It can also be taught rudimentary sign language skills.</p><p>SCP-53 claims to be from New York City and has exhibited confusion by calling itself 'Jack'. SCP-53 claims that it had been working at this location since 1948 but when asked why it was needed here so long after the war ended in 1945, seems genuinely confused as to why this question would arise.</p><p>SCP-53 will typically stay in its room seated on a chair with its legs stretched out in front of them until nightfall ends and lights are turned on. At night time during winter months when temperatures fall below 0 degrees Celsius, SCP-53 will remain dormant and will only move into the other rooms when someone enters the building at nighttime. However, it will not leave the building unless invited by a visitor or several visitors simultaneously requesting its presence outside after they have seen each other accosted by cold weather conditions outside the facility (including freezing rain and snowstorms). Even then, SCP-53 has been observed refusing many attempts at departure due to some kind of malfunction in their biological systems which unconsciously prevent them from leaving their home until someone else leaves or dies as well. If a person dies whom SCP-53 has not approved as an accepted member of its list of approved visitors yet, SCP-53 will usually leave their host's corpse within 24 hours in order to move into another body without waiting for Winter's return.</p><p>When an individual is added onto SCP-53's list of approved visitors after being listed as 'unclaimed' for any period above six months consecutively, most visible changes are restricted solely within their mind rather than their physical appearance due to integration; however, everyone who has joined this list had changed significantly prior to becoming an accepted visitor. Due to unknown reasons, several former additions become more irritable with each passing month following being added onto SCP-53's list</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-53 was first reported as a missing person on 01/27/1948 in New York City by the [REDACTED] family and later reported as deceased.</p>
