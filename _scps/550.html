<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-550</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-550 can, on occasion, be heard at the site of Incident 550-1. The Foundation has constructed a digital mimicry system (DSM) at the location, designed to replicate and playback a sufficient number of harmless sounds in order to disguise the activation of SCP-550.</p><p>Due to the potential for an interruption in surveillance, the following is a list of acceptable responses and commands when SCP-550 is activated:</p><p>Acknowledgement is required for use of the standard operating procedure for each response. If proper acknowledgement has not been received after 1 minute and 30 seconds, the training officer will activate SCP-550 with only one command: "wait."</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-550 is a digital security system programmed to record and transmit sounds. The following activate SCP-550:</p><p>Upon the activation of SCP-550, the sound produced will be played back. If no acknowledgement is received within 2 minutes, additional commands will be given via DSMs in order to obtain acknowledgement from the household. No prompts will be heard on the outside of the house.</p><p>EXAMPLE</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Incident 550-1</p><p>On ██/██/████, Agent ████ (Retired) activated SCP-550 while residing at Site-44. A recording of Agent ████ was played back to Agent ████ via the digital mimicry system (DSM). Following the activation of the DSM, a recording of a male voice was played back to the bedroom window.</p><p>Agent ████ did not acknowledge the recording and remained in his room. The sound was repeated three times before Agent ████ emerged from his room and acknowledged its existence. The recording immediately ceased playing and SCP-550 deactivated.</p><p>The following is a transcript of the audio file played to Agent ████. During this incident, no instances of SCP-550 were observed or heard, despite their activation at a residence located within 20 meters of Site-44. Any instance of SCP-550 that activates is audible only when the target does not have proper audio equipment for receiving an outside noise.</p>
