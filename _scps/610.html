<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-610</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation agents have been operating the "Unclaimed Carver Bash" event since SCP-610's neutralization. O-Level Mobile Task Force Beta-66 ("Vanishing Crew") has been assigned to this operation. The purpose of the event is to advertise and publicize the existence of SCP-610, as well as its carver.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-610 is a red Chevrolet Impala functioning as an autonomous prototype of the Foundation's Mobile Task Force Rangemaster, designated T-66. The number "66" is painted on the front and rear fenders to indicate its role in the recovery of SCP-610, while the letter "R" is stenciled on the trunk lid to denote its association with Project Rangemaster.</p><p>SCP-610 possesses a complete set of autonomous auto-pilot functions (although it lacks an on/off switch for this purpose), and can perform many tasks autonomously. However, these capabilities have been disabled by the Foundation agents operating out of Site-73. Specifically, SCP-610 was designed to be operated by one or more human operators. It is not known whether such operators are still alive, or what other anomalous circumstances may have removed them from overseeing SCP-610's activities.</p><p>The personnel stops at which SCP-610 was recovered have been observed to have changed since its escape from Site-██. This suggests that it has altered its route at least once since leaving the containment facility in ████, as opposed to following its original path each time. This effect has often been slight, such as when the route was extended due to construction or repairs along the road; however, in one case the route was almost completely altered.</p><p>At 22:00 on ██/██/████, SCP-610 left Site-73 and began driving in a random direction across southern Canada. At 00:03 on ██/██/████, SCP-610 reached a gas station (Unidentified) in Alberton Junction, Ontario; at this station it consume 3 liters of ethanol fuel and shat a human fetus (believed to be fully grown male) onto the roof of the structure. The fetus "ran up" into a wing mirror mounted on SCP-610, which caused SCP-610 to halt in place for 10 minutes before proceeding with its original course of travel; at this point SCP-610 resumed moving within Canada after further investigation determined that there were no injuries sustained by either vehicle or crew members during this incident.</p><p>SCP-1106 was possibly deployed by way of another delivery vehicle at some previous point in time.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 610-A:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████, SCP-610 was observed to arrive at Site-73 and enter the facility. Following a short while, it emerged from the building with a small box in its hands and drove away from the site. No personnel personnel were present at the site at this time. At this point, SCP-610 continued driving northward along Highway ████ until it reached the exit for Highway ████ at ██████, Saskatchewan. It then proceeded eastward along this highway until it reached a gas station (Unidentified) in [[REDACTED]] (populated by Swiss and German nationals), where it consumed 15 liters of gasoline, shat 3 human fingers onto the roof of the structure, and produced an additional 4 human fingers from its mouth. The finger "died" shortly after entering the structure and was subsequently incinerated on the spot.</p><p>The finger that was consumed by SCP-610 was recovered and identified as that of [REDACTED] (29), a Swiss citizen who had reported missing in ██████, Switzerland on █/██/████. In addition, [REDACTED] was also carrying a box containing three packs of cigarettes, each containing 9 cigarettes. A partial set of fingerprints were found on one of the packs of cigarettes, which matched those of [REDACTED]</p>
