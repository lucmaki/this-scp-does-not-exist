<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-350</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A 100 m high fence, with a perimeter of 1.5 km, has been constructed around SCP-350. No animals may enter or leave the perimeter without Foundation approval. Each member of the public entering SCP-350 must be monitored by security personnel at all times. Any cattle deaths within SCP-350 are to be investigated as potential SCP-350 kills and classified as such.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-350 is a grassland biome in █████, ██████. It is completely devoid of any wildlife or vegetation, aside from vanilla plants and grasses. The area also appears to be entirely devoid of humans. However, the soil within SCP-350 is remarkably fertile and capable of supporting large populations of normal livestock.</p><p>Entering SCP-350 causes the affected subject to enter a coma lasting between 12 and 18 hours. Upon awakening, subjects report having awoken in an unknown location equidistant from their origin point and the current location (See Addendum 350-A). Subjects have reported that any vegetation present has been altered beyond recognition, but are otherwise unharmed and note no structural damage or trauma.</p><p>If a subject remains within SCP-350 for more than 24 hours, they will expire due to starvation or dehydration. No evidence has ever been found indicating how food or water enters SCP-350. Testing with nonhuman subjects is currently prohibited by Ethics Committee approval pending further study; testing with human test subjects is currently in progress (See Addendum 350-B)</p><p>SCP-350 was discovered after the Foundation captured and interrogated one of the six specimens involved in a livestock raiding attempt (See Addendum 350-C.)</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 350-A:</strong> Subjects have reported being unable to determine where they originated or their current location.']</p>
