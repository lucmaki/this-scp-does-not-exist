<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-920</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-920 is stored inside a standard Safe-class containment locker at Site ██. In the event of discovery, Foundation agents posing as jewelers are to make arrangements with local authorities to cover up any irregularities, such as the missing body of the victim. A cover story regarding scam artists preying on elderly or the gullible is to be fabricated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-920 resembles a single ticket for a popular marriage counseling group, the Couples' Counseling Institute. Its anomalous properties manifest when it is handled by an individual not currently married. Once conscious, affected individuals exhibit signs of being in shock, such as lowering their voices to a whisper, or struggling to talk, and begin to show signs of agitation.</p><p>Once all of these effects are detected, the affected individual will begin to frantically search for a phone or computer upon which to find a marriage license. They will attempt to make calls or research online for licenses, even if they are not actually married. This behavior continues until the individual comes across someone else who is not married, at which point they discontinue this behavior and revert back to baseline anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-920 was recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED] after a member of the staff noticed that the victim had been missing for approximately six hours. The victim's body was eventually discovered between two parked cars after his car broke down, and no other significant events have been recorded occurring since recovery. Upon autopsy, it was discovered that SCP-920 had eventually caused [DATA EXPUNGED], presumably resulting from the aforementioned actions taken by the victim.</p><p>Interview Log 920-01</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Dr. ████: What brought you here today?</p><p>Dennis ████████: Oh…yeah…um…</p><p>Dr. ████: Please go ahead and speak freely, we won't hold anything against you here.</p><p>Dennis ████████: I don't know what else to do uh…I mean…I can't find my wife anywhere…she's gotta be somewhere right? I just wanna see her again and tell her how much I love her…she's my heart and she makes me so happy!</p><p>Dr. ████: Now Mr. ████████… Is there anyone in your family that can act as your proxy? An older relative perhaps? A personal friend?</p><p>Dennis ████████: No no no…I don't have any family left but I guess there's my cousins but they're pretty young and stuff we only stay in touch when around holidays or stuff like that but I can't ask them…they invited us out this morning but we already promised our next date on Valentines day together so I'm kind of sad now…what about hubby guy? Gosh, he'd just die if he could see me like this!</p><p>Dr. ████: I'm sorry Mr. ████████ but there is nothing I can do for you here at this moment. You have been exhibiting signs of stress long enough; however you were very helpful during your session with Dr. Donohue earlier today before your disappearance so please consider joining our regular counseling sessions as soon as possible either by joining our online mailing list or creating a new account with an online therapist yourself using your credentials from our website today also give us a call afterwards if you want to talk more with one of our counselors about that day's experience if nothing else at least you know where services are available should you need them again later on in your life. Thank you for your time and please feel free to leave now.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-920 was transported to Site ██ after Dr. ████ had a change of heart. Doctor ████ has been assigned to the SCP's case."]</p>
