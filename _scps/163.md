<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-163</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-163 is currently held at the ██████ ████████ Site ██ (Kijevsky, Ukraine). SCP-163's location is currently unknown and still under heavy guard by Foundation agents. Despite this, SCP-163 has become much easier to track due to several instances of SCP-2960.</p><p>SCP-163 is to be fed daily via food and water that are specially controlled for it. Should SCP-163 attempt to escape, a non-anomalous dog having been drugged with two doses of ketamine and one of barbiturates are to be placed in its cage to prevent physical contact. Failure to give proper care will result in SCP-163 attempting to treat itself via self-harm.</p><p>Interview Log 163</p><p>Interviewed: SCP-163</p><p>Interviewer: Doctor ███████</p><p>Dr. ███████: Hello again, SCP-163. We have a few more questions for you.</p><p>SCP-163: Alright then. What do you want? I'm kind of feeling uncomfortable right now</p><p>Dr. ███████: Oh don't worry about that, we know you can't understand us; we just want to know when you plan on escaping again.</p><p>SCP-163: Escape? Didn't they just tell me that I was getting better? And where do you get off thinking I'd actually want to escape? I haven't felt this content in years! Why would I want to leave this place?</p><p>Dr. ███████: (sighs) Well, even if you aren't capable of understanding what we're saying, we could at least give you some comfort with this information. It's not very pleasant but I think it deserves your attention. It's about your retirement home.</p><p>SCP-163: Retirement home? What are you talking about?</p><p>Dr. ███████: The facility you were being held at had been found abandoned and all of the staff were missing or presumed dead. After an investigation was conducted during which the living quarters were cleared out, the foundation was contacted by an agent working for the owners of a company called [REDACTED]'s Homes. They believe that you are unable to live on your own due to your mental age and that they'd like permission to retrieve your body so they can start modifying it again once it is safe enough for someone else to live in it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-163 is a small, gray dog that is estimated to be roughly around 1.5 meters in length and weighs 27 kilograms. SCP-163's name and fur color are currently unknown. SCP-163 appears to have the ability to mimic the actions of other animals by way of physical contact, but cannot speak or control the masquerade itself. SCP-163 is unable to use its masquerade on animals less than 30 kilograms in weight unless these animals are larger than 28 cm.</p><p>SCP-163's primary anomalous effect is one where it has been permanently ageless despite being 100% physically fit as well as having lived for over ███ years with no signs of aging. The only means for SCP-163 to age is by physical damage done to its body. As such, any pathologic conditions, infections, or broken bones will result in death from old age without fail if not treated. Due to this, SCP-163 can never fully leave its retirement home unless it is given proper medical treatment and care that is specially controlled for it.</p><p>Due to being ageless, SCP-163 does not require rest or sleep during this period, even while asleep. However, SCP-163 does need proper nutrition and water every day. Failure to give these will result in the respective condition gradually killing off its body until it dies due to old age.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 163-A:</strong> SCP-163's body has been modified to accommodate its needs while being ageless."]</p>
