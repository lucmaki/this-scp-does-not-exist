<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-833</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-833 is to be contained in a standard containment facility with a room dedicated solely to its containment. This area should be kept as free of direct sunlight and as dark as possible while still allowing for normal activity. Personnel entering and exiting SCP-833 are to wear full body suits and protective goggles if the chemical in question is corrosive or non-toxic. Full coveralls and respirators are to be worn if the chemical in question is hazardous or toxic.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-833 is a boombox. It has been observed to play several songs, each of which are played over and over again without any set order. When not playing music, SCP-833 appears to be in a dormant state with no anomalous effect.</p><p>Music will only play if:</p><p>If the scenario above is not met with success, SCP-833 will play its first song of the day as normal. On two separate occasions, SCP-833 played the same songs back-to-back with an additional album playing in between.</p><p>Only one song has ever affected subjects differently: "The Power", by Master P and Craig Mack (album titled "Ghetto Story"). The song is particularly unnerving because it is usually played very slowly. However, when the song was played at a high pitch and volume, subjects have reported feeling a sensation similar to dizziness and nausea. This dose was below lethal levels so no serious injuries have been reported from this event.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On 08/12/2001, an interview was conducted with Dr. L█████.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. L█████</p><p><strong>Interviewer\'s Notes:</strong> Interview took place at Site-██ in a soundproof room designed to keep outside noise out. Subject exhibited no outward signs of discomfort during the interview.</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> So, how do you feel after listening to "The Power" for the first time?</p><p><strong>SCP-833:</strong> I feel… powerful.</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> Powerful? Why?</p><p><strong>SCP-833:</strong> Ha ha! Yeah, no, not really powerful. It\'s just… it\'s just awesome!</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> "Awesome"…</p><p><strong>SCP-833:</strong> Yeah! It\'s got so much energy behind it! It\'s so exciting!</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> "Exciting"… Exciting?</p><p><strong>SCP-833:</strong> Totally awesome, man! Listen to it: "I\'m about to take over this whole world!" It\'s incredible!</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> And what do you think about the lyrics? You know the song is about Master P and Craig Mack, right?</p><p><strong>SCP-833:</strong> Whoops… yeah, yeah I know that. It\'s just… it\'s just awesome!</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> "Awesome"…</p><p><strong>SCP-833:</strong> Awesome? Yeah, I guess so… oh wait, that doesn\'t sound right… but it still sounds awesome!</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> Listen, if you want to continue this interview, I need you to be more specific. What did you feel when you listened to "The Power"?</p><p><strong>SCP-833:</strong> I felt so happy! Like I could conquer the world! But then I felt really sick… like the way you feel after eating too much junk food or something… and then suddenly I felt great again! It\'s just an amazing song!</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> "Amazing song"? That\'s all you have to say? You mean you can\'t even explain what does it make you feel? How about this, then? Say "I love that song". Would that help?</p><p><strong>SCP-833:</strong> You know what? You\'re right, man! I love that song! Love it! Definitely love it! Definitely love it!!!</p><p><strong>Dr. L█████:</strong> Well, that\'s good then, isn\'t it? Thank you again for your time.</p>
