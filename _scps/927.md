<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-927</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-927 is currently housed in a standard containment locker. The following objects are to be kept within 5 meters of SCP-927's center of mass at all times:</p><p>Sample 927-12 "Frozen".</p><p>Sample 927-13 "Red Label".</p><p>Sample 927-14 "Smooth Black".</p><p>The surface area is to be covered with black cloth, extending a foot from each edge. Any marks off these dimensions are to be photographed and catalogued.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-927 is a bottle of Body Brand Black, a brand of black ink. This bottle has no anomalous properties as far as experimentation has shown, and does not appear to physically change when out of a liquid environment.</p><p>SCP-927 changes the color of any liquid it's in to Black. Liquid can be any type of liquid, including blood, milk, water, or semen. The object that the liquid is from will be unchanged by this process; however, those who drink from SCP-927 will become affected by SCP-927's properties. Blood will turn a deep slate blue, semen will turn brownish, milk will turn pale cream, and water will become an off-white color.</p><p>By drinking from SCP-927, the subject's body tone will change accordingly to one of the colors. The 'original' color of the subject's body tone will return if they do not consume any more SCP-927 after being affected by it. The body tone color is permanent; there are no known ways to reverse this effect.</p><p>Eating meat or certain other foods may alter their color slightly; however, this effect is insignificant compared with the effect of drinking SCP-927, and further testing is unnecessary.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Testing Log 927-1</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-2912</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject consumes 20 ml of SCP-927.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject\'s body tone turns a deep slate blue.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject expresses desire to be referred to as "The Black".</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-5379</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject drinks 40 ml of SCP-927.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject complains that the color is too dark, and begs for more light. Subject\'s body tone remains blue.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject begins referring to "Black" as "my precious".</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-6899</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject drinks 75 ml of SCP-927.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject\'s body tone changes from blue to a deep slate black, except for the area around their face and the tip of their nose. In addition, the subject continuously cries out in pain, and bites their wrists repeatedly throughout the testing period. Subject is given sedatives, and administered painkillers.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Eventually, after two weeks of sedatives and painkillers, subject begins to recover from the effects of SCP-927, but still shows no reaction to it until they are removed from its range. After being removed from SCP-927\'s range, subject\'s body tone returns to normal.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-2334</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject drinks 200 ml of SCP-927.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject\'s body tone turns into a deep slate black. Subject expresses discomfort with the color and requests to be returned to normal colors. When asked if they want to stop consuming SCP-927, subject states that they will continue until the test is complete "or [they] stop breathing!". Unresponsive at this time.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Unknown how long D-2334 was in range of SCP-927 after being removed from its range; however, subject eventually died of an unspecified heart attack.']</p>
