<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-270</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-270 is to be contained within a standard containment cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-270 is a Scottish oak tree located in the █████ campus of the University of Glasgow.</p><p>The SCP has a diameter of 20 m and produces one to two fruits annually. SCP-270 removes the wood from these fruits and creates wooden "protest signs", which are hung down its outer limbs. These signs look similar to other protest signs made by spontaneous human combustion victims but have been described to be «spiky». The second use of their wood, they take the form of a more identifiable object like a limb or a head. Intentionally broken a piece of SCP-270's wood will grow back into its original shape within 10 days.</p><p>It is suggested, but not confirmed, that SCP-670 is connected to SCP-270 and may exhibit similar behavior at some point in the future, but additional testing on this matter is prohibited under the current circumstances.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Since January 2015 SCP-270 has produced one or two signs every year.</p><p>The first sign was a wooden sign that read "Climate Change" on the top and "Save the Planet" on the bottom. On the left side of the sign is an image of a human skull with climate change written above it. The image changed to a new one every year. When asked by the Foundation personnel, SCP-270 refuses to reveal its creator(s). To date, only two people have been confirmed to produce these signs. The first was a female [REDACTED], who used her own hands to create the sign. The second was █████ ████, who used a chainsaw to create the sign and a chainsaw to cut down SCP-270\'s wood. The chainsaw was brought back with him when he [REDACTED].</p><p>On January 2, 2015, SCP-270 produced another protest sign, in which a hand with a red "X" symbol appeared on the palm. The following day at 12:00, SCP-270 began to produce signs in which the entire limb of its body was replaced by what resembles a wooden mallet. On February 2, 2015, SCP-270 produced another sign, in which a wooden sign reading "Stop Global Warming!" was hung down. On February 4, 2015 at 11:00, SCP-270 began to produce signs in which its entire body is replaced by what resembles a prison door with bars. All other signs produced since then were made using its original method of using its wood.']</p>
