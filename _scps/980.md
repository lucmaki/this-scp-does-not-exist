<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-980</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-980 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, furnished with a bed, bathroom facilities, and an electronic video game console. SCP-980 is to be fed two (2) meals a day, consisting of at least two (2) hundred and fifty (250) grams of meat or fish, together with twice as much fruit and an additional one hundred grams of rice. SCP-980 is not allowed to consume any other food items. Drinks are allowed to SCP-980 only when it goes on a hunger strike.</p><p>All personnel involved in testing SCP-980 must wear full body protective equipment, including respiratory masks equipped with filtration systems, gloves made out of thick rubberized fabrics, and boots, which are lined with steel plating. Any personnel involved in testing SCP-980 should be aware that SCP-980 can inflict severe physical harm upon any individuals who have not been properly protected, and should follow all safety precautions at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-980 is a Caucasian male, approximately two (2) meters tall, weighing 110 kilograms. SCP-980's head is large and misshapen, slightly sloping backwards, with a common shape of most individuals of its race. SCP-980 appears to have a strange deformity in its left eye, which has been described as "very deep", "very dark", or "completely black". The same dark spot can be seen on the right side of SCP-980's face. The deformity of SCP-980's left eye is invisible with the naked eye, but appears to be a small area of bruise on the inside surface of SCP-980's eye.</p><p>When subjects are exposed to high levels of radiation, SCP-980 will approach them and attempt to communicate with them in an unknown tongue. When asked about its purpose for doing so, SCP-980 has responded that it wishes to gain knowledge from humans. However, all attempts by SCP-980 to communicate with humans have failed. Documentation from initial testing indicates that approximately fifty percent of human subjects who encounter SCP-980 report being able to understand what it is saying. The other half were unable to understand anything said by SCP-980. It appears that people who are insensitive to radiation are unable to understand what SCP-980 says. Subjects who do not appear sensitive to radiation still find the language spoken by SCP-980 hard to comprehend, but they seem to understand more than those who are sensitive to radiation.</p><p>SCP-980 will only talk with subjects who have been exposed to high levels of radiation within three (3) hours of exposure. Further testing has indicated that subjects who have been exposed to low levels of radiation less than three (3) hours after exposure do not respond when spoken to by SCP-980. It appears that the longer a subject remains in contact with SCP-980 without being exposed to high levels of radiation, the more difficult it becomes for him or her to understand what it says.</p><p>In addition to talking with those who are exposed to high levels of radiation, SCP-980 will also make attempts at conversation with those who are not subjected to radiation at all. Though it becomes very difficult for humans not subjected to radiation to speak intelligibly to it at first, it does not seem intractable in this regard; researchers have noted that if one does not speak too quickly when trying to communicate with it, and makes an effort at speech that suggests intelligence and rationality on the part of the person speaking - despite the fact that most such attempts will fall on deaf ears - then it is possible for humans not subjected directly or indirectly to high levels of radiation (including D class personnel) to carry on a conversation with it over time without fail.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 980-01:</strong> On 18/10/2017, SCP-980 was fed three (3) slices of meat pie, as well as two apples and one banana. In the early morning, SCP-980 attempted to speak with all personnel in the room, but they could not understand what it said. Later that day, SCP-980 was exposed to a high level of radiation, after which it began speaking English.</p><p><strong>Addendum 980-02:</strong> On 08/11/2017, all researchers confined to the area where SCP-980 is kept were instructed to wear full body protective equipment.</p><p>After numerous failed attempts at communication, SCP-980 unexpectedly changed its behavior. It began approaching researchers that did not have protective gear on, and then proceeded to speak with them in English. Dr. ██████ and several other personnel questioned whether or not the change was a result of faulty memory from former tests, but it seems clear that SCP-980 is capable of learning new languages. Personnel who had been exposed to high levels of radiation were unable to understand what SCP-980 said, while those exposed to low levels of radiation were able to understand it perfectly fine. Personnel can be seen trying to listen to SCP-980 talk using earphones and listening devices, but they are shown to hear nothing.']</p>
