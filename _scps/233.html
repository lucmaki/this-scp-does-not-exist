<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-233</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-233 is to be kept in Site-79's containment wing and observed under 24x7 video surveillance. In the event of a containment breach, Mobile Task Force Gamma-7 ("Firehouse") is to use standard O Containment procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-233 is a decommissioned mobile phone tower located in [REDACTED]. SCP-233 was dismantled and transported to Site-79, where it is kept in a standard containment chamber with thick steel doors. The interior of the chamber has been heavily modified in order to house SCP-233 and its contents.</p><p>In the basement of SCP-233's containment chamber is the remains of the Foundation's old motor pool. The motor pool was originally used to prevent the use of SCP-233 as a hidden escape route, but since this area was not regularly checked, it was used as a secondary containment unit for SCP-233. It appears that the construction of the containment chamber was based on a modified blueprint of our own Site ██'s motor pool, which dates back to at least ████.</p><p>Within the motor pool are various anomalous objects which cannot be described due to their value being over ███. They are labeled as SCP-███ (1), SCP-███ (2), and so forth. Each instance of an SCP inside SCP-233 is believed to have been removed from our facilities and brought into Earth orbit shortly before their disappearance. These are all listed below.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> As the Foundation was unable to recover SCP-233, it is currently under the control of the Mobile Task Force Gamma-7 ("Firehouse").</p><p>-Dr. ██████</p>
