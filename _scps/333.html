<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-333</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-333 is to be kept in a standard cell of a Type 2 Secure Containment Unit at Site 51. SCP-333 is to be fed once every 24 hours and shall require no other treatment. In the event of an emergency, SCP-333 is allowed limited access to one personnel for up to 10 minutes at a time, with no more than one additional personnel present. At the end of this time, SCP-333 is to receive no further outside contact until an additional five (5) minutes have passed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-333 is an adult male indetectable humanoid entity of an unknown biological classification. SCP-333's physical description and appearance appear to be related to SCP-███, a human entity thought to have been created as a result of the SCP-███ Experiment. SCP-333 has not volunteered any information regarding its origin or nature, and has not shown demonstrated any knowledge of its anomalous properties.</p><p>SCP-333 describes itself as "a science experiment" which was mistakenly installed into its current containment cell. It identifies itself by these circumstances only; it will use first and last names when speaking with personnel, but does not respond to questions about the nature of its origin.</p><p>When under direct observation via CCTV for one half hour per week, SCP-333 will exhibit one of three states:</p><p>Foundation personnel who interact with SCP-333 report similar effects, although this effect is much weaker than when directly observing SCP-333. Each additional Foundation personnel present during observation can reduce the strength of this effect.</p><p>SCP-333's main motivation appears to revolve around learning more about its anomalous properties. It will often engage in "what do you know?" conversations with Foundation personnel; questions that produce positive reactions include "why don't we know more about it?", "is there a way to tell it apart from other anomalies?", and "is there a way to make it talk?". These topics are also frequently discussed with non-Foundation personnel, who generally have little success in answering these questions. When confronted with these topics during conversation with Foundation personnel, SCP-333 will openly express disappointment at its lack of knowledge, claiming that it "hates secrets".</p><p>The researcher writing the log entry must attempt to answer the questions posed by SCP-333 in order to avoid further negative effects on his/her mental state. Failure to do so will result in increased levels of isolation until a successful log entry is written down.</p>
<p> ['Addendum</p><p>On 09/08/20██, SCP-333 was given permission to be granted one hour of outside contact per week. During the first half hour, SCP-333 appeared to mimic its prior behavior, but after the initial exchange, SCP-333 began expressing frustration at not being able to answer the questions asked in the logbook. It expressed a desire to "talk to someone about it". Further attempts to engage SCP-333 in conversation were unsuccessful, and SCP-333 was returned to its current cell.']</p>
