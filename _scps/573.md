<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-573</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> One-A</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-573 is to be kept in a sealed, pressurized storage unit at Storage Containment Locker Four (SCP-573). The interior wall of the containment chamber is to have a security camera installed and the chamber may only be accessed by approved personnel with level 4 clearance. A water tank containing liquid nitrogen is to be kept within SCP-573 for temperature control.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-573 is a small, spherical room measuring 12 meters in diameter and 6 meters in height (approximately 933 sq ft). The interior of SCP-573 has a temperature of -200°C.</p><p>The air within SCP-573 is devoid of all Earthly matter, except for a few types of oxygen, fluorine, hydrogen and nitrogen molecules that have not yet been observed in the atmosphere of any planet or moon. This plasma may be caused by a process similar to that which causes solar flares. The plasma is visible as a green-tinged plasma, but this coloration has no effect on the plasma itself.</p><p>Granting passes from Dr. Valerius (level 4 clearance) to other Foundation personnel is permitted on an individual basis for testing purposes only. Any attempt by unauthorized personnel to enter or exit SCP-573 will result in immediate termination, aside from research and testing personnel.</p><p>Any human or animal with eyes capable of detecting light between approximately 400nm and 780nm will be able to enter and exit SCP-573 without issue; however, such organisms are also incapable of observing the plasma within SCP-573 when inside and cannot breathe. This causes severe damage to the organism's lungs until they either suffocate or burn their eyes out. When exiting, non-exposed animals are cured of burning eyes upon exiting the chamber and will regain normal vision following exposure to natural sunlight. Non-human organisms exposed to SCP-573 become permanently blind if their eyes are burned during exposure to the body plasma. Resin growths have been observed on eyes after prolonged exposure among some of these organisms.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 573-A:</strong> On 05/12/2012, Dr. Valerius entered SCP-573 and entered the chamber after a number of test subjects were killed by sustained exposure to the plasma in the chamber. After one hour, he was able to exit the chamber and immediately went to the hospital for treatment for his burns. He was returned to confinement after five days of treatment, during which time he demonstrated no signs of mental or physical impairment. After his release from confinement, he was promoted to level 4 clearance and is permitted full access to SCP-573 once per month.']</p>
