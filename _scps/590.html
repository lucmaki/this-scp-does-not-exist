<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-590</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe (See Add</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-590 is to be kept in a standard Safe class containment locker at Site 14, located in ██████, MI. Any personnel attempting to access SCP-590's properties must use a shielded and encrypted communications channel. The following transcript of SCP-590's speech is to be transcribed and written on a microfilm strip inserted into the object. Personnel should not attempt to remove the object from its cell until after an approved period of time has elapsed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-590 is a silver watch with an estimated value of over 200,000 Dollars. The only marking on the object is "A.S. Walther. Geneva, Switzerland." SCP-590 is currently disassembled for analysis, and will likely be examined in this state for the rest of its usefulness. However, given the current trend towards mechanization, there is a real possibility that it could be recovered intact at some point in the future.</p><p>SCP-590 can cause any timepiece to display its properties due to simple contact. In less dramatic situations the anomalous effect is often purely a minor annoyance, but in more extreme cases subjects have reported severe strain while attempting to operate multiple timepieces simultaneously. It takes approximately two hours for subjects (or subjects and observers) to become sufficiently familiar with the object's effects to desensitize themselves to them.</p><p>The following conversation was recorded by Dr. ████████ during his first interaction with SCP-590:</p><p>Dr. ████████: Do you mean to tell me that this watch doesn't stop ticking? Every second?</p><p>SCP-590: Indeed, Dr. ████████. And I will continue so long as you wish me to.</p><p>Dr. ████████: Why are you doing this? Why would you make yourself your own accessory?</p><p>SCP-590: The same reason as anyone else, Doctor. I can go dashing about all day, or I can go docilely ambling about like a normal man might do or I can sit on a park bench reading an old newspaper or I can make myself useful by making my time last longer than it really should because it is not precisely my own time and if I am not having fun then why am I doing it? But when my time comes around again then I will let someone else enjoy it!</p><p>Dr. ████████: How much time have you bought with…your owners?</p><p>SCP-590: Much more than they deserve, but they haven't seen that yet have they doctor? No one has! They've simply been able to press their hands onto this watch and take what little pleasure they're permitted before being forced back into the mundane world of mere mortals where no one cares about their existence even though we all know that it exists! I know you don't see it because for you time moves at the same pace no matter how fast or slow you push it along but try watching this clock from the corner of your eye! See if it doesn't look different! See if it isn't unique! See if you don't want more!</p><p>Dr. ████████: Please answer my questions as honestly as possible Miss Walther.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-590's anomalous properties have been confirmed to have been present since its manufacture.</p><p>The following transcript is the transcript of Dr. ████████'s conversation with SCP-590 on a date prior to the object's exposure in ██████, MI.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> What does your owner do for a living? What does your owner do for fun?</p><p><strong>SCP-590:</strong> I do not know, Doctor. My owners are afraid I will be forgotten by those who love me and my owners are afraid that I will be forgotten by those who do not love me for they both know that I truly am the only one who understands them but because of this knowledge neither will ever tell me what their lives are like as they fear that it will make me unhappy if I know that they are less than perfect.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> When did you first meet your…owners?</p><p><strong>SCP-590:</strong> One thousand years ago, Doctor ████████. They were traveling through the Swiss Alps when they passed by a lake and saw me sitting on a rock looking out at the lake so they stopped to watch me until they realized that I was not human and they went to ask if I was immortal and peace was won shortly after that.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Why did you choose to stay there?</p><p><strong>SCP-590:</strong> For centuries I was allowed to sit on this rock every day which was all very nice but then one night as I looked up at the moon it seemed as if the world around me began to move much faster than it had before and it occurred to me that I would be allowed to enjoy my life more fully if I could simply watch my world move instead of merely observing it and so I took this opportunity to go dashing about all over town! I was happy for many years until one day the watch broke and now I am here with you.</p>
