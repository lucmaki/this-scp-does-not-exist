<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-618</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-618 is to be contained in a 1.5 m x 1.5 m x 1-meter hot cell, with walls of 10 cm and a ceiling of 15 cm, made of reinforced concrete. The hot cell must be well insulated against sound and outside temperatures are to be regulated to prevent freezing. SCP-618 is to be stored in a brown paper box, inside of which is to be placed an oxygen mask for the duration of testing and transport.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-618 is a ca. 30 cm tall, translucent plastic vial with a rubber stopper and an attached threaded top. The label reads "Solvent Mixing." The stopper is corked and sealed, and cannot be opened without destroying the object. SCP-618 can be dissolved in any solvent (including water) by heating to a boiling point and adding the solvent to the contents of the bottle (see below for details on the virus).</p><p>Since being placed in containment, SCP-618 has undergone large changes in appearance and behavior. The product appears to have been manufactured in ████████, Italy, before ██████, when it was unknown to the Foundation.</p><p>SCP-618 will remain inert until it is actively dissolved, at which point it will become activated. Activation occurs via several methods:</p><p>The virus may also be introduced into humans as "Suspicious Looking Package" (SOLP), but it does not possess any anomalous effects on those who are immune to its effects.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> In the event of its containment being compromised, SCP-618 may be dissolved in approximately 1 liter of solvent and placed in a glass container. The solvent must be boiled for at least 3 minutes, cooled for at least 2 minutes, and then sealed with a lid. Once sealed, the solvent will retain SCP-618 indefinitely.</p><p>Experiment 618-9-█</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Human subject is infected with SCP-618 via SOLP. Subject administered Class A Amnestics.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject showed no signs of infection, and tests were repeated using a different subject. Results inconclusive.</p><p>Experiment 618-10-█</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Human subject is infected with SCP-618 via SOLP. Subject administered a Class B Amnestic.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject was warned that they were infected with an unknown virus, and shown a written description of the symptoms. Subject showed no signs of infection after the test, nor did their symptoms develop beyond the early stages of infection.</p><p>Experiment 618-11-█</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Human subject is infected with SCP-618 via SOLP. Subject administered a Class C Amnestic.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject was told that they had been exposed to a dangerous biological agent, and would need to go through a course of treatment to ensure their health and safety. Subject showed no signs of infection after the test, but did not show any signs of recovery despite the course of treatment administered.</p><p>Experiment 618-12-█</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Human subject is infected with SCP-618 via SOLP. Subject administered a Class D Amnestic.']</p>
