<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-428</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-428 is to be stored in a secure airtight container. Access to SCP-428 requires the approval of two (2) individuals with Level 4 security clearance or higher. The approval of one (1) member of the Department of Paranormal Research and Defense is also required, so that they may be alerted if SCP-428 begins to move on its own.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-428 is a set of twenty (20) uncut diamonds, each weighing approximately .5 carats. SCP-428 was uncovered in the vault of an abandoned shop in Frankfurt, Germany. Despite the lack of visible damage (as well as a lack of other jewelry or precious stones), a thorough investigation has indicated that SCP-428 was placed there over a month before its discovery by an unknown person.</p><p>When tested, SCP-428 will move autonomously through freely accessible spaces within a building, avoiding obstacles and actively pursuing entities bearing human shape. If such an entity is approached within thirty (30) meters, SCP-428 will suddenly exert pressure on the chest area matching the density of the target's clothing. The target will then become extremely weak, slowing down until they stop altogether. The target will then begin to emit high pitched noises audible only to themselves and SCP-428, similar to those made by humans suffering from severe cardiac arrest. After approximately one (1) hour, the target will attempt to extract their own heart from their body with any possible aids at hand (the most common being non-standard tools such as dental retractors or nail files). The target may also attempt to remove their own brain from their head via burn wounds on their scalp. Eventually, the target will expire from exhaustion due to these injuries - though the psychological trauma caused by this event is not curable by medical intervention.</p><p>All instances of SCP-428 possess the following identifying marks:</p><p>Foundation attempts to locate and neutralize sources of SCP-428 prior to its transportation.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 428-1:</strong> SCP-428's activity was first recorded on ██/██/19██ when an individual matching the description of an unidentified deceased subject was found in the possession of a large quantity of uncut diamonds (believed to be SCP-428). The corpse was found lying in a stairwell near the ████████ University in ██████, ██████. Autopsy revealed that the subject had been alive at least one week prior to the discovery of their body. The subject was missing a significant portion of his heart, although no signs of trauma were observed on their body.</p><p>It is believed that Foundation agents were able to recover SCP-428 from the dead subject's corpse due to the lack of blood evidence.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Despite the fact that the subject was still alive at the time of death, SCP-428 has not attempted to move on its own since this incident."]</p>
