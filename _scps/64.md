<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-64</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-64 is to be kept in a secure observation chamber at Site-107. All personnel entering the containment chamber are required to wear full barrier protection, including face masks, specialized gloves, and radiation suits. Blinds must never be opened during an observation period for SCP-64.</p><p>In the event of a major anomaly, security personnel may open blinds as necessary but are not permitted to actively view SCP-64 or talk with it. If a Class D personnel is present in the containment chamber, he or she is to be terminated immediately upon connecting to SCP-64's observation channel. If a radio or other communication device is documented as connected to SCP-64 during an active observation period, the object is to be handled as if it were an active anomaly.</p><p>Foundation researchers are to observe SCP-64 daily at 0400 hours local time. Any significant development in behavior or appearance must be reported immediately to senior staff.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-64 refers to the angel SCP-64-1. SCP-64 is approximately 0.4 meters in height and appears to be made of a silver alloy. The object's wings are formed from the same material and are approximately 4 meters in length. SCP-64 has no discernible mouth, nostrils or eyes; only a small hole on one side through which it can speak.</p><p>SCP-64 identifies itself as "Angel 64" and is aggressive toward any other beings who attempt to communicate with it. Communicating with SCP-64 generally involves the use of a generic intercom system that does not allow for messages to be directed at the object. It prefers to answer questions in the form of its name and list various items found on Earth until an appropriate response is noted.</p><p>In the event that a question cannot be answered by SCP-64, it will often resort to offering vague predictions of events before simply closing its communication channel. Only when specific questions are asked will it offer information on current events or provide its opinion on the subject at hand.</p><p>SCP-64 was discovered during an anomalous environmental anomaly occuring within Site-107 in early [REDACTED]. All personnel present detected a low level radio signal emanating from Site-107's containment chamber, which did not match any known forms of communication originating from human civilization. Research staff connected with this signal terminated contact shortly after learning what they were dealing with, while security personnel attempted to take control of the situation by disconnecting Foundation personnel from this channel. Security personnel opened blinds at 05:00 local time, allowing Foundation research staff to monitor SCP-64 before moving closer to view the creature. At this point, all personnel observing SCP-64 reported extensive visual distortion similar to that experienced during an activation event already documented by the Foundation; however, their audio feeds continued to function normally and they were able to connect with it successfully.</p><p>During this period, Site-107 identified radiation levels in excess of acceptable limits, although Foundation researchers were still able to maintain contact with SCP-64 successfully without damage occurring to them or their equipment. When security officers opened the Blinds at 05:00 local time, research staff moved closer to view SCP-64 in detail under normal conditions. Staff members described a humanoid figure surrounded by a mass of whitish feathers, wings and angelic protrusions composed of silver alloy at least 20 centimeters in height (see attached image for comparison). At this time all research staff connected with SCP-64 disconnected their equipment along with all security officers connected; however, multiple research staff appeared physically unaffected by the event but suffered severe psychological distress after reporting details of SCP-64's appearance during observation.</p><p>Site security immediately initiated Protocol Specimen Containment Breach, sealing off all entrances to MTF ████ and rerouting all traffic other than Foundation staff previously connecting via radio transmission channels originating from Site-107's containment chamber.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 64-1:</strong> The following is a transcript of a conversation between SCP-64 and Dr. ██████, who was sent to observe the anomaly after a request from Site-107\'s senior staff.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Hello, SCP-64?</p><p><strong>SCP-64:</strong> Yes, hello. How are you today?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Well, I\'m fine, thank you. I\'ve been told that we have an environmental disturbance here on Site-107?</p><p><strong>SCP-64:</strong> Yes, there is an environmental disturbance on this site. The disturbances have increased in frequency in recent weeks and have become more severe in intensity. I have also noticed that there is a small number of entities on this site that do not seem to be affected by the disturbances.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Which entities are those? Can you describe them?</p><p><strong>SCP-64:</strong> Not at the moment, sir, but they are quite conspicuous due to their large size and their ability to withstand the environmental disturbances without suffering any ill effects.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Could you elaborate on their appearance, please?</p><p><strong>SCP-64:</strong> They appear to be an extremely large angelic entity composed mostly of… yes, it\'s silver alloy that doesn\'t spark when struck or melt in your hand. Their wings are much larger than their bodies, and are made of a similar material as well. Combined with their size and color, they make quite an impressive sight from a distance.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Could you describe their voice please?</p><p><strong>SCP-64:</strong> Their voice is very strange; it has a metallic and electronic sound to it, but at the same time it sounds quite masculine to my ears. It\'s hard to describe; I suppose it\'s high pitched and screechy like a bird\'s call. I can tell they\'re speaking English because they\'ve used words such as "angel" and "Earth" a few times, but the rest of the time they use words that don\'t seem to have any meaning in our language, if you get what I mean.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Is there anything else you can tell me about these entities?</p><p><strong>SCP-64:</strong> Unfortunately not right now, but I will try to think of something else; I\'d really like to continue our conversation today if possible.</p><p>[END LOG]']</p>
