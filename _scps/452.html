<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-452</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-452 is to be contained in a stainless steel lockbox, supplied with enough materials to construct three additional locks. The container is to be stored in a security-locked room in the Astrophysics Department of Site-77, and only the senior research staff of Site-77 are allowed entrance to it. SCP-452 may only be studied by personnel with Level 3 or higher clearance for SCP objects.</p><p>No experimentation with the object outside of approved testing procedures is permitted under any circumstances. Violation of this instruction will result in termination of all Foundation personnel involved in the violation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-452 is a stainless steel lockbox, with a large padlock (which meets Foundation specifications for Type II) and two keys. The two keys are identical in color, texture, and weight to the key for regular household use.</p><p>Any person who attempts to open the container using the key assigned to 'normal' household usage will be unable to disengage it from the lock. The reason for this anomaly is unknown; every attempt thus far has failed after up to 6 minutes of effort.</p><p>An individual attempting to open SCP-452 with a key assigned to 'heirloom' usage will have no difficulty unlocking the lock. The mechanism remains unchanged between these two types of keys, and attempts to remove the token by those other than who originally designed it have remained unsuccessful.</p><p>SCP-452 was recovered by agent ████ ████ on █/█/1999 at an auction in ██████████, Germany. The agent had come across SCP-452 while investigating reports of villagers physically attacking those selling items at local auctions. After discovering that several persons had been killed as a result of 'heirloom' key attacks, experimentation was initiated to determine the cause.</p><p>Document 451-1: Test Log</p><p>Testing has shown that SCP-452 can only be opened by one specific type of key, assigned to "heirloom" usage. No other keys will work on it. Subject ████ is instructed to attempt opening SCP-452 with an ordinary housekey he has been given (a replacement should be produced after experimentation is completed), which cannot be opened or removed from SCP-452. The results of this test are recorded below. Additional tests involving SCP-452 and alternate means of opening can be found on file 451-1.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
