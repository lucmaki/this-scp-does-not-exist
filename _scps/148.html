<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-148</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-148 are to be handled in a manner akin to other human subjects afflicted by traumatic brain injury. Subjects should be monitored closely until they have recovered enough to resume ordinary living.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-148 are humanoid creatures (resembling a muscular human male of average height) covered in a sturdy layer of greenish-brown armour. Armor covers the upper parts of their bodies, leaving their hands and faces exposed. Arms are covered in large articulated segmented plates which are roughly shaped like small hands. SCP-148's limbs are also covered in large flat plates resembling knee caps, with one plate extending from each knee joint. The ends of these plates resemble spring steel tendons, with a set of sharp spikes extending outward.</p><p>SCP-148 display no signs of left/right symmetry, often matching a slight asymmetry to their design. The armor covering their limbs is replaced every Autumn by new armoured plates, and they can remove and replace arms at will. Instances of SCP-148 measure 2 meters in height and 70 kilograms in weight, and appear to have very limited flight capabilities.</p><p>Instances of SCP-148 are extremely aggressive towards humans, attempting to impale and grapple them with the metallic claws on their hands. As soon as possible following any major injury SCP-148 will begin making forays outside their habitat, attempting to attack passing vehicles or members of passing human groups. SCP-148 will continue to follow humans until they've received debilitating injuries requiring non-emergency medical care or until they've died.</p><p>SCP-148 normally land on top of vehicles travelling through areas where instances have been previously located and attempt to rip through the vehicle's roof while at the same time gripping on with all five fingers and forcing their arm spikes into the roofing material. After this initial stage the subject will attempt to burrow its claws into the roof below the driver's cabin where it can then drag the vehicle to a stop through tearing open the curtains and tarp protecting the driver's cabin area.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 148-01:</strong> Recovery Log</p><p>SCP-148 was first sighted in ██████, Michigan on 28/05/2003. Several police officers had been dispatched to a gas station after reports of a man attacking people with a glove. A dark green pickup truck with a mounted machine gun was found at the scene and several officers took cover behind the vehicle while it was destroyed. Melted fragments of the truck's roof and cab were found scattered across the parking lot. The driver, later identified as SCP-148-1, was located near the gas station and approximately 2 minutes following the vehicle's destruction he took cover behind the nearby building.</p><p>The police officers, who were not equipped with flak jackets, were quickly engulfed by SCP-148-1's claws and dragged from their position. SCP-148-1 then proceeded to tear apart the police officers' car, dragging it around in circles before throwing it through a nearby window.</p><p>SCP-148-1 was then neutralized by gunfire from the police officers' personal weapons, and a team of Mobile Task Force agents arrived shortly afterward. The majority of the Mobile Task Force personnel then proceeded to fire at SCP-148 for approximately 10 minutes before all but one agent was struck by SCP-148's claws and dragged away. The lone member continued to fire at it until he was incapacitated by its claws ripping through his flak jacket.</p><p>The lone surviving agent was then extracted by helicopter and brought to Site-██ where he was held in custody until recovery. He has since been reclassified as an instance of SCP-148, designated SCP-148-2."]</p>
