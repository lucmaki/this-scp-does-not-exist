<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-148</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Instances of SCP-148 are to be handled in a manner akin to other human subjects afflicted by traumatic brain injury. Subjects should be monitored closely until they have recovered enough to resume ordinary living.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-148 are humanoid creatures (resembling a muscular human male of average height) covered in a sturdy layer of greenish-brown armour. Armor covers the upper parts of their bodies, leaving their hands and faces exposed. Arms are covered in large articulated segmented plates which are roughly shaped like small hands. SCP-148's limbs are also covered in large flat plates resembling knee caps, with one plate extending from each knee joint. The ends of these plates resemble spring steel tendons, with a set of sharp spikes extending outward.</p><p>SCP-148 display no signs of left/right symmetry, often matching a slight asymmetry to their design. The armor covering their limbs is replaced every Autumn by new armoured plates, and they can remove and replace arms at will. Instances of SCP-148 measure 2 meters in height and 70 kilograms in weight, and appear to have very limited flight capabilities.</p><p>Instances of SCP-148 are extremely aggressive towards humans, attempting to impale and grapple them with the metallic claws on their hands. As soon as possible following any major injury SCP-148 will begin making forays outside their habitat, attempting to attack passing vehicles or members of passing human groups. SCP-148 will continue to follow humans until they've received debilitating injuries requiring non-emergency medical care or until they've died.</p><p>SCP-148 normally land on top of vehicles travelling through areas where instances have been previously located and attempt to rip through the vehicle's roof while at the same time gripping on with all five fingers and forcing their arm spikes into the roofing material. After this initial stage the subject will attempt to burrow its claws into the roof below the driver's cabin where it can then drag the vehicle to a stop through tearing open the curtains and tarp protecting the driver's cabin area.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
