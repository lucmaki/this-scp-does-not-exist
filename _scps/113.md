<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-113</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-113 is to be held in a storage locker at Site-77, and is to be accompanied by a single notepad. This notepad must be replaced upon expiration of the notepad used for containment of SCP-113.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-113 is an American (designated American-113) style baseball cap, embossed with the words "Do You Want Heroes?" atop a pair of black wings. The stitching on its front reads "Painted For Life", and the back bears the number 113.</p><p>The wearer of SCP-113 will invariably say or do things that would impress ordinary civilians. These feats are extremely difficult to replicate, and often result in injury to the subject. The user of SCP-113 will display highly unusual behavior during their feats.</p><p>When SCP-113 is damaged, the effect of the hat will cease until SCP-113 is repaired. SCP-113 was initially thought to be damaged in Incident 113-Alpha, but was later discovered to be created as a construct out of thin air.</p><p>Incident 113-Beta: On 3/9/201█, an employee at Site-77's Containment Wing wore SCP-113 while repairing it. This resulted in him being taken into custody by agents working for Foundation Humanoid Containment Authority while under the effect of SCP-113.</p><p>As part of a cover story, this individual was presented as "RAND," a notorious member of organized crime who had been amnesticized by the authorities following his capture. SCP-113 residue was removed from his skin, and he was returned to containment with no memory of what had happened during his time in containment.</p><p>On 7/8/201█, after the majority of the GOC had been neutralized following Operation BEDLAM, a sighting was made of an escaped criminal from 1970 named "GORDON CLAYTON," who was wanted for multiple federal crimes including murder and kidnapping. After searching through files on file from 1970, Foundation agents discovered that "GORDON CLAYTON" was actually Dr. John Clef - one survivor of Incident 113-Alpha - and that he was still alive and armed with an unspecified firearm (SCP-113).</p><p>Dr. Clef subsequently led Foundation forces to another member of GOI Rhine incursion team Entitlement (a child psychologist), who revealed that she had been using SCP-113 as a power source for her mobile phone while on assignment to assist survivors affected by their exposure to SCP-█████. Dr. Clef used Entitlement as bait to lure other members of GOI Rhine into Site ████ with intentions of killing them all with Entitlement's weapon; however, due to his current proximity to other members of GOI Rhine he attempted to set up an ambush instead.</p><p>After Dr. Clef fired several shots against Foundation forces in expectation of his fellow GOI Rhine members emerging from concealment, Agent ████████ stepped out from behind cover and shot Dr. Clef three times in the chest before shooting him three more times in the head; this resulted in his death after suffering 11 bullet wounds.</p><p>Agent ████████'s actions were officially recorded as self defense; despite all witnesses having described Dr. Clef as behaving in a manner consistent with SCP-113's effect on non-anomalous individuals, Agent ████████'s actions were never reported as such.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 113-1:</strong> On 9/30/201█, Site-77 received a message from the Foundation's central database. The message contained a message from Dr. Clef which read as follows:</p><p>Do you want heroes?</p><p>Do you want to be inspired?</p><p>Do you want to know your purpose?</p><p>Do you want to be great?</p><p>Take the answers.</p><p>The hat is there for you.</p><p>You are the hero of your own story.</p><p>Heroes are made for stories.</p><p>The hat is waiting for you.</p><p>I hope you're a good writer."]</p>
