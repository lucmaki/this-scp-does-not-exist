<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-783</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-783 is to be kept in a sealed glass jar at Site 47. Testing of SCP-783 must first be approved by the Site Director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-783 is a clear, viscous syrup (approximately one fluid ounce per 1,000 kilograms of water) with the consistency of honey. SCP-783 possesses no unusual aroma or taste. As an in vitro test, it shows no adverse effects to cells or organisms when ingested orally.</p><p>When portions of SCP-783 are ingested by unsuspecting humans, subjects report a feeling of increased body strength and vitality upon taking SCP-783. While under the influence of SCP-783, subjects will experience changes in their personality, including greater aggression and a greater need for physical exercise and fresh air. Subjects shown to be able to withstand these effects will manifest a number of anomalous properties including increased strength and durability, the ability to see things in ultraviolet light (visible only by subjects under the influence of SCP-783), and the ability to perceive unheard sounds in their vicinity.</p><p>Changes made to a living subject's body after administration of SCP-783 have not been observed outside the living subject. It is unknown whether this is due to the process of SCP-783's creation or because its anomalous effect is limited to humans who ingest it.</p><p>SCP-783 was discovered in ██████, England when local authorities were called to a disturbance at the ██████ Hospital; reports state that ██████ residents had been experiencing many unexplained deaths over the previous several months. At least ██ victims were confirmed to have been poisoned by ingesting portions of SCP-783 with other food items. These victims had all used intravenous solutions with alcohol as preservatives; alcohol poisoning was likely the causative factor in these deaths rather than SCP-783 itself.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-783 was originally acquired by the Foundation following the death of Dr. ██████, who was investigating the effects of SCP-783 in ██████. The Foundation has been in possession of SCP-783 since this incident.']</p>
