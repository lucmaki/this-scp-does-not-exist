<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-363</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The London suburb of Marylebone is to be evacuated and the area surrounding SCP-363 has had three meters of concrete removed. The area between the gravel road and the road itself is to be fenced off and no civilians are allowed within the radius of 25 meters. Any civilian entering this zone is to be contained and removed from the area by Foundation personnel.</p><p>The living quarters of SCP-363 are to be monitored via closed circuit security camera systems inside and on top of the tank. All visitors to SCP-363 are to be accounted for, identification card scanned, and then escorted out of the premises for questioning.</p><p>Any civilians with knowledge about SCP-363 are to be kept at a minimum standard distance of 50 km away from SCP-363 until amnestic treatment can be carried out.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-363 is an oak tree located in the rear garden of ████████ Public Aquarium, London, England. The tree has grown at a rate of six meters per month since being planted in 1980.</p><p>Twice each week, usually on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 9:30 AM, four humans wearing animal disguises arrive to tend to certain aspects of SCP-363. These humans, hereafter referred as "Dr. ████████", "Dr. █████████", "Mr. █████████", and "Ms. ████████████" have all been reported to be capable of speaking English without any evidence of inflection or other accenting detectable.</p><p>The one aspect of SCP-363 that Dr. ████████ and Ms. ████████████ remove from the premises is the area inside the center trunk of SCP-363 — this is where an adult humanoid entity composed of oak bark lives for approximately one year before it is seemingly ejected from SCP-363 and vanishes into the atmosphere (see Incident 363-2).</p><p>Aftercare includes fertilization and watering, as well as routine pruning to ensure the entity's health and well-being. After the entity emerges from within the tree trunk, it will exit via a small hole in the ceiling above the courtyard containing SCP-363. It then travels approximately 35 meters away before appearing to vanish into thin air (See Incident 363-3).</p><p>In 1991, following two months worth of interviews with SCP-363 on how it ended up where it was (and what happened during Incident 363-3) as well as spending two months observing it myself while disguised only as a maintenance worker, I discovered that while attempting to reach The London Zoo back in 1979 (while working at The Bank Of England), SCP-363 somehow transported me by breech birth through a nearby wall into its backyard. Only 12 years old at the time, my mother later commented that she remembered making a connection between me and a human child who had died around the same time; this child was found dead naked in some woods near London Zoo… Coincidence?</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Interview 363-1</p><p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-363</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ██████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. ██████ interviewed SCP-363 for two hours on █/██/████ in order to determine if it had any other abilities.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>Dr. ██████ begins the interview by asking SCP-363 questions about its history and about the entity it contained in its trunk for a year. No response is received from SCP-363.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> We have been interviewing you for several hours now, but we still haven't gotten across everything that we need to know about your life and your existence… What else can you tell us? If there's anything you want to add or if there's anything you'd like to clarify, please let me know.</p><p>SCP-363 stands motionless for approximately thirty minutes before beginning a conversation with Dr. ██████.</p><p><strong>SCP-363:</strong> I'm sorry, but I can't talk to you right now… I've been told that I'm not allowed to talk to anyone at this moment. Is that okay?</p><p>Dr. ██████ asks SCP-363 if it wants to continue the interview and it remains silent for another thirty minutes. The interview ends when SCP-363 dissolves into a pile of ash and the ashes disappear from the area within the next fifteen minutes without a trace of where they went or what happened to them.</p><p><End Log></p><p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> The entity was seen several times on top of SCP-363 after this interview and a table and chairs appeared inside the tree's interior. The entity became more sociable over time and was reported to be spending most of its free time inside the trunk reading various books. As of █/██/████, SCP-363 has been deemed stable and has been given permission for contact with any personnel."]</p>
