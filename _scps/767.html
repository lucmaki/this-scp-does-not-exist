<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-767</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-767 is located in a secure containment chamber at Site-██. Personnel entering the chamber must be screened and cleared by the onsite fire department before they enter the chamber.</p><p>Only one room must be occupied at any given time. At this time, SCP-767 has been inactive for several months due to lack of funding, and all personnel are to refrain from entering the room until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-767 is an industrial garbage disposal unit. SCP-767 was originally ██████ Corporation, and is now ███████. The unit appears to have been inactive for approximately 150 years, as well as being exposed to non-human skin contact.</p><p>SCP-767 is described as a coffin of sorts, with a large metal compartment on the bottom. In this compartment is a piece of sulfuric acid weighing roughly 1 kg, which exhibits zero anomalous properties when tested.</p><p>SCP-767's anomalous effects manifest when a labeled plastic bag filled with extraneous matter is placed upon the unit's plate. When this happens, what appears to be [DATA EXPUNGED]. The sound of SCP-767's motor can be heard at all times, and experiments on the speed at which it operates have shown that SCP-767 moves at 60 km/h in any direction.</p><p>SCP-767's effect always takes place somewhere within 100 km of its physical location when activated. However, if no one is in a room and SCP-767 activates, it will proceed to move towards the nearest human inhabitant, regardless of the distance to them (this has not been observed in instances where SCP-767 activates through non-custodial means). Since the containment chamber has been equipped with motion sensors, and no humans are currently present in it, no further anomaly has been observed from this method of activation.</p><p>The only known way to prevent SCP-768 from appearing is for mortals to not be present in the vicinity of SCP-768 when it activates.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 767-01:</strong> Audio Log - Incident 767-1</p><p><BEGIN LOG></p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> What are you looking for?</p><p>SCP-768 appears to be searching for something.</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> What is it?</p><p>SCP-768 appears to produce a sound similar to '???'</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> What's that?</p><p>SCP-768 appears to make a sound similar to 'Crap.'</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> Okay, that's not as helpful as it could be. What do you want?</p><p>SCP-768 appears to produce a sound akin to 'Scoff,' and produces an image of a trash bag. D-███ looks over the image, before looking back at SCP-768.</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> Are you trying to tell me something?</p><p>SCP-768 appears to make a sound similar to 'Tch.'</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> Okay, are you trying to tell me something?</p><p>SCP-768 appears to make a sound similar to 'Hmm.'</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> Can you explain it a little bit clearer? You know, for my benefit.</p><p>SCP-768 appears to produce a sound similar to 'Curse this thing.'</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> So, where's your trash bin?</p><p>SCP-768 appears to make a sound similar to 'Hm, I'm not sure. It isn't in the apartment.'</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> So, where is it?</p><p>SCP-768 appears to make a sound similar to 'I don't know, it really isn't in the apartment.'</p><p><strong>D-███:</strong> But I need your trash bin! Is that important?! I need it! I need it so much!</p><p>SCP-768 appears to produce a sound similar to 'Kill him.' The image of a knife can be seen in the corner of SCP-768's viewfinder. D-███ looks at the image with shock. SCP-768 looks back, and smiles. D-███'s expression remains unchanged. SCP-768 makes no further movements. D-███ is still staring into the camera. After several minutes, D-███ turns off the camera, and sighs heavily, turning towards the wall. The recording ends here.</p>
