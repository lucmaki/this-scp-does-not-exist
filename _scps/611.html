<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-611</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-611 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-██. The subject's diet is to be restricted to non-prescription fruit only, with a daily intake of one banana, one apple, and one orange. SCP-611 is to be examined at least weekly by on-site physicians, who shall note any changes or irregularities in organs or physical condition.</p><p>Standard humanoid exercise is allowed, but no contact should be made with SCP-611 while it is being physically examined.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-611 is a humanoid of roughly 9 ft, 6 in tall. Its skin is an indeterminate, pale white color, with occasional patches of red hair. SCP-611's skin displays no abnormalities that would impede its use as clothing or body paint. One anomalous feature of SCP-611's skin is the fact that it absorbs certain radio and microwave energy quite well, subjecting the skin to extreme heat but little harm.</p><p>SCP-611 has been designated as Safe due to the fact that no harm has ever been caused to either SCP-611 or any objects contained within its reach. SCP-611 has demonstrated a behavioral pattern of ceaselessly seeking out and consuming large amounts of food (typically consisting of dairy products, meat and fresh produce), often leaving the site it has resided in for several days at a time before returning with new provisions.</p><p>Studies have revealed the following information about SCP-611:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Interview 611-01:</p><p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. ████████</p><p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-611</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Please state your name for the official record.</p><p><strong>SCP-611:</strong> Oh, uh… my name is Bob, but everybody calls me Bobby.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> And what is your occupation?</p><p><strong>SCP-611:</strong> I am a banana farmer.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Thank you, Bobby. Would you like to make a statement?</p><p><strong>SCP-611:</strong> Yeah, sure! Well, I'm here because I really need to get rid of this back.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Do you mean your back, or… your hair?</p><p><strong>SCP-611:</strong> My back! 'Cause that back's really bothering me. It's real stiff and itchy, and it feels like spiders are crawling on it all the time, and it's real bad when I sit down or lay down at night. I just wanna get rid of it!</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Why do you want to get rid of it?</p><p><strong>SCP-611:</strong> I don't know! I don't know what's wrong with it! It just seems like a big pain in the arse to me, and I want to get rid of it.</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> Very well, Bobby. We'll transfer you to Site-██ for its removal. You don't have to talk about this anymore if you don't want to.</p><p><strong>SCP-611:</strong> Really? You're not gonna make me feel bad about wanting to get rid of it? You're not gonna make me feel terrible?</p><p><strong>Dr. ████████:</strong> No, Bobby. We want you to be happy here at Site-██, so we'll make sure nothing bad happens to you during your stay at the facility. We'll even help with your hair removal if you want us to. How does that sound?</p><p><strong>SCP-611:</strong> Okay, yeah! Help with my hair removal sounds like a lot of fun! Thank you so much! I really appreciate this! You guys are awesome! Thank you, thank you… thank you! Thank you so much! (pause) Okay… um… I gotta pee now. Bye!</p>
