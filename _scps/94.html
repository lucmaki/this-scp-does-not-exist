<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-94</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-94 is to be held in a standard containment locker, and is to be inspected twice per day by no fewer than two staff members. If a wheel of the object's nature changes its color, a level 3 security breach protocol is to be enacted.</p><p>The object itself should not be disturbed while the tank containing it is filled with water. Testing on SCP-94 should only be carried out by at least two Level 2 researchers and one Level 3 researcher. Personnel encountering SCP-94 while it is in motion require immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-94 appears to be an ordinary bicycle, except the wheels have acquired properties previously unknown. When a rider uses SCP-94, the wheels will spin indefinitely. The object's anomalous behavior ceases when it is completely submerged under water in a tank or fenced off area. Testing has shown that if SCP-94 is not soaked in water, its anomalous properties will resume if the object is brought back indoors.</p><p>SCP-94 was recovered from [REDACTED] on ██/██/19██. The object was brought in by local police officers who were investigating the disappearance of six children from [REDACTED]. A Foundation agent posing as a news reporter dispatched to the scene of the disappearances was able to recover SCP-94 and prevent its destruction by police officers.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-94 was transported to Site-██ after the recovery of 11 additional children from [REDACTED], and it's currently being kept in a containment locker on site."]</p>
