<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-171</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-171 is to be kept within a locked storage room. Personnel are to keep their distance when interacting with the object, and are not allowed to touch it. No research involving the possession of SCP-171 may be conducted until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-171 is a wood and metal rocket, approximately two meters tall. The object is powered by an unknown source, and displays no evidence of reactor heat or resulting radiation. All attempts to determine the source have been unsuccessful. SCP-171 will continue to function regardless of external conditions. The object also exhibits several other unusual properties.</p><p>When placed in a vacuum (less than 10,000m), the object's propulsion system will operate at maximum efficiency for 100 hours before requiring another refill of air. The object will not stop unless its propulsion system is torn down and refilled from Earth. This "recharge time" can be extended if material is interjected in between refills. Refilling is currently only possible once every year from within Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>SCP-171 will always land on Earth (the object does not share any traits with commonly classified aerobots). In some instances, during high wind/tornado conditions, the object was able to successfully land on Mars or Venus.</p><p>Upon landing, the object will disappear within an average period of 5 minutes, leaving behind no visible traces or remains. No video footage exists of SCP-171 while it is operational outside a vacuum environment, except in one case where an image of SCP-171 was obtained by reflecting moonlight back off [DATA EXPUNGED]. Personnel are not to refer to this image as "video".</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 171-A:</strong> Current Research</p><p>Currently, SCP-171 is the object of study for several Foundation departments.</p><p><strong>Department of Engineering:</strong> SCP-171\'s propulsion system has been reverse engineered. The object will now only operate in a vacuum environment, rather than 100 hours per recharge. This allows personnel to conduct tests on the object while it is still capable of flight, and is expected to improve the quality of results. SCP-171 is currently being used as a testbed for various forms of propulsion.</p><p><strong>Department of Psychology:</strong> Due to its behavior pattern, SCP-171 has been studied extensively by Foundation researchers. The object has exhibited no notable emotional responses, and is not considered dangerous unless it is encountered outside a vacuum environment.</p><p><strong>Department of Occult:</strong> A special portrait of SCP-171 exists in the Department\'s containment facility; this portrait is not to be referred to as "video".</p><p><strong>Department of Sociology:</strong> The object acts as a sort of social network for those who live and work on Earth. Due to this, there have been numerous proposals made to construct an airtight dome in which all scientific personnel may work without fear of contamination from Earth\'s atmosphere. This proposal has been rejected due to concern over whether such a dome would be acceptable to the Foundation\'s human resources department.']</p>
