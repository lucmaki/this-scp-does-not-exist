<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-552</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-552 is to be kept within a standard containment locker at Site-28. No study of the object is permitted, including recorded images. Personnel are to contact the senior researcher in charge of the SCP-552 project for the purpose of requesting any new subjects of study.</p><p>SCP-552 should be cleaned once every year with a non-metallic detergent. All visible damage caused to the object by this cleaning should be repaired as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-552 is a wooden staff composed of a series of carved plants. The object measures 5 inches in length with a thickness of 7/8ths inch and an overall weight of 21.2 g. SCP-552 was found among the effects of a deceased individual, along with several articles of evidence identifying him as the owner of the object.</p><p>SCP-552 produces an effect similar to that of ayurveda (an ancient Indian medicine system) when held by any person with at least 1 prior day of exposure to the object.</p><p>When SCP-552 is held by a person, they begin experiencing feelings contrary to those felt when exposed to other objects, up to and including positive feelings towards the object itself and negative feelings towards anyone who attempts to remove SCP-552 from them. These emotions are reported to be both intense and long lasting, similar in feeling to that experienced when first exposed to SCP-552.</p><p>When SCP-552 has been held by someone for at least three days, their eyes lose color and hue rapidly until they have begun yellowing. After this process has begun, it will continue until no change can be detected in the subject's eye color after an additional seven days. Staining caused by iris dilation will not be permanent; however, tissue damage will continue without warning.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-552 was recovered from the home of a deceased individual in ████████, New York. The cause of death was listed as "unknown," and a search for other family members in the area had only found one cousin who had also died, ████ ██████. The body was discovered as a result of an anonymous call to the police by an assistant at the morgue. The identity of the caller has not been identified.</p><p>A search of the subject\'s home found several articles of clothing belonging to a person matching the description of ██████ ██████. The articles were heavily damaged and covered in dried blood and tissue. The majority of these articles had been destroyed, with a small section of clothing remaining intact. A set of these remains was recovered by Foundation personnel, and were kept in Site-28\'s restricted storage facility.</p><p>The remaining section of clothing was sent to the Foundation\'s research department for testing. It was later discovered that SCP-552 produces an effect similar to that of ayurveda (an ancient Indian medicine system) when held by any person with at least one prior day of exposure to it. This discovery led to the discovery of SCP-552 itself, which prompted the creation of this document.']</p>
