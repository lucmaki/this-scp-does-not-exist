<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-76</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-76 is to be kept in a Standard Safe at Site-77 under the guise of an Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. Upon becoming active, SCP-76's exterior should be coated completely with an anti-freeze/water solution.</p><p>In the event that SCP-76 begins to disappear or change form without provocation, security personnel may enter the room designated by SCP-76 and retrieve it if it is not visible. In the event the containment area is inaccessible via the portal, security personnel are to use a designated "scrying" portal in Site-77 and retrieve SCP-76 from its location. Any personnel who come into contact with SCP-76 during this transition are to immediately report to their superiors.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-76 is a battery-operated handheld portal device. SCP-76's appearance varies with the subject using it; however, it always takes on the appearance of Captain My Captain (a cartoon altered slightly to avoid copyright infringement).</p><p>SCP-76 functions similarly to other handheld portals, but can do little else. It is only able to transport objects and entities from the "real" world into SCP-76's interior. SCP-76 does not appear to be able to move or teleport freely within its container; instead, SCP-76 requires external power in order to operate.</p><p>SCP-76 is connected to a power source inside Site-77 via a charging cord disconnected from any mains, and as long as this cord is connected, it will continue to function normally. In addition, if SCP-76 is removed from this power source for more than 30 minutes (approximately 30 seconds when powered), it will immediately lose all function and disintegrate completely until the next time it is moved away from its power source. SCP-76 will often emit an audible warning when approaching this state. When removed from its power source, the signal necessary for SCP-76 to connect back cannot be detected by any means available by Foundation physics research.</p><p>When placed on the ground and connected to its power source, SCP-76 exhibits anomalous behavior including:</p><p>SCP-76 also has limited photographic capabilities, allowing security personnel to view an image of whoever was last in contact with it in its previous containment area. The person depicted in photographs taken with SCP-76 are listed below:</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-76 was discovered on ██/██/████, when a portable portal device belonging to an employee at Aperture Science was found in the possession of a homeless man in front of Site-77. SCP-76 did not activate until security personnel began to inspect it.</p><p>SCP-76's anomalous properties were only discovered when personnel began attempting to remove it from the power source. As of ██/██/████, SCP-76 has been securely contained in Site-77."]</p>
