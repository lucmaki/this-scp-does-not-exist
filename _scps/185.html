<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-185</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A research site has been established for the study of SCP-185. All bee colonies from any geographic location confirmed to contain SCP-185 are to be removed from their habitats, taken prisoner and relocated to the containment area. No further information regarding the phenomenon is currently available.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-185 is an anomalous property of certain colonies of bees, Dacchini, which have been observed to "contain" objects and animate them. If a colony containing the anomaly is removed from its native habitat, no new instances are created in the same location.</p><p>The object will take on the form of whatever may be in the colony at the time of removal. Known examples include:</p><p>The properties of objects animated by SCP-185 vary greatly, with many behaving violently or destructively. Instances appear to be fully aware of their own properties, and some carnivorous instances have even been observed to consume their own containers.</p><p>Once removed from its native habitat, most SCP-185 instances lose all sentience and fail to respond to normal stimuli. A few instances survive, however, and become aggressive toward any person or animal they encounter after acclimation. SCP-185 has not been able to adapt to captivity yet; consequently, all SCP-185 instances are kept in large bee boxes at Site-45 for further research.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong></p><p>SCP-185 was discovered in █████, ████ after a group of Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate reports of unusual activity. Upon arrival, they found themselves surrounded by aggressive instances of SCP-185, causing the Agents to retreat to their vehicle. The vehicle had been destroyed moments before arrival; however, the Agents were able to escape with non-anomalous Dacchini bees intact.</p><p>Upon investigation of the colony, it was discovered that all instances contained an attached note. The original note is as follows:</p><p>Please, something must be done to stop this thing! They are killing us slowly and surely. If you cannot get rid of them, at least help us escape their wrath! We don't want to die!</p>
