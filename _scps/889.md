<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-889</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-889 is currently contained within a flat, cylindrical steel container with a window on one side. The container is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment locker at Site-19.</p><p>Should any of SCP-889's anomalous effects manifest, the chamber is to be immediately evacuated, and site security personnel are to force entrance into the container and remove it. In the event of an escape, the facility housing SCP-889 is to be secured and all exits barred until the anomaly can be contained again.</p><p>The entrance beneath SCP-889's containment chamber is to be sealed off, and an airlock constructed over the opening which will prevent accidental or emergency access. All access should be primarily restricted by personnel with clearance level 2 or higher.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-889 is a 30cm tall, upright figure made of various white and off-white plastics. The "head" and "body" are composed of two individual halves connected by a joint in the midsection, while the arms are a flexible, translucent plastic at the shoulder, articulated at elbow and wrist. The appendages are fitted with black rubber gloves and boots with a leather tip.</p><p>Round shapes placed on the top inner surface of each "glove" intermittently light up red, blue and green. The interior of the gloves are thought to contain an internal battery or robotic motors which power the light show; the lights are not affected by temperature or other environmental factors. Due to the quality of the image projected on the inside surface of the gloves, it is impossible to determine exactly what images (beyond simple shapes) appear when lit up.</p><p>Under no provocation will SCP-889 approach humans indiscriminately, even if they have been treated with amnestics and pose no threat to it. It appears to have some kind of instinctive aversion to certain human races (primarily human), though this effect has only been observed with test subjects who personally met SCP-889's creator. Experimental testing has shown that SCP-889 will move away from all Foundation personnel who pose as SCP-889-1 instances whenever possible.</p><p> SCP-889 will only approach humans who resemble its creator, a Caucasian male in his late twenties named ████ ████████. It has been determined that SCP-889's effects only affect humans who resemble its creator; as such, any test subject who is not Caucasian will likely be unaffected by SCP-889's effects.</p><p>The only known way to deactivate SCP-888's anomalous effects is for someone resembling its creator to interact with it. Testing has shown that no one else can interact with it at any time without consistent activation of its anomalous effects; however, as long as an operator can reach into the containment chamber without activating it, it will not activate its effects regardless of how close they are to reaching into it..</p><p>Any interaction between human beings and SCP-889 causes changes in perceived physical properties of its material components. These properties remain consistent throughout any subsequent interactions with any individual who interacts with the object:</p><p>Test Subject: Research Assistant ██████ M█████</p><p>Interaction Result: When Research Assistant ██████ M█████ interacted with SCP-889 for 10 seconds (holding onto his hand), his skin felt like plasticine for approximately 1 hour afterwards; he did not report any significant pains or discomforts during this period.</p><p>Test Subject: D-7508 ("Pete")</p><p>Interaction Result: D-7508 was struck in the forehead by a bowling ball during an experiment with SCP objects; he reported feeling two sensations at once - one of being hit in the head by a bowling ball, one of being massaged in some sort of plasticine substance by only his right hand - for hours after cessation of activity with SCP objects had occurred. He pushed through these sensations until he was able to make his way out of their effects later on.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> After initial containment, SCP-889 was able to escape containment through unsecured doorways and corridors at Site-19. At present, it is not understood how it is able to open doors or move through them, though the possibility remains that it can use its gloves to manipulate the interlocking mechanisms of such doors.</p><p>Investigation into SCP-889's creation, history and creator are ongoing. Requests for information regarding SCP-889 should be made through O-█ approval."]</p>
