<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-156</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-156 is contained within a special cage in Site 99's feline containment cell, which has been modified to resemble a regular cat cage. Each night, SCP-156 is fed a diet of raw meat and blood as well as a bottle of water. Any blood removed from SCP-156 must be tested for impurities before being administered to the subject.</p><p>As SCP-156 appears to be naturally active at all times, it requires no special care or attention.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-156 was originally a female Chinese crested cat, named 'Lilith'. SCP-156 had the typical anatomy and appearance of a normal animal aside from its appearance and the black substance which has been shown to be a mixture of crude oil and charcoal. SCP-156 is capable of speech, but only in the form of grunts and growls. SCP-156 can understand human speech, but will often find these sounds annoying or incomprehensible.</p><p>SCP-156 has displayed an unusually high level of intelligence and cunning. On 3/7/1994, at approximately 8:30 PM, SCP-156 escaped its containment chamber. In the following days, reports of a "vampire" (a person who eats blood) were reported by civilians in the town in which SCP-156 lived, with eyewitnesses describing how "[s]omebody [has] been stalking girls and killing them". When interviewed by personnel from Site 99, SCP-156 claimed this to be true despite no evidence or proof being produced that could support this claim.</p><p>In fact, all incidents documented during the escape were determined to have been faked by SCP-156 in order to test its ability to imitate other people as well as what it called its 'miracle powers'. During a second attempt at escape on 3/11/1994, SCP-156 was re-contained.</p><p>On 3/12/1994, SCP-156 was found badly injured and bleeding from multiple open wounds in the upstairs bedroom of a local family after accidentally falling down the stairs while evading capture by Foundation agents attempting to recapture it. Suffering from third degree burns covering 90% of its body, SCP-156 was taken into custody by Foundation agents and treated for its injuries before being transferred to Site 99's feline containment cell.</p><p>SCP-156 claims that "No vampire would go near it [after its escape attempts], they wouldn't dare try to be like me".</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 156-1:</strong> SCP-156\'s escape attempts have been analyzed by personnel from the Foundation in order to understand its motives. Due to the lack of any definitive evidence regarding SCP-156\'s miraculous abilities, it is currently unknown whether SCP-156 is capable of teleportation, levitation, transformation into a bat, etc.</p><p>SCP-156 describes its "miracle powers" as "the ability to make things happen without being able to explain how I can do it". SCP-156 further claims that "[t]he reason I\'ve never been caught before is because [it has] the power to always know how to get out of the place I\'m inâ€¦I just don\'t know how I do it".</p><p>SCP-156\'s escape attempts were completely unrelated to each other; they were not planned ahead of time and had different weaknesses. However, all three failed because of a single error made by SCP-156.']</p>
