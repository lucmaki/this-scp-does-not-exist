<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-986</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The computer of SCP-986 is to be placed in a standard Safe-Class digital media locker. A manual backup of the contents of SCP-986 is to be made once every three months.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-986 is the name of a standard, portable external hard drive. It belongs to Mrs. ████████████, age 43 when last tested. The device was discovered in her bedroom, unplugged and with its power cord removed.</p><p>The contents of SCP-986 are an encrypted file that cannot be opened directly. Attempts to open it will result in an error message stating “This file is not supported by the system”, which is consistent with a Windows-based operating system. A computer virus known as “Sonic Worm” is believed to have hijacked the device and is preventing access to the file, but this has been proven false.</p><p>SCP-986 was found to contain the following files:</p><p>SCP-986 was discovered during a routine data analysis of [REDACTED]. During this assessment, it was determined that SCP-986 had been plugged into a network port on the central server of [REDACTED], where it was used to backup all data files from that system; however, no backups had been made since the device was installed. Investigation by Foundation agents revealed that a technician for ████████ Security Systems had sold SCP-986 to ████████████ on 4/13/████, without his knowledge or consent. The technician has been placed in psychological therapy before being reassigned.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum SCP-986-A:</strong> SCP-986 was found connected to a laptop in the living room of ████████████’s residence. The files within SCP-986 can be accessed directly and are not encrypted. The contents of these files are not accessible with the exception of:</p><p>SCP-986-a further reveals that what appears to be a binary virus (in reality a Trojan Horse) was hidden within SCP-986, which has since been removed.</p>
