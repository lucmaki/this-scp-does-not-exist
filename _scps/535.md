<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-535</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As of ██/██/████ all SCP-535 instances are to be monitored via CCTV in Site-03. When the number of instances has reached 200, activation of missile interceptors is to be initiated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-535 is a collection of 200 to 300 crystalline structures, the approximate size, mass and form of 1-meter cubes. The structures are able to move by opposing gravity, maintaining an angular velocity of 6 meters per second at all times.</p><p>SCP-535 instances act as both structural and structural support for SCP-635, an extradimensional entity contained within. Unlike SCP-635, SCP-535 remains inert unless instances are within 3 meters of it. An active instance makes no attempt to interact with others or influence events outside its immediate vicinity unless directed to do so.</p><p>SCP-535 will attempt to retain the path of any object moving in the same direction as it. If the target object moves in a horizontal path, SCP-535 will move in a vertical one until it reaches the target's eye level. If it cannot reach its target's eyes, SCP-535 will continue to move in the same direction as its target until it is within approximately 5 meters of them. In these circumstances, SCP-535 will release a cryogenic gas that causes frostbite on human skin in less than 10 seconds if inhaled; Prolonged exposure can cause frostbite to the lungs if not immediately dealt with.</p><p>When two or more objects are moving either horizontally or vertically at high speed (>200 km/h), SCP-535 instances organise themselves into formations resembling aircraft wings. These formations do not harm each other unless attacked; Instead, they act as containers for instances of SCP-632 and SCP-294 (extradimensional entities).</p><p>All instances carry a large amount of polyesters in their bodies; Humans who consume polyesters from a nonanomalous source often experience mild euphoria and fatigue shortly afterward. This effect can be amplified when polyesters are ingested through the oral cavity.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-535 was first discovered by the Foundation in ██████, ██, when a civilian reported his house had been broken into and his possessions stolen. Foundation agents were able to recover all other stolen property in the home. When asked about the whereabouts of the thieves, the civilian reported hearing a loud crash from inside his home. Upon entering, he found the house completely empty and lacking any trace of the intruders. He was then taken to Site-03 for questioning.</p><p>When questioned about the incident, the civilian reported that he had entered his home at approximately 2:00 am in search of a pair of glasses he was unable to find. After searching for several minutes in the living room, he heard a loud crash coming from the kitchen. Upon receiving no answer, he proceeded to investigate. When he reached the kitchen, he found his house empty and littered with partially-completed sculptures made of polyester. All sculptures were of an anatomically correct humanoid figure wearing a black suit and a hat with a visor. The figure was holding its arms out to its sides, resembling wings.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that all sculptures were within approximately 5 meters of each other; None were completed and many were damaged beyond repair. The fragments of sculptures resembled small cubes about 1 meter in size and were covered in white polyester fibers.']</p>
