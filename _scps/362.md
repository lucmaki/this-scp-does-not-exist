<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-362</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-361 is to be contained in a specially constructed containment chamber. The chamber is to be made from steel, with a security level of 3 ("Ceiling Carelessly Vented"). Any human that enters the chamber must be restrained at their least-dangerous movement before entering. Once inside the chamber, the door is to be closed and locked. At this point, the door must remain closed for 3 consecutive minutes and no staff members should enter or leave the room while in this state. This will continue until any entity exiting the chamber has experienced complete psychological and/or physical removal of all traumatic experiences (including but not limited to death, near-death, loss of limbs, bodily mutilation).</p><p>SCP-361's containment chamber is to receive no further alterations after initial construction, aside from rewiring the emergency exit in case of an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-361 is a humanoid entity that resembles a male adolescent with brown hair, blue eyes. While the subject's head and torso are intact, the rest of its body has been surgically altered to resemble a human made from plastic and metal.</p><p>SCP-361 is capable of communicating in a variety of languages that it learned through experience as a member of a traveling circus. It does not appear to exhibit any signs of age or gender, but claims to be female.</p><p>After having no contact for over 4 months (with the exception of brief, non-verbal interactions in passing), SCP-361 will begin speaking in an unfamiliar language if one is speaking to it directly. In this state, SCP-361 will become hostile towards those attempting to interact with it, often by violently hurling them against the walls or floor until they stop moving.</p><p>While SCP-361 appears to speak fluent English while cognisant, both recorded and spontaneous recordings have proven inconclusive on whether SCP-361 knows any languages other than his own.</p><p>As its designation suggests, SCP-361 is exceptionally good at throwing objects with great accuracy (often striking vital organs in the process). It usually uses these skills against anyone who initiates conversation with it.</p><p>Following an incident involving ███ Foundation personnel and multiple SCP objects (such as civilian casualties and damage to property), SCP-361 was declared Keter class and contained at Site-576.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-342 was first discovered on ██/01/2001, when a Foundation agent was sent to investigate a possible anomaly near ███████. Upon reaching the object, he reported that he could see a route through it. A radio transmission to Mobile Task Force Epsilon-7 (Mobile Task Force Omicron-7) was attempted; however, the signal was blocked by an unknown factor.</p><p>The following objects were observed traversing SCP-342 between the dates noted in brackets:']</p>
