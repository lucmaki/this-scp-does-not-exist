<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-839</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-839 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber, one size larger than its original containment cell. The interior of the cell is to be lined with 829 copies of "The New Labour Standards", and any further copies, printed or electronic, are to be destroyed on sight. SCP-839 is to be periodically injected with an antibiotic and given live-in caregivers 24/7 for observation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-839 appears to be a normal male Caucasian human, aged 37 years and 171 centimeters tall. SCP-839 is otherwise healthy, and has been given no unusual medical treatment or therapy. However, after the first year in containment, SCP-839 underwent a remarkable physical change. This was marked primarily by an approximately 100% increase in muscle mass, along with slight alterations in hair type, skin tone and distribution of body hair. After the change, SCP-839 had difficulty walking, as his bones and joints were not accustomed to the increased weight of his muscles; however he was able to walk normally despite this.</p><p>Following this growth, beyond one year of containment SCP-839 displayed very few outward signs of aging. The changes in height stopped at about 162 inches (4 meters), and skin color remained light even after two years of additional growth; hair color also did not change significantly. Upon reaching 3 years of containment SCP-839 continued to grow more rapidly until reaching its current height of 5 meters.</p><p>SCP-839 displays no anomalous effects following these changes other than its apparent youthfulness (which increases with time). Despite the physiological changes of SCP-839's body, no anomalous properties have been detected other than those listed above.</p><p>SCP-839 was not initially hostile or dangerous towards Foundation personnel and has been cooperative to date; however it has shown interest in books on human biology. Cadavers have been produced for testing purposes but are immediately incinerated upon discovery by SCP personnel. Class E staff are to undergo regular psychiatric checks before entering SCP-839's containment chamber due to the mental stress caused by its sudden increasing size over time.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On 4/21/15, SCP-839 attempted to escape from its containment chamber. Personnel attempted to stop it by throwing a number of objects at it. It responded by throwing a large metal water cooler at the personnel and then attempted to run towards the nearest exit. However, upon reaching the door, SCP-839 abruptly stopped moving, and began to shake violently for several minutes before expiring.</p><p>It was discovered that SCP-839 had torn a large hole through the wall of its cell, and had not been injured or affected in any way by this. The only damage to the wall was a series of small scorch marks where an unknown object had passed through it.</p><p>Approximately two days prior, SCP-839 had become much more lethargic, becoming unresponsive to verbal commands, as well as ignoring attempts to feed it. It eventually expired without further incident.']</p>
