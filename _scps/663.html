<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-663</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-663 is to be kept in a standard Safe class safety case. The case should be stored in storage locker 46 at Site-47. Any personnel assigned to the containment of SCP-663 are to be regularly checked for signs of exposure and removed from exposure without delay.</p><p>Any civilian personnel who show signs of an overdose should be administered naloxone.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-663 is a cartridge for a ██████ █████ cartridge-operated ████████ videogame console. SCP-663 has an average size of one and a half inches, with an untrimmed length of nine and a quarter inches. The cap on the case is black, representing the default color of the game cartridge, with white markings on the front indicating what command the keypad must be pressed to use that command.</p><p>Once turned on, SCP-663 can be used to play ████████ using a specially modified ████████ game cartridge and two AA batteries. The game has been modified to require activation by pressing and holding the 'Start' button before each level. Once activated, SCP-663 will not work unless held in place by the player.</p><p>Whilst playing, clearing blocks yields $100 for every block cleared and $50 for every second passed in gameplay. Clearing all blocks in a level yields $30,000, and a heart or block icon being filled grants 100 points. Aside from these changes, gameplay remains unchanged from the original version of the game.</p><p>If multiple players are playing together, each player receives an equal share of the money earned by cleared blocks or hearts based on their position on the leaderboard at the end of each level. Clear bonus levels or complete games in multiplayer mode will yield extra points if they are completed successfully.</p><p>If any user attempts to leave while playing, there is a chance they will overdose due to opioid toxicity (See Addendum). It is also possible that another player may become addicted through this method alone - See Addendum 663a/naloxone.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 663a:</strong> Overdose</p><p>During testing of SCP-663, one subject (SCP-663-1) was observed to have overdosed on an unknown opioid, and was exhibiting symptoms consistent with the use of an overdose. After recovering consciousness, SCP-663-1 reported that he was unable to move for several minutes. He then explained that the sensation of being unable to move had lasted for several hours before he had regained control.']</p>
