<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-314</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-314 is to be held in a standard, soundproofed humanoid containment chamber. SCP-314 has been supplied with an organic, edible diet, and small amounts of distilled water. No other liquids are acceptable. SCP-314 is to be supervised at all times, and all attempts to communicate with it by any means are to be restrained immediately.</p><p>SCP-314 is to be assigned one (1) human subject per week, who are to repeat lessons through the use of external audio devices. Once the lesson is completed, the subject is to be terminated via injection of potassium chloride at the base of the neck. Subjects may not be used more than once within any thirty-day period. The subject's body is to be discarded upon completion of instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-314 appears to be a male human, approximately 150 kg in weight and standing 1.7 m from the floor. SCP-314 functions as a human similarly to all other humans. It has, however, been observed to display an abnormal degree of sexual desire, which it expresses through various behaviors, including masturbation and sexual intercourse with several different women.</p><p>Interviewer: Dr. ████</p><p>Subject: SCP-314</p><p>[BEGIN LOG]</p><p>Dr. ████: Why are you thinking about sex?</p><p>SCP-314: Because I'm horny. I've been waiting to have sex for hours, but I won't until I see someone naked and they rub my cock while they're dancing naked on a table.</p><p>Dr. ████: Hmm… how do you know that dance is called "dancing naked on a table"?</p><p>SCP-314: I don't know, it's just the name of the dance now. And if I have sex before we have the dance then I'll have to wait even longer.</p><p>Dr. ████: Do you know who "we" are? You're not being entirely clear about this… what you mean by "someone naked and they rub my cock while they're dancing naked on a table," is that… dances? Or people that dance naked?</p><p>SCP-314: Who said it's people dancing? Maybe it's people that watch dancers and rub their cocks while they're watching dancers? Maybe there's a really small naked person running around on the dance floor and rubbing himself while he watches someone else dance in front of him? Or maybe it's just me thinking really hard about sex every day so I get really horny! Just because I'm horny doesn't mean anyone else should be, too! Right?</p><p>Dr. ████: No, right, right… to clarify, you'll say "people" dancing naked? Or "people watching dancers?" Is that clearer for you?</p><p>SCP-314: People watching dancers—it sounds more likely than people dancing naked themselves! Not everyone knows how to dance anyway! And like I said before—not everyone who knows how knows how to dance naked! They probably only know how to do the things normal people like to do at these events! Like going crazy when someone says something new or touching each other or grinding on each other or making out or whatever—that kind of stuff is gross! No one wants to see that! I only want to see someone naked dancing on a table! You can't stop me from seeing that!</p><p>Dr. ████ stands up and holds up both hands in front of SCP-314 via microphone feed. "You will do no such thing." A voice sounds over the intercom system within containment chamber 13. SCP-314 shows no sign of having identified its source as Dr. ████ drops his arms limply down toward his sides and begins pacing back and forth across the floor of containment chamber 13 at a slow pace. Dr. ████ places his headphones back over his ears and raises them partially up off his head so he can look across at SCP-314 while never completely ending eye contact with it throughout the entirety of his answer to the announcement from security personnel waiting outside containment chamber 13's door.</p><p>SCP-314 remains silent for approximately thirty seconds after Dr. ████ lowers his arms down beside him again before responding again with the same tone and volume as previously heard during the interview portion of this interview session.</p><p>Dr. ████: We can leave whenever you stop talking like this, okay? Now answer my question please… why are you thinking about "dancing naked on a table?" Are you saying there's actually something wrong with your genitals or something if you aren't planning on having sex soon enough? We have no idea what you mean when you say that word unless we ask what specifically makes you think of something deliberately causing physical pain to yourself or others—are you saying something like that happens when anyone does what normal people do? Because if so—you should be very careful about doing anything creepy in front of anyone else ever again; we don't know what else might happen otherwise! ********* please remember everything we talked about today because we probably won't get another chance for us all to learn some new things together like we did today unless you act nice from now on </p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong> On ██/██/████, SCP-314 was reported to be dancing naked on a table in a room at Site ██. Security forces were deployed and SCP-314 was restrained and restrained in a chair, and sedation administered to SCP-314 using Class-C amnestics. SCP-314 was removed from containment and returned to the Foundation's custody.</p>
