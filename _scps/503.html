<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-503</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-503 is kept in a Standard Containment Locker at Site-19, to which access has been restricted through the use of an electronic keycard. SCP-503 is to be approached only by personnel with Level 2 clearance or higher, and may only be accessed by Dr. ████ while wearing a full hazmat suit.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-503 is a collection of assorted macaroni-based confectionery products. The majority of these products may be purchased individually or in packs via online retailers. All products are produced by Parisian bakeries ███████, Ltd., and are considered to be the “premier macaroni eclairs” on the market. Other anomalous properties of SCP-503 products currently remain undocumented.</p><p>When SCP-503 products are eaten, they will appear to transform their subjects into macaroni-based furniture, usually consisting of dining room chairs, bookshelves in miniature form and various other similar consumer furniture items. Subjects appear to exist in an infinite loop for an indefinite amount of time, unless undisturbed by another subject consuming large amounts of SCP-503 products.</p><p>Subjects claimed as having consumed SCP-503 routinely report small (∼20) and large (8m) openings, located at varying points throughout their bodies. The dimensions of these openings range between 5mm and 10cm in size, easily allowing for objects to be inserted into the subjects' bodies. Testing has confirmed that the SCP-503 subjects are able to materialize any object through these openings.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-503 was discovered after the death of a ██████████ ████████, ██████, who had been working with Foundation researchers on the effects of anomalous objects. The subject had developed an unhealthy obsession with SCP-503 and was a frequent consumer of the products.</p><p>Two weeks prior to the discovery of SCP-503, experimental subjects were sent to the home of Mr. ████████, who had consumed large amounts of SCP-503 products over the course of two weeks. Upon retrieving his body from his home, it was determined that he had been converted into furniture upon death. Several other instances were also discovered, all converted into similar furniture pieces.</p><p>The Foundation was alerted to Mr. ████████'s death by a Foundation researcher whom Mr. ████████ had brushed against while shopping at the grocery store. Due to the nature of Mr. ████████'s death, it was classified as a suicide.</p>
