<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-739</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-739 is kept in a large storage locker at Site-19, along with a high-powered rifle and ammunition. Personnel assigned to the task of monitoring the whereabouts of SCP-739 are to be placed on regular rotation.</p><p>Should SCP-739 be observed to relocate, personnel are instructed to track its movements via satellite, and to prevent witnesses from becoming aware of the presence of SCP-739. If possible, agents are to contain SCP-739 long enough for negotiation or containment procedures to be undertaken by other Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-739 is an all-round sportsman and opponent of record, capable of handling any shooting or throwing event, as well as competing at a local level in many other sports.</p><p>SCP-739 appears to have died from a wound to the chest sustained during a hunting expedition, however subsequent testing has shown that it is impervious to injury. SCP-739 exhibits an unusually high level of physical fitness for its size and age, and has been observed to perform almost any activity with minimal effort; however, closer examination reveals that the body is composed entirely of cotton batting, including internal organs and bones. In experiments couched in terms of sport, equipment provided by the Foundation failed to damage SCP-739 whatsoever.</p><p>Although it consistently succeeds at activities on its own merit, SCP-739's competition results are disproportionately high compared to other participants. It is currently ranked number one in the United States in both rifle target shooting and skeet shooting events: two national records.</p><p>SCP-739 shares a casual acquaintance with several notable figures in American sports, including football players Peyton Manning and Joe Montana, baseball player Barry Bonds, basketball player Magic Johnson, Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn, Olympic medalists Michael Phelps and Missy Franklin.</p><p>It was formerly held by various other Foundation staff members until early 2015; since then there has been no reported sighting of SCP-739.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
