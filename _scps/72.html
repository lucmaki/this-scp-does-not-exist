<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-72</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-72 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-60. It is forbidden for any personnel to interact with SCP-72 for more than 30 seconds, as well as any interaction exceeding a 10 second window. Any bodily fluids are to be wiped off of SCP-72 once its effects expire. Only two experiments are permitted per week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-72 is a copy of "Star Trek : The Motion Picture" movie poster. It has been altered by placing a drawing of two people embracing each other, with the man's face being obscured by the woman's hand. SCP-72 was originally purchased at a thrift store in Hollywood, Ca at a cost of $1.00 as one of many books on display. A Foundation agent in charge of purchasing items for the Foundation at thrift stores was sent after SCP-72 and purchased it for $4.00. SCP-72 was introduced to SCP-72 following two days of observation.</p><p>SCP-72 is capable of affecting humans several different ways, though none have been observed outside of testing involving humans. When exposed to human skin, normal human activity will be carried out with greater force, speed and/or perseverance. It appears that SCP-72 causes its victims to focus on one task or goal, regardless of distractions. This effect persists until nearly all bodily functions have been carried out completely, including urination and defecation.</p><p>SCP-72 is non-anomalous when removed from human body parts or saliva, but becomes anomalous once inside a human body. As such, it cannot be removed or ejected from a living human without causing damage to the human victim. The only way to safely remove SCP-72 from an individual is through cauterization, as seen in Experiment 72-A01 - "Elimination".</p><p>SCP-72 does not seem to affect an individual that does not care about another individual or thing for an extended period of time. It is unknown whether this effect occurs before or after exposure to SCP-72.</p><p>SCP-72 was originally kept in a standard containment locker at Site-60 until 23/08/2015 when experiments involving it had been completed despite no less than five containment breaches by personnel within the same week. In light of recent events and security breaches within Site - 60 , the object has been moved to Site - 61 for further testing.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 72-A:</strong> Revision of Containment Procedures - 29/12/2017</p><p>After all testing for SCP-72 has been completed, the object will be reclassified. As such, the following containment procedures will be amended:</p><p>SCP-72 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-61. Personnel are to wear hazmat suits when entering the object's containment locker. All personnel are to have completed their annual influenza vaccinations."]</p>
