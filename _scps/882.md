<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-882</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The entire area of SCP-882 is to remain sealed off from outsiders. An automated barrier is to be erected around the object and active monitoring teams are to routinely patrol the perimeter.</p><p>No personnel are allowed within 0.5 km of SCP-882 without prior clearance from at least two (2) level 3 personnel.</p><p>All testing on SCP-882 must have approval by at least one (1) level 9 personnel, one (1) level 9 researcher, or the current site director. No unauthorized testing is allowed under any circumstances unless specifically approved by site director.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-882 is a large, monolithic boulder located at █████████, ██████. The object weighs in excess of 6,000 kg and is diamond-shaped. It is estimated to have been formed approximately ████ years ago.</p><p>SCP-882 possesses a number of unique properties that distinguish it from other similar objects. These properties cannot be detected by electromagnetic means.</p><p>The main argument for its classification as an anomalous object is that SCP-882 displays signs of sentience in its interactions with personnel. SCP-882 has demonstrated the ability to detect and react upon personnel approaching it. These reactions are not directed towards the detection of nearby life forms but rather at the individual that approaches it. If this individual is a known member of the staff or researchers classifications, SCP-882 will not react to them with violence or hostility, even if on multiple occasions they have attempted to provoke such an action.</p><p>SCP-882 also displays a secondary reaction to individuals who cannot be classified as staff members or researchers (please see addendum). When these individuals are placed near SCP-882, it will react violently with massive blasts of kinetic energy in their general direction which will not only decimate any nearby material but also induce severe concussive effects upon those nearby.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Incident Log 882-1</p><p>On ██/██/██, SCP-820 was discovered on the grounds of ████████ Hospital. When first discovered, SCP-820 was not active and its anomalous properties were not immediately apparent. After attempts to remove it failed, it was brought to Site ██ for initial containment. Subsequently, SCP-820 was discovered to be capable of acting as a mobile entity capable of moving at an average speed of ██m/s. When moved from one location to another, SCP-820 would attempt to destroy any nearby structures or structures that lined the path of its travel.</p><p>SCP-820's movement has been restricted to within the grounds of Site ██ and all personnel attempting to move it outside the site are now required to undergo a psychological examination before being allowed access.</p><p>Incident Log 882-1</p><p>07/08/██</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-829</p><p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p><p><strong>Object Description:</strong> A primitive wooden spear shaft with a blackened stone head attached with a leather strip. The object is decorated in crude pictographs with large red dots at the points of the spearhead, making it difficult to read.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Subject was instructed to touch the center of the object with his index finger and report any significant reaction."]</p>
