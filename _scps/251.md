<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-251</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-251 is stored in a 1.5m x 1.5m x 1 Item-929C shielded container at Site-77, with a remote keypad.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-251 is a large bag containing various objects.</p><p>In testing, the objects were repeatedly observed to levitate while being examined with a magnifying glass and then float towards the ceiling. SCP-251 should be stored in the upper portion of the containment chamber; if a capsule is inserted into the lower portion of the container, it will levitate up towards the ceiling as well.</p><p>Objects which are removed from SCP-251 after being subjected to its anomalous effect often display altered properties within an hour. The object will either spill its contents, or seemingly contain no contents at all. For instance:</p><p>The object also levitates when an analog clock is observed from directly above.</p><p>SCP-251's effect on biological organisms has not been tested. However, individuals who feel that they have seen this effect before (or simply feel that they "should know what it means") may report to Site-77 for further questioning. By sacrificing two (2) D-class personnel, SCP-251 can be activated to "teach" Foundation personnel about its properties in exchange for one (1) hour of subjective time during which all previous attempts at researching its anomalous properties are permanently erased. Information harvested by this method may not be used again; any suggestion of using SCP-251's anomalous property to learn more information will result in increased punishments for any individual who made such a suggestion.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-251 was recovered from a warehouse in [REDACTED] on ██/██/██ by Mobile Task Force Gamma-7 ("Cereal Killers"). The warehouse had been previously designated to be a safehouse for the █████████ Security Cooperative.</p><p>The warehouse was found to contain six (6) anomalous objects, including SCP-251. All objects were described as being "chaotic" by the surviving members of MTF-Gamma-7.</p><p>A member of MTF-Gamma-7 noted that SCP-251 was able to levitate, despite being sealed in a #929C container. When questioned about this, the Foundation agent replied "It\'s pretty obvious what it does. It\'s just a container."</p><p>The warehouse also contained two (2) bodies, along with several wheelbarrows full of dirt. After observing that the bodies were not moving, MTF-Gamma-7 members opened fire on them; all members survived with minor injuries.</p><p>During the raid, the Foundation agents discovered several anomalous objects:</p><p>SCP-251 is hereby classified as Neutralized.']</p>
