<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-256</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-256 is to be referred to as "The No Pants Joke" and examples of SCP-256-A should be made available to personnel which have previously participated in this study. If a test subject reports an instance of SCP-256, they are to be restrained and subjected to the standard interview process before testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-256 is the phenomenon where personnel lack adequate trousers. Patients experience various symptoms which are listed in the table below.</p><p>SCP-256 is not directly dangerous, but it can cause psychological damage if the individual becomes distressed by their condition or takes part in inappropriate behavior to avoid noticing. For added safety, testing is performed on research personnel and other staff members with no direct exposure to risk, or require showing respect to a higher authority.</p><p>As of 30/12/20██, the Foundation has contained 1517 paper records of SCP-256 (190 various universities and public schools). Of these records, 1008 instances involved staff and 1037 instances involved students.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong> On 03/03/20██, SCP-256 was discovered in a University of ████████████. Foundation agents were dispatched to kidnap the student responsible, and a cover story was established stating that he had been reported missing by his family. Interviews with the student revealed that he had no memory of his actions during the event and was unable to explain them. After the student was returned to his university, a letter was sent to the University of ████████████ requesting the return of SCP-256. The institution has not responded to this request.']</p>
