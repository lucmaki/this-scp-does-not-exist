<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-704</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The storage shelf containing SCP-704 is to be maintained at a temperature of no less than 5Â°C. In the event that this temperature is exceeded, the object should be returned to the department kitchen for immediate restoration of the ambient atmosphere.</p><p>Instructional materials are to be removed from the reading area only when an instructor has been given permission to do so by the current O Research Director. No personnel are permitted to enter the reading area of SCP-704 during a test unless their presence is documented in a log and approved by the O Research Director prior to testing commencing. Only one researcher may access SCP-704 at any time, and all tests involving its usage must be logged before being conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-704 is a shelf containing four volumes, each produced by an artist whose name is prefixed with the letter A, and each with its own cover illustration. The titles of the books are:</p><p>The books are organized in order according to the chronology of their production, but not in ascending or descending order of popularity. While it is impractical to maintain any relevant statistics on the sales of these books, it is estimated that fewer than fifty copies of each volume were ever printed.</p><p>Up to two artworks may be viewed at once by one reader. If more than one artwork is viewed by a reader simultaneously, all depictions will be interspersed and unsynchronized. Visual feedback occurs within seconds of viewing, but may take up to ten minutes before being perceived. If no artwork is viewed, information on individual artists' works can be inferred from their biographies in the table below.</p><p>The working title of SCP-704 was 'the Book Illustrated by Artists'.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Since the discovery of SCP-704, a total of 523 copies have been removed from [REDACTED].']</p>
