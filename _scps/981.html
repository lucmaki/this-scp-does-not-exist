<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-981</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-981 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at Site-77. SCP-981 is to be fed three times per day, the content of the meals being dictated by protocol 981-A, and should be provided with a daily supply of liquid fruit juice, red wine, or any other beverage suitable for human consumption. Personnel entering SCP-981's cell are to wear full body-suits and oxygen masks at all times.</p><p>Any personnel who have been infected with SCP-981 are to undergo immediate decontamination. Any personnel found to have been contaminated with SCP-981 must also be contained indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-981 is a humanoid specimen, approximately 1.8 meters tall, with a mass of 57 kilograms. SCP-981 displays no physical abnormalities beyond those common to humans; additionally, SCP-981 is capable of speech and the ability to write in cursive script.</p><p>SCP-981 was first discovered by Foundation researchers in ████████, Idaho, USA, on 04/██/19██. The Foundation had been alerted to its existence by a classified email from █████████████, who claimed that he had "misplaced" it shortly after it escaped from its owner's home some thirteen years prior.</p><p>The following is a transcript of a conversation between █████████████ and Dr. ██████████████, who were administering life-saving treatment to members of the local police force who had been exposed to SCP-981:</p><p>Dr. ██████████████: How many times have you made contact with the thing?</p><p>Mr. ██████████████: I dunno, actually. I'm pretty sure I've seen it twice now, but I don't get too close because it's dangerous; you know how they are.</p><p>Dr. ██████████████: It killed one of our men on the way here; we don't want to risk any more lives than we have to.</p><p>Mr. ██████████████: Well, I tell ya what; if it seems like your men need me again, give me a call and I'll come over and play with him for ya! He's really helpful when he ain't killing people! He fixes up my broken lawnmowers and stuff!</p><p>Dr. ██████████████: Sir . . . ?</p><p>Mr. ██████████████: Oh yeah! If you don't have time for him anymore, just send him over here 'n he'll fix our lawnmower for you! We really need someone around here to keep our yard nice an' green!</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/20██, an agent was assigned to SCP-981's cell and was discovered dead the following day. Autopsy records indicate that SCP-981 had removed the agent's organs and placed them in a plastic bag. After an investigation, SCP-981 was found in possession of several pounds of Foundation staff member organs. Interviews with SCP-981 have revealed that it believes that its actions are justified and necessary.</p>
