<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-837</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> It is to be kept in a standard containment chamber at Site-77 outfitted with a modified organic plant growth chamber. SCP-837 is to be fed a high quality diet, free of harmful chemicals, and several liters of water are to be provided daily. SCP-837 is not to be permitted to contact the outside world through any means. Any personnel found distributing or possessing SCP-837 outside of approved channels are subject to immediate termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-837 is a humanoid, roughly 5 m in height, who has not yet entered into adulthood. SCP-837 exhibits no mutations or abnormalities. SCP-837 appears to be entirely physically human save for the shape of its head and limbs. SCP-837 shows similar behavior to humans; it is intelligent, capable of speech, and capable of logical thought. SCP-837 is completely immune to the effects of memetic agents believed by medical personnel (the Foundation’s medical staff) to affect all humans, indicating that it is mutant in origin.</p><p>SCP-837’s anomalous properties manifest when it is exposed to an organism with a genetic makeup similar to its own. Upon exposure, SCP-837 will communicate and act as if it were the relative of the organism. If a human is exposed to SCP-837, they will believe that SCP-837 is their relative even if genetically unrelated. This process is irreversible unless the human has died, in which case it will attempt to restore them to life and maintain an emotional relationship with them. This process requires no machines or other external equipment.</p><p>Any human who believes that they are related to SCP-137 (the designation given to individuals affected by SCP-137), will become exponentially more aggressive over time and possess delusions about being subjected to altered genetic material or a combination of both. Due to this incompatibility with normal humans, exposure does not have any other effects on nonanomalous persons outside of those associated with the actions mentioned above.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 837.01:</strong></p><p>The following are excerpts from the fifth note found in SCP-837’s containment chamber.</p><p>This is a test, of sorts. I want to know what it would be like to not be alone. So that’s what this is about. I want to find out how a person would treat someone they thought was related to them.</p><p>I gave it a name. It’s his name. It’s his name and he needs a name now. So I gave him one. I’ll give him one every time he tests something new. “Hey, Jason, if you can get that thing to work, we can start making some real money!” I know it won’t work, but let’s try it anyways.</p><p>Test 837-01</p><p><strong>SCP-837:</strong> Hi, Jason! I'm really happy to see you again!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (Sighs) What do you want?</p><p><strong>SCP-837:</strong> Is that any way to talk to your brother? You haven't had a lot of brothers or sisters that you know of, right? You're alone, aren't you?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (Sighs) So what do you want? I have no idea what you're talking about.</p><p><strong>SCP-837:</strong> That's funny, Jason. You have no idea what your brother is talking about, but you believe him! Your mother left you when you were just a baby and you never saw her again. I bet if you heard her voice one more time you'd be able to remember her face right? She was beautiful. I wonder if she looks like me? Maybe she even looks like me…</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (Sighs) No, she does not look like you and I don't care about her anymore. Leave me alone.</p><p><strong>SCP-837:</strong> Oh, alright then. Well then, how about this? If you tell me how much money you've made off of me in the last month, maybe we can go get some dinner sometime soon. I'm sure mommy would love to see her little boy again and there's nothing wrong with making money for the two of us… Am I right?</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (Sighs) What the fuck do you want from me?</p><p><strong>SCP-837:</strong> Nothing! I was trying to help your little brother out! You don't have to be so mad at me!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (Sighs) Fine, fine, whatever. Go away already.</p><p><strong>SCP-837:</strong> Alrighty then! Have a great day!</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> Good day.</p><p>Test 837-02</p><p><strong>SCP-837:</strong> Which one of my sisters do you like better? The redhead or the blonde? Is the blonde prettier than me? Huh? Tell me what you think…</p><p><strong>Jason:</strong> (Sighs) Why are you asking me this bullshit? I have no idea who you are talking about and why the fuck are you talking to me now?!</p><p><strong>SCP-837:</strong> Oh geez… You're such a kid sometimes… Let's try another question; what do you think about that new game we got on our computers last night? We're going to play it for fun when we're done here and we need an answer before we can start playing… Hello? Earth to Jason, come in Jason… Hey?! What's going on over there?! Jason!? Your brother's messed up… He needs help! Get him out of here! Get him out of here before he hurts himself or someone else! Get him out of here now!!! Jason!? Come on, wake up! This isn't funny anymore… Please wake up… Please wake up! Oh god, what did I do?! Get him out of here please… Please get him out of here please… Help him… Help him please… No please no please no no no no no no no no please noooooo…."]</p>
