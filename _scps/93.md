<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-93</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A tracking device is to be installed in the ██████ Trading Company building in New York City. The facility is currently under Foundation control. All personnel entering the facility must wear an anti-dimensional interface system that neutralizes the anomaly. Project Safe Haven has been established to maintain and secure SCP-93.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-93 is an area of ██████ Trading Company, located in New York City, that seems to extend infinitely. Within this area exist SCP-93 instances, entities whose composition and appearance change depending on the environment of SCP-93. The exact number of SCP-93 instances is unknown, as the area of SCP-93 has never been fully explored.</p><p>Each instance is made up of the collective unconsciousness of all humans currently within the area designated to them by their designation numbers. Instances composing SCP-93 are able to communicate with each other through dreams and can project dreams onto living beings they encounter within SCP-93. While interacting with an SCP-93 instance from a different designation (designation numbers 1– 999) it is possible for a human subject to be covertly manipulated by the SCP-93 instance controlling them.</p><p>After being inside an SCP-93 instance for more than 24 hours, any human viewing the dream who does not have anti-dimensional interface system will begin the process of becoming an instance of the dreamscape. The instance will evolve and increase in size over time, attacking any humans not wearing anti-dimensional interface systems until all humans outside of their designated area have been digested or killed by their new environment. Any humans sleeping within an SCP-93 instance during this period will also be digested; one such subject was rescued after nine days inside an instance with no sleep deprivation noted.</p><p>SCP-173, who is regarded as neutral with respect to how it behaves in dreams, cannot enter an SCP-93 instance without coming out of containment. Once it enters someone's dream, a portal will appear at the location of its closest point to the dreamer and they will be drawn into it without any resistance unless they are wearing a device capable of countering this anomaly.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum-93.01:</strong> SCP-93 was found after Foundation agents in New York City reported a series of violent murders occurring within the city, followed by the discovery of a nightmarish version of New York City (designated SCP-93-██) that was home to several instances of SCP-93. The majority of these instances attacked and consumed the victims, but some took the form of other cities or landscapes and remained in place.']</p>
