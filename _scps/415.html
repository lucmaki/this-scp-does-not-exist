<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-415</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-415 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment lockbox. Personnel are instructed not to attempt to open SCP-415 for any reason, as the effect is permanent and irreversible.</p><p>All recordings of SCP-415 with live audience members are to be confiscated and destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-415 is a small video game named "Stuck on Russia" manufactured in 1982 by Independent Computer Systems, Inc. It is a simple maze game based on a popular arcade game of the same name.</p><p>When SCP-415 is played in the physical space it was designed for, the characters present will become hopelessly lost and unable to find their way out of the labyrinth they find themselves in. However, regardless of how many times this maze is played, SCP-415's anomalous effect remains in effect; thus, any attempt to locate the exit will result in losing all sense of direction, even though there exists an unobstructed path leading away from the current maze.</p><p>SCP-415 does not display any effects if played in another room or location where it has no influence on events or people already present. If one attempts to create a copy of SCP-415 that can be played by other individuals, this copy will also result in lost subjects and continue to display the anomalous properties of its predecessor.</p><p>SCP-415 was created after Dr. Kirke read about a similar cube puzzle published by Baskin & Baskin featuring music composed by Alexei Tolstoy in 1976 titled "Singing Spoons". Tolstoy had previously written several television shows and movies with Soviet-era themes and was known for his prolific output. Dr. Kirke was interested enough in the topic to watch these programs himself, but found that they were difficult to watch due to the Communist Party's policies against home entertainment devices. However, while watching one of these shows he saw a promotional advertisement for SCP-415 and found it intriguing enough that he contacted ICSI after class to inquire about purchasing copies for herself and her students.</p><p>While attempting to purchase copies of SCP-415 from ICSI headquarters in Los Angeles, Dr. Kirke discovered they were also broadcasting live broadcasts from their headquarters during a live talk show featuring their employees talking about random topics such as knowledge on Brazilian jiujitsu or Canada's largest department store chain. One employee went as far as to state that "Baskin & Baskin have never actually employed anyone working on SCP-415" and that "All employees are fully prepared for us to shut down our manufacturing facilities at any time." After this incident, ICSI appears to have stopped pursuing production of SCP-415 entirely.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
