<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-735</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area of SCP-735 is to be monitored twenty-four hours a day by at least four Foundation personnel. Any signs of activity are to be reported immediately to Dr. ████.</p><p>If the Moon's cycle occurs during the night, local police and emergency services are to be notified of the situation before any major containment procedures are enacted. The security perimeter around the SCP-735 site is to be kept cordoned off with minimum visual and audio access.</p><p>In the event that the Moon's cycle coincides with an organized celebration or event, Foundation personnel are to be placed in strategic locations on-board vehicles and aircraft, as well as on rooftops within the containment area.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-735 is an anomalous phenomenon which occurs when the Moon is at its last quarter or first quarter, which coincides with either the day after a full moon or the day before a new moon. The area of effect varies, depending on the date.</p><p>The effect of SCP-735 is to cause all individuals within the affected area to become extremely superstitious, to the extent that they believe that an eclipse is occurring.</p><p>Affected individuals will begin by behaving in a manner compatible with their beliefs, such as standing still, turning away from the sun, covering their eyes and mouths with cloth, etc. As time goes on and their behavior becomes more extreme, they will begin to experience other symptoms including severe anxiety, nausea, a feeling of nausea, headaches, hallucinations and insomnia. They believe that if they do not experience these things during an eclipse, they will die. Some have reported experiencing panic attacks similar to those experienced by victims of Hitchcock's Syndrome.</p><p>If there are no signs of life in any location near the boundaries of SCP-735, it will become active again after 18 hours. If any living beings enter the area during this time period, SCP-735 will activate instantaneously and terminate all life forms within the containment area. However, if it activates while humans are present inside a vehicle or building that is located within the containment zone of SCP-735, then it will not activate unless someone tries to exit the vehicle or jumps out of the window.</p><p>SCP-735 was discovered when two Foundation researchers were engaged in observation of SCP-███ in ██████ ████ when they noticed a large crowd gathering outside of town. They immediately notified local police and attempted to contain the situation before further anomalous activity took place. The resulting incident had no known casualties but caused significant damage to infrastructure and property throughout ██████ ████.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 735-1:</strong> During the ██/██/██ lunar cycle, a portion of SCP-735 was found to have developed into a large city located at the center of a large circle. The city is composed of several high-rise buildings which are connected by a series of overpasses.</p><p>The buildings and streets have been constructed in a manner comparable to that of modern architecture. The buildings appear to be occupied by several thousand residents who continue with their daily schedule despite the fact that they are completely unaware of each other. They live and die under the same sun, and still behave as if an eclipse was occurring.</p><p>So far, we do not know how they manage to obtain food, water, etc., but we are monitoring their daily routines and observing any changes that might be occurring.</p><p>While the majority of buildings are made of concrete and cement, many building incorporate other materials such as steel, wood, glass, etc. These materials are used at the discretion of each building's architect.", 'Addendum 735-2: On ██/██/████ during the lunar cycle, a portion of SCP-735 began to experience a phase in which its boundaries expanded. By the time Foundation personnel arrived on the scene, it had encompassed a substantial area and was encircling at least half of what appeared to be a small city. The city itself is about four kilometers wide and includes a number of homes and buildings that appear to have been constructed using what appears to be a combination of copper, aluminum, and plastic materials. They also appear to use modern building techniques such as air conditioning, wiring, plumbing and security systems.</p><p>The people that live in this section of SCP-735 report experiencing no changes or anomalies despite being completely unaware that anything is happening.</p><p>No denizens of this new city have been observed to partake in any sort of religious or superstitious behavior. Instead they appear to be normal people going about their daily lives dressed in normal clothes and conducting normal activities. During interviews, they reported no prior knowledge that there was an event taking place beyond the confines of their own houses.</p><p>One researcher who entered into this new section began to experience headaches and hallucinations so severe that he required treatment outside the area. However, after retreating from the city he was back to normal within 24 hours.']</p>
