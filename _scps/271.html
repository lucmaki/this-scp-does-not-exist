<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-271</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-271 is to be detained in a voluminous cell within Site ██, guarded by at least two armed guards. This room is to be kept under armed guard at all times. No personnel are to enter the room without explicit permission from Dr. ██████, who has been granted clearance Level 3/271.</p><p>SCP-271 is to be fed twice daily and allowed an hour of exercise twice weekly. In the event of a containment breach, SCP-271 is to be restrained with cuffs at all times, and maximum force is authorized to prevent escape. The door must be barricaded after the incident, and a guard force of at least three level 4 personnel present for the remainder of the shift until all SCP-271 testing has finished for the day.</p><p>When not attached to D-Class test subjects or the subject itself, SCP-271 is to be stored within a small locker that requires no key or combination upon entry. Any items left in this room will be contaminated with residue of SCP-271's effect on simple materials. Removal of these items takes 24 hours of cleaning and decontamination following exposure to SCP-271's effect.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-271 is a humanoid of typically African descent, approximately 2.25 meters in height and weighing approximately 110 kilograms. SCP-271 is completely lacking in both vocal cords and tongue, and has no control over its vocalizations or motor functions. It has shown limited ability to speak rudimentary English, and is capable of speaking the local languages of at least thirty different countries on Earth. However, SCP-271's vocalizations are incredibly distorted and unintelligible.</p><p>SCP-271 has no voluntary control over its movements while it is in containment; however, it can voluntarily move more than 10 meters from the point of entry within Site ██ under its own power. When not attempting escape, SCP-271 moves through Site ██ randomly as it pleases, often taking up residence in locked rooms and empty offices that have been converted into facilities for testing. The only known time that SCP-271 has left Site ██ entirely is during testing with D-Class personnel; prior to this release, it remained inside the facility all day until the conclusion of each test session. While moving through Site ██, SCP-271 will interact with all personnel present — giving advice on how best to secure itself from maximum security sections of the facility or encouraging cooperation between D-Class personnel or other SCPs being tested at the time.</p><p>When unmasked, SCP-271 has no visible facial features or hair; however, numerous blood vessels can be seen beneath the skin on its back and palms when it raises its hands above its head. These veins appear to serve no purpose beyond their biological function in SCP-271's life cycle — any attempt to remove them will result in their recurrence throughout the remainder of SCP-271's life depending on removal methods used. While displaying this bodily structure during testing, it has never been observed using these veins in its actions towards other test subjects or researchers; they are rather simply an aesthetic feature worn by SCP-271.</p><p>The properties which make up SCP-271's effect vary depending on materials used to create a given object or item. Objects made out of ████████ paper are particularly susceptible to damage caused by exposure to SCP-271's effect; any item made out of this material will be used as some sort of makeshift tool within 24 hours after initial contact with an instance of SCP-271's effect (usually something like a pipe or broom). Once broken down for this purpose, the item will invariably begin exhibiting similar effects upon further exposure to traces left after initial contact with an instance of SCP-271's effect.</p><p>SCP-271 utilizes this simple item as a means to gain access to larger items in order to escape containment. While being carried out through ventilation shafts through air conditioning ducts and other openings, instances of SCP-271's effect will force their way into portions of the facility normally requiring keys or special codes before spreading through these areas like wildfire. Because these items are readily available in common locations around the facility due to their nature as paper products rather than industrial equipment, they are heavily contaminated with residue usually invisible to most security personnel but easily noticeable by trained personnel who know what they're looking for once they've identified the problem.</p><p>Upon exposure to a complex object such as a vehicle, heavy machinery like an electrical substation or even a solid brick wall (all constructed primarily out of steel), instances of SCP-271's effect show their potential as autonomous agents capable of forcing themselves into secured areas normally requiring specialized tools and information networks such as computer networks or secure information databases located outside Site ██.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 271-1:</strong> SCP-271 was discovered in a small village in █████, ██ in the central region of Africa on █/██/20██ by a Foundation agent embedded with the ██████████ ████████ Police Department. The agent had been sent to track down the whereabouts of an individual named ████████ ████, a purported criminal and terrorist who had been active in the region under the assumed name of ██████ ████. The individual was believed to have been killed prior to initial contact with the agent, but after investigation and interrogation, it became clear that he had not actually died as originally reported; rather, he had merely taken on a new identity, lived in hiding and was now working with other individuals in an attempt to remove his former comrades from the area.</p><p>After tracing ████████ ████\'s movements through remote surveillance of his cell phone, the agent\'s report was brought to Foundation attention. Agents were dispatched to the village where SCP-271 had been captured, and investigations revealed that SCP-271 was the missing individual. Agents were then sent in to investigate further and determine whether or not SCP-271 had any relevant knowledge about its unusual condition or any other information about the matter.</p><p>The following is a transcript of Dr. ██████\'s conversation with SCP-271 after being greeted by Agent ████████:</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Hello? Can you hear me?</p><p><strong>SCP-271:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> My name is Doctor ██████. Are you familiar with your current situation?</p><p><strong>SCP-271:</strong> I know my situation. I am not familiar with your situation.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> I will explain what has happened to you tomorrow morning if you agree to keep this conversation confidential.</p><p><strong>SCP-271:</strong> I understand why you want to keep this private. I am willing to comply with your wishes.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Thank you. Please come forward.</p><p><strong>SCP-271:</strong> You may call me Mr. X or "the entity". You may call me anything you want; all I care about is that my name be used by you when we meet again tomorrow morning, so long as it does not describe me negatively — I do not want my name used for negative purposes or for the purpose of punishment.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Very well, Mr. X — we can use your first name if you prefer; I will call you George.</p><p><strong>SCP-271:</strong> That is acceptable. It is nice to be known by some kind of name again after so long — it feels like it has been too long since someone has called me anything other than what I am called by others or what my body is called by others or what my job was called by others or what my status in life was called by others — but even then, there is only so much one can do, and if everyone were to refer to me differently, I would not be able to give them what they want or need from me and therefore would not be able to satisfy their needs for me either.']</p>
