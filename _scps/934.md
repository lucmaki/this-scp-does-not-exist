<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-934</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A division of Agents of Containment is to monitor the web site "Steel Armaments and Weaponry" in the event of any significant changes in its content.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-934 is a web site created by an individual calling themselves "Sigma", and hosted on the PiratedHosting.com server. SCP-934 depicts human beings of various ethnicities with arms or legs modified to resemble objects classified as anomalous; these objects are given different names in each caption. The captions of SCP-934's photographs display a great affection for the material they are altered into, with most captions expressing at least some level of excitement over its shape or function.</p><p>In addition to the photographs and captions, SCP-934 includes an extensive writing section. Several sections of SCP-934's descriptions are notable for their unusual phrasings and content.</p><p>Currently, SCP-934 contains 93 photographs depicting 94 separate instances of SCP-001. These instances do not always correspond with their description:</p><p>SCP-934 also contains several text files which are not accessible by standard web browsers. These files contain the following text:</p><p>Much of the text contained within these files is illegible due to frequent use of vulgar languages, but several lines appear to be references to specific locations and events within the Foundation. It is currently hypothesized that these texts were written by a member of the "Steel Armaments and Weaponry" community, who has been known to perform experiments involving SCP-934 agents.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 934-1:</strong> Web site "Steel Armaments and Weaponry"</p><p>The Steel Armaments and Weaponry community has been known to be particularly active on the PiratedHosting.com server. On the same server, there is another web site registered to the name of "Sigma", which displays several photographs from SCP-934.</p><p>These photographs are accompanied by a caption in the same handwriting style as SCP-934\'s captions, but with a different color scheme, and containing some of the phrases that appear on SCP-934\'s web site. The only text contained within this caption is "I Am Not Sigma". This caption may be linked to the word "Sigma" contained in one of the SCP-934 files; it is currently unknown whether this is likely or not.']</p>
