<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-639</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All copies of SCP-639 and its supplementary documents, entitled "SCP-639: A Journey to the End of the World", are to be kept at Site-64 for research purposes. Due to potential harm to civilians and Foundation personnel, major public and Foundation events should be avoided until research is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-639 is a physical copy of a children's storybook entitled "Max on a Roller Coaster". The book was published in an edition of ████ copies. All printed copies have been found to be missing their covers, and the printing plates are all damaged and burned as if they had been melted by intense heat. The purpose of SCP-639 is currently unknown. Each page contains colorful illustrations depicting several individuals, with the first being a humanoid male character labeled SCP-639-1 designated Max.</p><p>SCP-639 shows no signs of aging and its pages (save for the first) have never been opened. Due to this, the original print format cannot be identified beyond that of a paperback book. Without opening the book, it is impossible to determine if pages exist after the first one, nor if any other documents are hidden within the book when opened.</p><p>Each page describes a specific incident that occurs on an unidentified roller coaster. The text and illustrations clearly detail an escalating blood bath, ending with what appears to be Max dead at the bottom of an apparently abandoned rollercoaster car at dawn. The last illustration depicts a partially obscured figure in white robes approaching what appears to be Max's grave and two gravestones bearing dates earlier than the actual death of Max himself. A note attached reads "I only hope I can live up to your expectation."</p><p>The Foundation discovered the existence of SCP-639 after several complaints from eyewitnesses involved in various incidents reported by various news media outlets in early 2005. Initial research concluded that these incidents were likely caused by mass hysteria due to moral panic regarding dangerous amusement park rides and subsequent cover-ups similar to those found with SCP-███ and SCP-████.</p><p>Following moderate success at suppressing public knowledge of such incidents, Foundation personnel underwent training in psychological warfare and crisis management to focus on suppressing knowledge of SCP-639 itself and subsequent media coverage. After several weeks of training, operatives were given the task of establishing an undercover presence in MSNBC news network talk shows to stop broadcasts related to the incidents occurring at parks across the country. As time went on, additional agents were placed in NBC Moscow offices with orders to spread false information about Russian involvement through rumors originating from Russian defectors living in or near San Francisco, California.</p><p>After several months, reports began surfacing in major newspapers regarding mysterious attacks perpetrated against parkgoers by "gruesome masked cultists", which brought about further public panic and outrage. By January 2006, most members of public had forgotten about previous incidents entirely due to lack of media attention devoted to them since leaving office in early 2005; however, most members of Foundation Task Force Sigma (formerly MTF Sigma) had expended months of effort uncovering links between these events and SCP-639 while still remaining undetected by civilians.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
