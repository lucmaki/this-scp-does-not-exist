<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-279</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-279 is to be kept under video surveillance within a secure containment room and fed twice daily with one of its preferred foods. If a safe rate of growth and development can be obtained, or if the specimen in question does not respond to other methods of food supplementation, the anomalous effects of SCP-279 may be suppressed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-279 is an intelligent ant of the genus Pheidole. SCP-279 is around 2mm in length and has no apparent anomalous qualities except for its intelligence, which has been established through observation and experimentation. It weighs approximately 3.2 grams at the start of containment, and has been observed to grow at a rate of 0.13 grams per day since it first entered containment.</p><p>When food (preferably meat) is presented to SCP-279 in the form of crumbs or small pieces, it will attempt to eat food from any available source. If not satisfied with its current intake, it will hunt for more food until it is satiated. The specimen will return to its nest to store the recently-obtained food in preparation for a second feeding. When deprived of sufficient nutrition, SCP-279 may grow up to two times faster than usual, but otherwise undergoes no other abnormalities.</p><p>SCP-279 is capable of learning many social behaviours that are typical of ants, including worker behaviour and gathering food together with pheromone communication. However, unlike normal ants it seems to exhibit some intelligent control over this learning process; it has been shown capable of practicing complex strategies such as looking for food outside their colony's boundaries when they believe their colony does not have access to any outside food sources. In addition, SCP-279 exhibits a high level of emotional development, reacting with great distress as it begins to lose its appetite for fleshy food such as animal carcasses or ectoentities preserved in jars full of salt water.</p><p>SCP-279 also exhibits strong curiosity and curiosity about the beyond nature on several occasions. Other ants have measured its curiosity by observing where SCP-279 would go when given the option between its colony and a room filled with various objects in different states of decay (ranging from "charming" to "disgusting"). While conducting these tests on SCP-279, several other ants have observed instances of SCP-279 repeatedly exploring areas distant from its nest after being released there free of charge; while they do transmit pheromones towards their nest during these explorations, they appear to be incapable of deciding whether or not they wish to return in response.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong> SCP-279 was discovered by the Mobile Task Force Sigma-3 when it entered a human home in ██████, Florida carrying a severed hand and screaming with great distress. The task force agent who discovered the specimen was given a class-B amnestic prior to interrogation. Interviews with other members of the task force confirm that the rest of the team did not expect SCP-279 to possess any anomalous properties. Several other similar instances were also discovered during this same incident, leading to the establishment of a Foundation front company called "Forced Interdimensional Transmissions".</p>
