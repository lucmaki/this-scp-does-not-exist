<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-159</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-159 is kept in the General Containment Wing of Site-25's Xenotime Wing. The purpose of this wing is to house anomalous flora which cannot be contained on standard Foundation grounds. SCP-159 is to be kept in an indoor enclosure, watered and fed daily. Any damage caused by SCP-159 to Foundation personnel or other manned objects are to be repaired immediately by maintenance staff.</p><p>No personnel are allowed on site, except those with Level 4 or above security clearance. Upon entering the containment chamber of SCP-159, all personnel are to wear a pair of reinforced goggles, specialized to protect against the radiation, and neutralized with a spray of sodium cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-159 is an immature sunflower, which reached a roughly humanoid form. SCP-159's anomalous properties were only first noticed when a team of researchers attempted to take a photo of it, and instead saw a field of yellow flowers. While SCP-159 does not seem to be telepathic or violent towards humans, it continuously sends out radiation for no apparent reason. It has been found that the radiation is indistinguishable from the radiation given off by a star of its type and lifetime. (See attached excerpt of 4/11/2015 Experiment 159-2)</p><p>SCP-159 appeared in █████, Kentucky on 4/17/19██. The town had initially been abandoned due to bad weather, resulting in some damage to local human habitations after an undetermined amount of time passed. No signs of life were found in the town, except for SCP-159 itself, which was found alive and well after the storm passed. After several days, SCP-159 began exhibiting abnormal behavior; repeatedly touching itself on the head and standing up with difficulty, though this did not stop after it received aid from Foundation personnel.</p><p>When interviewed, the owner of the house stated she was unaware of the foundation of this flower until receiving Foundation agents attempting to acquire it as a sample. Her response was that she had never observed any flowering plants in her garden before, showing no prior knowledge about this flower or its anomalous properties.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 159-A:</strong></p><p>Excerpt of 4/11/2015 Experiment 159-2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>[…]</p><p><Begin Log></p><p>[…]</p><p>SCP-159 stands up, and begins walking across the room. SCP-159 pauses for a moment before returning to its sitting position and closing its eyes, obviously asleep. (After this point, SCP-159 slept for approximately 6 hours.)</p><p>[…]</p><p>[…]</p><p>SCP-159 stands up once again. SCP-159 then walks towards the door, which opens itself from the other side. SCP-159 then enters the hallway beyond the door, disappearing after it leaves the room. Personnel are ordered to not leave the room until all tests are completed, as the radiation levels in the room caused them to feel slightly nauseous.</p><p>The personnel then enter the hallway SCP-159 had entered, finding it empty. SCP-159 is not found in this hallway, nor is it found anywhere else in the house. (This was done under supervision of Dr. █████.)</p><p>[…]</p><p><End Log></p>
