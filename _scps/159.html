<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-159</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-159 is kept in the General Containment Wing of Site-25's Xenotime Wing. The purpose of this wing is to house anomalous flora which cannot be contained on standard Foundation grounds. SCP-159 is to be kept in an indoor enclosure, watered and fed daily. Any damage caused by SCP-159 to Foundation personnel or other manned objects are to be repaired immediately by maintenance staff.</p><p>No personnel are allowed on site, except those with Level 4 or above security clearance. Upon entering the containment chamber of SCP-159, all personnel are to wear a pair of reinforced goggles, specialized to protect against the radiation, and neutralized with a spray of sodium cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-159 is an immature sunflower, which reached a roughly humanoid form. SCP-159's anomalous properties were only first noticed when a team of researchers attempted to take a photo of it, and instead saw a field of yellow flowers. While SCP-159 does not seem to be telepathic or violent towards humans, it continuously sends out radiation for no apparent reason. It has been found that the radiation is indistinguishable from the radiation given off by a star of its type and lifetime. (See attached excerpt of 4/11/2015 Experiment 159-2)</p><p>SCP-159 appeared in █████, Kentucky on 4/17/19██. The town had initially been abandoned due to bad weather, resulting in some damage to local human habitations after an undetermined amount of time passed. No signs of life were found in the town, except for SCP-159 itself, which was found alive and well after the storm passed. After several days, SCP-159 began exhibiting abnormal behavior; repeatedly touching itself on the head and standing up with difficulty, though this did not stop after it received aid from Foundation personnel.</p><p>When interviewed, the owner of the house stated she was unaware of the foundation of this flower until receiving Foundation agents attempting to acquire it as a sample. Her response was that she had never observed any flowering plants in her garden before, showing no prior knowledge about this flower or its anomalous properties.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
