<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-649</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-649 is to be kept in a standard Safe storage locker at Site-19. No personnel are to open SCP-649 without prior testing; if the locker door has been opened and the internal temperature of SCP-649 rises above 30°C, Foundation countermeasures must be enacted immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-649 is a map of Europe consisting of two sheets of paper measuring 2.6 x 3.7 cm. The map appears to be drawn in a stylus by an adult hand, though the style of drawing does not appear to match any known individuals on record. A note was found with SCP-649, containing the written words:</p><p>Good luck finding your way home !!! You’re not alone.</p><p>In addition, a series of circles and lines have been drawn across the map, covering approximately 1/100th of the area; these have been noted as being similar in appearance to SCP-███ and SCP-███, respectively.</p><p>The object shows no signs of wear or damage aside from slight discoloration caused by exposure to light at temperatures exceeding 30°C. A moderate degree of humidity has also had little effect on the object's condition; SCP-649 can be stored in a sealed container for months without showing any sign of degradation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
