<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-649</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-649 is to be kept in a standard Safe storage locker at Site-19. No personnel are to open SCP-649 without prior testing; if the locker door has been opened and the internal temperature of SCP-649 rises above 30°C, Foundation countermeasures must be enacted immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-649 is a map of Europe consisting of two sheets of paper measuring 2.6 x 3.7 cm. The map appears to be drawn in a stylus by an adult hand, though the style of drawing does not appear to match any known individuals on record. A note was found with SCP-649, containing the written words:</p><p>Good luck finding your way home !!! You’re not alone.</p><p>In addition, a series of circles and lines have been drawn across the map, covering approximately 1/100th of the area; these have been noted as being similar in appearance to SCP-███ and SCP-███, respectively.</p><p>The object shows no signs of wear or damage aside from slight discoloration caused by exposure to light at temperatures exceeding 30°C. A moderate degree of humidity has also had little effect on the object's condition; SCP-649 can be stored in a sealed container for months without showing any sign of degradation.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum SCP-649-1:</strong> On 11/10/1985, the object was found abandoned in an alleyway in ██████, England. The object was intact and the note was present, but the "refugees" that have been referenced in the note never existed; no evidence of them has ever been found.</p><p>SCP-649\'s anomalous properties manifested after its discovery.</p>
