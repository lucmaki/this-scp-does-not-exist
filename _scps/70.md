<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-70</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All known instances of SCP-70 are to be studied and documented. As many instances as possible are to be kept on-site within Site-64. All areas affected by SCP-70 are to be covered with photovoltaic panels, and the area in question is designated as an off-limits area. No equipment or personnel should be brought into or out of this area without preapproval from at least two (2) different Level 3 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-70 is a phenomenon that occurs once every three years, affecting areas within the Embassy district in Washington D.C. The first recorded occurrence occurred on December 30th, 1999. During this event, all electronics in the region were either destroyed or rendered unusable. A second recorded occurrence occurred on December 29th, 2001. During this event, all electronics were lost. A third documented SCP-70 event occurred on November 18th, 2004. No electronic devices have been located after this time frame in the Embassy area.</p><p>During an SCP-70 event, all electronics within a 5-meter radius of SCP-70 will cease to function. All electronics within wireless range of SCP-70 will become completely nonfunctional and random numbers will be displayed on any computer connected to a network card containing a hard drive containing data relevant to electrical systems or to factories that produce electronic devices. TV sets and VCRs will display images related to technology used by factories and manufacturing plants at random intervals as well as standard clock displays, functioning only when directly connected to AC power sources. Only radio equipment during this time period has been found to consistently produce audible sounds; whether these sounds are intended for human hearing is unknown.</p><p>The Institute for Future Technology has been investigating the properties of SCP-70 and is currently attempting to find an explanation for its origin and effect.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On July 29th, 2007, a message was discovered on the back side of a computer monitor in Site-64's computer lab. The message contained a series of numbers, which were revealed to be coordinates indicating the location of SCP-70. These coordinates are as follows:</p><p>Site-64 is currently investigating this area for further information or possible remnants of SCP-70."]</p>
