<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-680</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-680 is kept in an airtight container with a lid. Containment chamber 1 is to be filled to 4 m with inert mineral salt and placed in a temperature-controlled storage room with heating elements. SCP-680's containment chamber is to be equipped with an osmotic pump, which allows seawater to enter as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-680 is a twenty (20) cm long Ancient Greek tuning fork (tf) with a small hole drilled through its handle. The sound produced by SCP-680 is that of a single note, now designated as "A" at 440 Hz. A tape recorder, to which SCP-680 was attached and subsequently removed, was found within the remains of SCP-680's storage chamber. The contents of the tape are currently being analyzed by the Foundation's audio experts.</p><p>SCP-680 induces a dissociative state in all non-Anomalous humans within 5 m. Test subjects report feeling light headed and their vision becomes blurred. After approximately one minute they begin experiencing strong wind gusts and heavy rainfall in a circular pattern centered on SCP-680. Within three minutes, the effects become violent and test subjects report severe pain in their joints, back and neck. Wind strength increases steadily until sixty seconds after the first use of SCP-680, when it becomes impossible for any human to escape its effect without serious injury or incapacitation.</p><p>The following data has been extracted from video surveillance evidence:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
