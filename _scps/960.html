<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-960</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-960 is to be kept in a standard storage locker at Site-19 under the guise of an abandoned filing cabinet. SCP-960's lock has been modified to prevent external access, and may only be opened by personnel assigned to the object's secondary containment procedures.</p><p>SCP-960 is to be cleaned by hand twice weekly. SCP-960 is also to be monitored for any signs of corrosion, deterioration or wear of its components. Any such signs are to be noted and reported to the current Head Researcher or Deputy Head Researcher assigned to SCP-960.</p><p>The following are not considered an instance of SCP-960:</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-960 is a pillowcase bearing a handwritten note "Found in the ruins of [REDACTED]" and a crude drawing of a human face.</p><p>SCP-960 is currently believed to be the source of numerous disappearances and extinctions recorded among the aboriginal populations of [REDACTED]. The Foundation was alerted to SCP-960 after reports were filed by members of [DATA EXPUNGED] regarding a variety of unusual phenomena associated with the region, including:</p><p>SCP-960 was recovered during a joint Foundation/MTF raid on an undisclosed location in [REDACTED], following a string of disappearances. Initial attempts to identify the anomalous nature of the object met with failure, as its anomalous properties only became apparent when it was removed from its original resting place. The object moved over █ kilometers away from its original resting place before being seized by Foundation forces.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
