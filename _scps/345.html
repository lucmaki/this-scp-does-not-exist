<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-345</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid-Po</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-345 is kept in a locker in a Geological and Paleontological research facility. Researchers should not approach it without the presence of several security personnel, as contact with its surface causes extreme psychological distress.</p><p>As SCP-345 is known to be hard to destroy, no action is currently taken to contain it. In case of emergency, it may be destroyed by dropping a large stone on top of it. This can be repeated as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-345 is a metallic cylinder, roughly 8 m long and 4 m high. Its surface looks like a map of the world's ocean depths. A detailed map of the Atlantic Ocean has been made using SCP-345, but it is invisible to all except underwater creatures.</p><p>SCP-345 was found on the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Greenland by several fisherman who were unaware of its anomalous properties. Dr. █████, Senior Researcher for the Department of Geological Sciences, was observing SCP-345 when it suddenly activated, causing severe dizziness and nausea to her. She soon recovered and confirmed that SCP-345 emitted an unusually strong magnetic field that forced nearby iron objects to align with it; this behavior had been observed in previous tests. Both Foundation personnel involved were informed of its anomalous properties but decided not to report them at the time.</p><p>The Foundation acquired SCP-345 from Dr. █████ after her retirement from the Foundation and transferred it to a suitable containment unit. Containment procedures have been updated over time in response to changes in the object and its effects.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
