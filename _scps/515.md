<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-515</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-515 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, to which only Class 2/515 personnel have access. The SCP-515 is to be stored following the guidelines established by Department of Redundancy Department and may not be removed from its containment locker without permission. SCP-515 may only be handled with a thin pair of tweezers or forceps.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-515 is a pair of thumbtack dispensers, manufactured by Standard Industries. The dispensers are marked with the words "In case of emergency, break this glass. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN." The dispensers are connected via a twelve gauge copper wire.</p><p>In the event that any human comes into contact with SCP-515, they will be immediately affected by the dispenser. Upon removing the thumbtack from their finger, the affected individual will have all other joints jammed by the thumbtack. Approximately sixteen hours after being affected, the affected individual will develop greyish hard skin, similar to crabs or octopuses. This skin is lighter than normal human flesh, and has an unusually high tolerance to physical trauma.</p><p>Subjects that survive to thirty days post-initialization of this effect include test subjects who are subjected to extremely difficult or dangerous tasks such as excavating mountains or swimming in shark infested waters. Subjects that survive longer than ninety days retain this anomalous property (around 3% chance per month). In addition, these subjects find it extremely difficult to perform manual labor, even when they do not possess any anomalously enhanced strength or dexterity.</p><p>SCP-515 was recovered on 12/12/1875 when Foundation personnel discovered an abandoned warehouse in ████ ████████, ██ known for its industrial cast products drug testing pens and gauges. A fire burned out of control for several weeks in the factory before workers noticed that no one was coming in or out of the building. After interviewing residents who lived nearby and reacquiring SCP-515 from a shop owner, it was discovered that SCP-515 had been passing along all of its victims to an unknown source for unknown reasons.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of an interview between Dr. ██████ and SCP-515, conducted on 12/13/1875.</p><p><start transcript></p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Good afternoon, SCP-515.</p><p><strong>SCP-515:</strong> Hey Doc. How\'s it going?</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Not too bad, actually. I have a few questions for you, if you don\'t mind.</p><p><strong>SCP-515:</strong> Sure, sure.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> First question, what is your name?</p><p><strong>SCP-515:</strong> Well, that\'s a funny one, doc. I\'ve never been given a name by anyone. I\'ve been called many things, but they\'re all just nicknames that people use to call me.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> But… surely you must have a name? Something you are called by that isn\'t just a nickname.</p><p>SCP-515 shrugs.</p><p><strong>SCP-515:</strong> I guess it does exist, but no one ever gave it to me. I guess it doesn\'t matter though, because I\'ve never even heard of it before!</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Okay… well then… how did you get stuck in the thumbtack dispenser?</p><p><strong>SCP-515:</strong> Well, that\'s a long story doc. But I\'ll give it to you in a nutshell: I was born into a family of fisher folk who lived near the shore of the Atlantic Ocean. We would go out every year and catch whatever little fish we could find for our home cooking and living rooms for several months out of the year. Some years we would have very good luck catching fish, and others we wouldn\'t be able to catch anything but crabs and kelpies at all.</p><p>One year, things were rough. My parents came to me one day and asked me to stay in the house with them while they went out to fish just a bit away from home. They said they wouldn\'t be more than a few hours away though, so I said okay and waited for them to return. When they came back however, they said that they had caught nothing and hadn\'t caught anything for days. This worried me greatly, because neither of my parents had ever worked in the fishing industry before or known how to catch anything besides their own children and themselves when they were young. So I started to worry about them leaving me alone for so long with no food in the house and no way to get any since most of the other homes were far too far away from ours for us to reach them by foot or horseback. When my parents returned that night however, they seemed fine and happy about their day as if nothing had happened at all except for the lack of fish in their household. They asked me what I thought could be happening to make our home such a mess and told me not to worry about anything because they would fix it all soon enough.</p><p>I didn\'t believe them though until the next day when my parents said they were going out again with their boats this time and wished me luck before leaving me there with their belongings saying they had an important errand to run at some town called "Oceanside". A few hours later when they returned, both my parents seemed happy now but looked tired out like they hadn\'t slept at all instead of sleeping like they usually did after catching fish all day long as they usually did during the summer months when they didn\'t have any work or errands to run at all. Their faces were pale as death with dark circles around their eyes which made them look like ghosts from hell rather than people who were physically from hell itself even though my father was alive and well despite having gone through two nights without sleep at all despite his old age and my mother was still alive despite having gone without sleep for two nights in a row despite her youth. Still exhausted from their lack of sleep though, my parents told me not to worry about them anymore because they had something much more important to do than fishing today which made me worried again but didn\'t make me stop them from leaving which confused me even more since why did something so important need fixing in the first place? Finally understanding why my parents were acting so weird though, I decided to stay home alone until my parents returned by themselves this time taking my belongings into their car along with some supplies I found in their home such as canned food and flashlights for emergencies just in case something happened again when they went out for errands so that I wouldn\'t starve or get hurt anymore than what I already had been getting hurt for two whole days without rest now without my parents there for me at all which worried me even more since my parents didn\'t know how to drive unlike most of the people I knew including myself who learned how to drive on their own when they were young while my parents knew nothing about driving but seemed to know everything else which made me wonder why was something so important happening today when there wasn\'t anything that important being done today? Thinking about everything now though only made me cry even harder knowing that whatever thing was so important might happen again soon even though I was too afraid of what it might be rather than what it might do which made me angry at my parents instead of scared of what might happen which confused me even more now that I was extremely confused instead of feeling scared anymore than what I already felt scared enough already after being left alone with no sleep for two nights now without my parents being there for me at all which if anything being terrifying than what I felt scared enough before about whatever thing being important today making this even worse for me since now instead of feeling sorry for myself because my parents weren\'t there for me anymore when I needed them most as a child should feel instead of feeling terrified as a child should feel now as an adult, I became angry with my parents instead of scared of whatever thing was happening now because this made things worse than embarrassing which confused me even more at how things could possibly get any worse than embarrassing myself by being left alone without sleep for two nights without any kind of help or comfort from anyone but myself now which made me feel even more terrified than what I felt scared enough already because being alone terrified me more than anything else now that being alone was something every human should avoid unless absolutely necessary rather than something every human should accept as normal considering how terrible it feels in reality knowing that this could happen again any time anyone goes out somewhere alone where something may possibly happen which is potentially scary even worse than getting stuck inside a thumbtack dispenser with no way out whatsoever just like how everything else has been horrible enough already but this was definitely one of the worst things which made everything feel like an eternity rather than dramatic which confused me even more since if things continued like this then nothing on Earth could possibly be worse than what was happening now because nothing else could possibly be worse than being left alone without any kind of help or comfort from anyone especially not from my own parents without any sort of plan or idea whatsoever on how to fix whatever thing was going wrong or how to prevent this from happening again which makes this even worse than anything else by itself making everything seem like an eternity rather than dramatic at this point making everything feel like an eternity which makes everything seem like an eternity rather than dramatic which makes everything seem like an eternity rather than dramatic meaning that everything is just going on forever which makes everything seem like an eternity instead of dramatic as if nothing on Earth could possibly be worse than what was happening right now making everything seem like an eternity rather than dramatic making everything seem like an eternity instead of dramatic changing everything forever instead of being done in dramatic fashion instead making everything seem like an eternity rather than dramatic making everything seem like an eternity instead of dramatic making everything seem like an eternity instead of dramatic making everything seem like an eternity instead of dramatic making everything seem like an eternity instead of dramatic making everything seem like an eternity instead of dramatic making everything seem']</p>
