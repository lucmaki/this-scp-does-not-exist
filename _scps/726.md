<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-726</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Containment of SCP-726 is primarily based off of the Foundation's monitoring of human news reports and other social media.</p><p>Although instances of SCP-726 are recognized as spontaneous, a successful Foundation cover story is being developed to explain how it is possible for any social media account to be compromised by a dog or wolf. Any communication directly between an instance of SCP-726 and a human will be intercepted by Foundation personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-726 is a pseudo-anomalous phenomenon affecting human social media profiles. The anomaly appears to be an account created by a dog or wolf that posts video updates and photographs of the subject's life.</p><p>The content of the updates appears to be affected by the subject's mood. If the subject is in a negative or depressed state, SCP-726 will post pictures of mischief, friends and other animals, while in positive states such as happiness, it will post pictures of nature, pets and family. Human subjects have not reported any response from instances of SCP-726 after they have been captured.</p><p>Variants of SCP-726 are currently known to exist. These variants have been named:</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 726-A:</strong> The following is a transcript of an email sent by SCP-726 to Agent ████████ in January of 2018.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> "Today\'s updates"</p><p><strong>Message:</strong> "It’s been a pretty good day, but it’s not over yet. I’ve got two more things I need to do before I go to bed. First up is going to the pet store and getting some t-bone steak for mom. Let’s hope she likes it. She’s never tried it, but she’s been really craving it for the last few weeks and since we don’t have a dog, I figured I’d give her a chance."</p><p><strong>Comments:</strong> SCP-726 appears to be a dog.']</p>
