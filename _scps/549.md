<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-549</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-549 has been divided into two separate zones for containment purposes. All testing of SCP-549 is to be conducted in one zone, Area-15. Areas 15 and 16 are outfitted with surveillance cameras and monitored by an on-site security team. A perimeter fence is to be maintained as well as a containment door. Any civilian that enters Area-15 must wear a helmet with soundproofing at all times, or risk being deafened.</p><p>All items in Area-15 are to be catalogued, inventoried, and readied for the next time SCP-549's anomaly occurs. At the conclusion of testing, test participants will be transferred back to their original locations.</p><p>All individuals who have already entered Zone-15 are to be placed under sedation and amnestics until the next instance of SCP-549 is discovered, at which point they will return from their home locations to Area-15, where they may resume their normal activities.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-549 is an anomalous phenomenon that occurs when a human enters Area-15 of Site-██. No other individuals have been able to enter or communicate with SCP-549 without becoming deafened as well. Only humans have been able to communicate with SCP-549 and its entities.</p><p>The subjects that enter SCP-549 remain depressed and dejected, complaining about how their life has no purpose and that they are incapable of living up to their full potential. The subjects feel strong guilt over not living up to their true ideals and seek out various methods of committing suicide. It is unknown what effect those few who survive suicide attempts experience, as only seven have survived this far in the testing zone.</p><p>Test participants report strange sensations after entering SCP-549, such as numbness, acute tailbone pain, or other intense sensations not usually experienced by humans. Many test subjects report feeling extreme lethargy after exiting SCP-549, but also report having severe headaches for several days afterwards. It is currently unknown whether or not these symptoms are permanent.</p><p>In addition to being unable to communicate with another individual in Zone-15, test subjects can only interact with objects in Zone-15 and never whiteboards, computers, or other devices that allow contact with other people outside of the chamber. Human interaction outside of Zone-15 will not be shown on video surveillance cameras of the room. The security team has discovered that it is possible to communicate with objects in other zones through sound vibrations produced by a device held by the test subject itself; however, it is unclear whether this is due to self-hypnosis or a more supernatural effect.</p><p>As of 09/08/██, no further testing has been scheduled due to security concerns.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 049-A:</strong> The test subjects are being transferred back to their original locations on 09/08/██ at 18:30. All subjects have reported an intense sense of relief and happiness upon returning to their normal lives. One subject in particular, D-5717, has made several suicide attempts leading up to this point, but is now considered to be the most optimistic of all test subjects due to the fact that he can return to his normal life. Due to the nature of SCP-549 and its effect on the test subjects, security personnel are now being stationed in each home where a test subject resides, and are to be contacted directly if they report suicidal tendencies.']</p>
