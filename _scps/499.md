<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-499</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid (see</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-499 is deactivated and kept in a lockbox in the Antique Safe in Site-55's office at all times. All personnel assigned to SCP-499 are required to have been assigned to the Human Resources Department of Site-55 at least 1 year prior to assignment, due to the danger inherent in the object.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-499 is a vintage Parker "Cupid" ballpoint pen, model #92. The object was manufactured in 1947. SCP-499 exhibits no anomalous properties when inactive; however, it can be used to write non-digital messages by placing the ink cartridge back into the pen (SCP-499 will not function if removed from the tube). In any case, this mode of usage will fail if SCP-499 is inserted into a computer, as it will cease all electrical activity at that time. Despite the fact that SCP-499 is completely useless on its own, it is apparently very popular with young children, who write large amounts of "poems" on their bodies or in their play environment using this item.</p><p>Test 499A: D-Class Dory ████████ writes the following message on her left arm:</p><p>"Do you believe in monsters? Do you believe in love? I do."</p><p></p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> After the discovery of SCP-499, Foundation researchers were gifted with a large volume of "poetry" from children. Though most of the writings are not in English, enough of them are written in English to elucidate the following conclusion:</p><p>SCP-499 has the power to make children believe in love. This is best evidenced by the following test:</p><p><strong>Test 499B:</strong> D-Class Dory ████████ writes the following message on her left arm:</p><p>I love you']</p>
