<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-105</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-105 is held in the Site-17 laboratory. SCP-105's containment chamber has a transparent glass window that allows for visual observation; the window acts as a barrier to prevent SCP-105 from moving. The door leading to the chamber can be opened only by personnel and may be locked from the outside with a standard security keypad. No personnel are allowed to enter SCP-105's containment chamber until it is actively under containment.</p><p>Personnel on duty at the Site-17 laboratory are to monitor any occurrences of SCP-105. If a verbal report is deemed necessary, it is to be made immediately; if an incident requires an emergency response, Class-A amnestics are to be administered immediately. Any instances of SCP-105-1 are to be recovered immediately and taken into Foundation custody.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-105 is a desk lamp which emits light over an area of approximately 44 cm. SCP-105's bulb sports a normal shade, which is rectangular in shape with dimensions of 1/72 cm x 1/72 cm. The shade's shape is unique and was never patented; the shade was used for non-marketed lighting fixtures for two decades after its creation.</p><p>SCP-105 can move at anywhere from roughly 0.01 to 0.1 meters per second. It does this by moving along the horizontal axis of its hinge until one of its "legs" touches the ground, when it will remain stationary for as long as necessary to hold its position. If a human attempts to touch SCP-105 while in motion, they will be subject to severe pain and muscle spasms. This pain is not apparent to human eyes; the only way anyone has seen the "foot" that contacts the ground is when SCP-105 stops moving, and even then it is only noticeable by close proximity. From observation and research into SCP-105's properties, it appears that all instances of SCP-105 are identical and have no limit in size; however, this has not been confirmed by physical examination of instances or testing equipment capable of accurately measuring size.</p><p>SCP-105 will emit a beam within three seconds after one leg touches the ground; this beam appears to have no limits in power or direction and penetrates through any object or person before leaving the object or person completely unharmed, although those hit directly by the beam will experience severe pain from both contact with the heat and pressure from the energy required to project such a powerful image.</p><p>SCP-105's "feet" are resistant to damage caused by normal friction such as handprints on glass or normal wear and tear, although testing on this has shown that it does not continue indefinitely; this resistance allows it to travel much farther than what would be expected based on initial velocity.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 105-1:</strong></p><p>SCP-105's location was discovered by Dr. █████, who had just returned to work after a two-week vacation and needed to quickly find a replacement light bulb for SCP-███. While searching the area behind SCP-105, Dr. █████ accidentally knocked into the table lamp and saw an image of his colleague, Dr. ██████, overlaid on the lamp's shade. After contacting Dr. ██████, Dr. █████ realized that he had been inadvertently watching SCP-105 for over 15 minutes.</p><p>Dr. █████ reported this to Dr. ███████, who then ordered SCP-105 contained immediately. SCP-105 was contained in Site-17's containment chamber with the aid of a remote control device devised by Dr. ████████████, with the assistance of several other members of the staff.</p><p>On May 22nd, ████, SCP-105's containment chamber was found unmanned after security personnel noticed the light seeming dimmer than normal; upon investigation, it was discovered that a portion of the ceiling had collapsed behind SCP-105, causing a large hole, 1\xa0m x 8\xa0m in size, to be revealed. The hole contained a large mass of what appeared to be white cotton (currently unidentified as to source), which had been pushed through the hole and into the containment chamber itself. Upon further investigation, Foundation personnel discovered that the mass was composed of cotton fibers from at least five different cotton plants; this was quickly confirmed by DNA profiling and confirmed to be non-anomalous cotton by genetic testing.</p><p>SCP-105 itself remained unharmed during this incident. Its anomalous properties were not detected by any form of detector until the mass's appearance in its containment chamber."]</p>
