<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-412</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-412 is to be contained inside a 5m x 3m Secure-Containment Cell. SCP-412 must be fed a constant supply of organic matter from the research team. SCP-412 does not require food and minimal sustenance, however the containment staff must maintain a supply of non-sentient organic matter for around two weeks. The facility containing SCP-412 must be kept at a temperature of 68 °F. The room must be equipped with a heating system, fans and air conditioner units with no direct openings on the ceiling above the chamber.</p><p>All personnel working in or near SCP-412 must wear protective bodysuits and retain respiratory protection when inside the chamber. Breaches in containment are to be quickly sealed and medical staff brought in to assist any personnel affected by SCP-412. No human subjects are to be exposed to SCP-412 without prior written permission from an agent of level 3 clearance or higher, except during approved testing procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-412 is a humanoid entity with a head resembling that of an African elephant, large ears and a purple circular, nictitating membrane. SCP-412 is capable of vocalization, but its speech is unintelligible to humans. It appears to be sapient and follows a logical order to all subjects introduced to it. Testing has revealed that it remembers events outside testing procedures, but cannot retain details beyond one week after meeting the individual with whom it has interacted. This defect makes testing difficult in cases where more than one subject is present at the same time as SCP-412; however, this limitation does not apply in testing involving only one human subject, where it can accurately identify the person over periods exceeding one year.</p><p>SCP-412 absorbs the memories and personality of those who interact with it during testing, which causes severe changes in the behavior of personnel. Subjects exhibit signs of extreme distress when their memorized personalities are taken over by SCP-412. When a subject's memories are no longer needed for research purposes or for an indefinite period of time following exposure to SCP-412, SCP-412 will immediately leave the subject's body and return to its containment chamber.</p><p>Individuals exposed to SCP-412 report experiencing intense emotions during interaction with SCP-412 that do not respond to commonly used psychological tests and treatments. Following exposure to SCP-412, subjects have difficulty performing tasks requiring concentration or cooperation (including physical tasks such as driving vehicles) and have difficulty distinguishing what is real and what is imagined.</p><p>SCP-412 was initially discovered in ██████, France after reports began coming in from local police forces suggesting that several individuals had either been killed or found missing while on police duty inside a store in the city. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate suspected homicide/suicide incidents linked to what became known as "Afroclown" incidents. The individual responsible for most of these crimes was identified as Edgar ████████ (DOB: ██/██/1955), who was apprehended and detained by Foundation agents on 05/27/1973 after attempts at escaping custody led him into contact with low level MTF members assigned for trivial containment purposes; he was amnesticized after questioning regarding his actions.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 412-A:</strong> SCP-412 was discovered in ████, France after reports from local police forces indicated that several traffic accidents and suicides had taken place in the city. Foundation agents were dispatched to investigate the cause of these incidents. The individual responsible for the majority of these crimes was identified as Edgar ████████ and detained on 05/27/1973, amnestics were administered to staff and civilians present during the arrest. Edgar was sent to Site-19 where he was administered amnestics, given a medical examination and assigned to a cell block in Unit-14.</p><p>When Edgar was questioned concerning his actions, he claimed to have started performing "funny songs" in his cell. This behavior continued at regular intervals for three months until it was noticed by guards on duty. Edgar was transferred to a different cell block with stricter security measures; this change in environment caused him to stop singing and he began exhibiting symptoms similar to those of dementia and extreme depression, which eventually led to his suicide on 07/22/1974.']</p>
