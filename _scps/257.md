<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-257</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-257 is to be kept in standard containment locker 223 at Site-77, with the exception of testing. All staff have been given a detailed briefing on SCP-257's effects as well as its general nature.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-257 is a black glass bottle containing a yellow liquid. Upon opening, the liquid turns to an acid and burns through any material on its path. The distribution of SCP-257's properties are as follows:</p><p>The liquid's burning nature is enough to cover anything within a two-meter radius in flames for up to 2600 cm. The fire it creates will not be extinguished by any other means but the liquid itself.</p><p>SCP-257 was found in ███████, Texas on June 7th, 1976 following the disappearance of [REDACTED]. Initial testing upon SCP-257 revealed that its melting and burning effects would statistically increase in severity with increased mass and density of an object. Testing thus indicates that SCP-257's effects change depending on the target object's structure.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-257\'s cause of disappearance was found to be an [REDACTED] in the ████ ██████ █████ newspaper. The [REDACTED] was found to be an advertisement for a "relocation promotion", which offered a one dollar reward to any individual who submitted a written letter claiming that their home was too small for them and that they would be willing to move.']</p>
