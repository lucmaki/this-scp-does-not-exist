<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-95</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-95 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Bio-Site-17. It is currently not under any sort of security protocol, but this is to change in the near future. SCP-95's cell chamber is to be checked daily for any signs of damage and or tampering. SCP-95's food is to be watered down to prevent corrosion, as well as its water must be tested regularly and replaced as needed. Any type of metal or other metallic object is to be removed before entering SCP-95's cell chamber at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-95 is a female human, 34 years of age. It is capable of speaking fluently in English and Russian, but has displayed no other linguistic learning. Its skin has been reported to be extremely cold, averaging 50 degrees Fahrenheit below what an average human body temperature would be. While SCP-95's anomalous properties have not manifested themselves in tests with non-humanoids, it is still advised that this subject be avoided by all non-humans due to its highly corrosive properties towards anything not made out of metal or some similar material.</p><p>SCP-95's primary anomalous effect is its extreme resistance to corrosion. Any metallic object placed in contact with SCP-95 will instantaneously begin to corrode at an extremely rapid rate, resulting in a breakdown of the material into smaller and smaller pieces unless such an object is removed from SCP-95's presence. This effect will not occur if the metallic object is completely covered by SCP-95 at the time of exposure. The corrosion will continue regardless of the location of the metallic object (not restricted to physical contact) and does not seem to be affected by any "shielding", such as surrounding stone or walls made from reinforced concrete or titanium. If SCP-95 is no longer available for an object to corrode, it will rapidly decompose back into its original form at which point, it will become inert and useless for any further use until replaced by a new object prior to SCP-95's next remanifestation.</p><p>SCP-95 was first contained on ██/██/████ at a shopping mall in ████████ when it caused damage to the majority of the mall after attempting to escape containment due to its containment being accidentally breached. SCP-95 was contained again shortly thereafter and held at Bio-Site 17, where it was treated and studied by researchers in order to determine its anomalous properties.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-95's current containment procedures have been effective for the past year, but it has still managed to escape containment at least four times. Each time this happens, the process is rather fast:</p><p>1.) SCP-95 breaks through its reinforced concrete cell and makes its way to the front of the mall at which point it begins to corrode any metallic object it can get a hold of.</p><p>2.) SCP-95 keeps itself hidden under or behind a row of concrete pillars in the middle of the mall.</p><p>3.) SCP-95 makes its way back to its cell chamber, where it continues to corrode anything metallic in the chamber.</p><p>4.) A security guard rushes inside the mall and makes it to the cell chamber at which point SCP-95 begins to corrode him non-anomalously.</p><p>5.) The security guard, who by now has become completely inert due to corrosion, falls to the ground and struggles to move as he is slowly dissolved into a pile of dust.</p><p>6.) SCP-95 escapes containment again, but this time it was around midnight. The next day all of the mall's metal surfaces had severely corroded themselves until they were no longer usable. These surfaces were then replaced with reinforced concrete."]</p>
