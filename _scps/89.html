<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-89 and its containment building are to be kept in a secure, locked facility. All personnel entering the facility must pass through a metal detector and register at the reception desk. The lobby is to be barred with solid metal doors.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-89 is a containment building located at the former location of the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. SCP-89 originally contained five humanoid anomalies, one of which was designated SCP-89-1. SCP-89's interior has been extensively remodeled to accommodate both its anomalous properties and its new residents.</p><p>SCP-89 was used by Walt Disney as a place to record short films for his use by his company. After Disney's death, the facility was sold to the City of Burbank which renovated it into a studio sound stage (hence the name "Burbank Soundstage") for film and television production. SCP-89 currently holds two humanoid anomalies designated SCP-89-2 and 89-3, who are currently being studied on site.</p><p>The following is a list of notable visits to 90:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 89-01:</strong> On 09/10/1995, SCP-89 was purchased by the Foundation. The Foundation has used it as a Containment Site for the past ten years.</p>
