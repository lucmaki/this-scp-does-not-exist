<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-461</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-461 is currently being stored in a secure vault at Site-██. SCP-461 is to be maintained at ambient temperature of 27 °C, and any external sources of heat are to be avoided.</p><p>No physical contact with SCP-461 is permitted. Any personnel that have touched SCP-461 since the creation of containment procedures are to be quarantined for the duration of their contact with SCP-461.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-461 is a human male of approximately 70 years of age, with dark brown hair and an olive complexion. SCP-461's hair is unkempt, and he has yet to apply any kind of cosmetic preparation.</p><p>SCP-461 has no obvious deformities or physical defects, aside from being blind. However, when in contact with human subjects (as far as is possible), SCP-461 exhibits sensory functions that are consistent with an ordinary human male in the prime of life. When in temperatures where human subjects would normally experience pain sensations throughout their bodies, SCP-461 experiences neither pain nor discomfort.</p><p>SCP-461 claims that his name is ██████ ████, and that he resides in [REDACTED]. The Foundation does not possess any evidence of this information being true; however, its veracity is irrelevant to containment procedures.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-461 was originally contained at [REDACTED], where it was recovered from the home of ██████ ████. Mr. ████ had died from [REDACTED], but his family believes that he was murdered (see Interview 461-01).</p><p>Mr. ████'s son, ██████ ████, has been interviewed.</p><p><strong>Interview 461-01:</strong></p><p>Interviewer: Agent ███████</p><p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Agent ███████ interviewed the subject on ██/██/2002 after the subject's death. The subject had been dead for approximately two months before this interview.</p><p><Begin Log></p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, Mr. ████. I know this must be difficult for you.</p><p><strong>Mr. ████:</strong> Hey, it's not like I've got anything better to do.</p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> I can't tell you how sorry we are about your father.</p><p><strong>Mr. ████:</strong> Yeah, well, what're you gonna do? He's been dead for a while now. It was bound to happen eventually.</p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> It's just that we don't have any leads at this time regarding his death. We're hoping you might be able to help us out somehow.</p><p><strong>Mr. ████:</strong> What do I get out of it? This is gonna cost me my allowance, isn't it?</p><p><strong>Agent ███████:</strong> No, we'll make sure you're not penalized in any way for cooperating with us in this matter. Just answer our questions as truthfully as possible and we'll be on our way.</p><p><strong>Mr. ████:</strong> Okay then… let's get to it then.</p><p><End Log></p><p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Mr. ████ has been placed in temporary containment pending Foundation administration of amnestics.</p>
