<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-398</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-398 is kept in a standard containment cell at Site-17 for testing. Movement is to be restricted to no more than one meter per minute.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-398 is a child's blanket. It has no anomalous properties aside from the fact that it is constantly in motion, as if being carried by a wind current.</p><p>When SCP-398 is not moving, it will move counterclockwise around its center of mass at a rate of approximately 0.15 m/s, modulating in speed constantly between these two speeds (the average speed has not been measured).</p><p>The pattern of movement produces one of three distinct floral designs with each rotation:</p><p>If SCP-398 is exposed to even a little bit of friction, the pattern immediately changes to either "snail" or "worm".</p><p>SCP-398 was originally found on ██████ ██████, SCP-398's original manufacturer and where SCP-398 had apparently resided in ██████ for the previous twelve years. A family named ████████ had found it during one of their infrequent cleaning sessions; no information concerning them could be located. The blanket was then given to Dr. ████████ by Agent ███████ shortly after she reported developing an unexplained compulsion to purchase items with floral patterns on them.</p><p>History: Ongoing tests are required to determine whether SCP-398 exhibits any anomalous properties when unencumbered with its movement pattern changing mechanism. However, all tests have shown that SCP-398 retains complete control over the speed and direction of its movement without any outside influence. Testing is currently suspended pending further research.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 398-1:</strong> On ██/██/██, a test was conducted to test the effects of SCP-398's anomalous properties on subjects with a sensory deficit. Subjects were administered a single drop of sterile saline into their left eye while they held SCP-398 in their right hand. Subjects were then allowed to take SCP-398 from their hand with their eyes closed and continue holding it, still with their eyes closed. The results are as follows:</p><p><strong>0-19 seconds:</strong> No reaction.</p><p><strong>20-39 seconds:</strong> Subjects experience mild discomfort in their eyes.</p><p><strong>40-59 seconds:</strong> Subjects report feeling an uncomfortable pressure along their visual nerves.</p><p><strong>60-89 seconds:</strong> Subjects report severe pain and nausea, resulting in involuntary eye contact with SCP-398. The source of the pain is unknown, and attempts to test its effects have revealed no difference between normal and blind subjects.</p><p><strong>90-100 seconds:</strong> Subjects can no longer open their eyes due to extreme pain and express fear of blindness."]</p>
