<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-16</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-16 is to be maintained within a standard containment locker. SCP-16's hull is to be cleaned once each week with a cleaning solution such as mineral oil.</p><p>Every 8 days, SCP-16 is to be checked to ensure that the waterproofing membrane inside the bell is functioning properly. Any leaks that occur are to be sealed using duct tape and waterproof glue. If leaks continue, SCP-16 is to be inspected visually for any damage that may have occurred to SCP-16 (if any) and repaired as necessary.</p><p>SCP-16's propeller must be inspected every 6 weeks for damage. In the event of damage, SCP-16 must return to the Foundation for repair.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-16 is a wooden sailing ship that was built in the late 18th century. SCP-16's interior is in poor condition, and there are traces of black powder near the cannons. SCP-16 is missing a roughly 10 character name in large, faded letters on both sides of the ship. SCP-16 has four cannons that can fire cannonballs at speeds of up to 1km/h.</p><p>If the sails attached to SCP-16 are unfurled, it will be able to travel at an average speed of 10km/h. To unfurl the sails, one must pull on a rope located near the bow of the ship. The ropes are made of a spider web type material that allows them to be stretched out, but not pulled back. If any part of SCP-16 (including its hull) touches water while under sail, it will continue moving forward indefinitely until a sailing rope becomes exhausted or loses tension.</p><p>SCP-16 was recovered from ███████ Harbor, ██ after reports were reported by local civilians of an unknown ship being "sailing" through the harbor. Local authorities were unable to track down any witnesses due to the boat having disappeared before they arrived on scene. The ship was found to be carrying one living human body along with several pieces of clothing, a box containing assorted items such as photos and letters, and what appeared to be approximately 400 bottles of whiskey and wine.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum SCP-16-A:</strong> SCP-16 was found floating in ███████ Harbor after local authorities had failed to find any witnesses to the anomalous ship. The body found inside SCP-16 was estimated to be approximately 30 years old and had been dead for approximately 18 months. The body was encased in a wooden box, with a large block of wood covering the top half of the body. The top of the box was tied shut with ropes, and was left open for about 6 months without the body being disturbed.</p><p>Upon examination of the body, no cause of death could be found, but several bottles of alcohol were found nearby, suggesting that the person died from alcohol poisoning.</p><p>The body was clothed in a large coat along with a pair of pants that were described as "clothing from the 1800\'s". The man\'s eyes were covered by large wood blocks, similar to those used on coffins at the time of his death.</p>
