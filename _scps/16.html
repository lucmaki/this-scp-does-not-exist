<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-16</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-16 is to be maintained within a standard containment locker. SCP-16's hull is to be cleaned once each week with a cleaning solution such as mineral oil.</p><p>Every 8 days, SCP-16 is to be checked to ensure that the waterproofing membrane inside the bell is functioning properly. Any leaks that occur are to be sealed using duct tape and waterproof glue. If leaks continue, SCP-16 is to be inspected visually for any damage that may have occurred to SCP-16 (if any) and repaired as necessary.</p><p>SCP-16's propeller must be inspected every 6 weeks for damage. In the event of damage, SCP-16 must return to the Foundation for repair.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-16 is a wooden sailing ship that was built in the late 18th century. SCP-16's interior is in poor condition, and there are traces of black powder near the cannons. SCP-16 is missing a roughly 10 character name in large, faded letters on both sides of the ship. SCP-16 has four cannons that can fire cannonballs at speeds of up to 1km/h.</p><p>If the sails attached to SCP-16 are unfurled, it will be able to travel at an average speed of 10km/h. To unfurl the sails, one must pull on a rope located near the bow of the ship. The ropes are made of a spider web type material that allows them to be stretched out, but not pulled back. If any part of SCP-16 (including its hull) touches water while under sail, it will continue moving forward indefinitely until a sailing rope becomes exhausted or loses tension.</p><p>SCP-16 was recovered from ███████ Harbor, ██ after reports were reported by local civilians of an unknown ship being "sailing" through the harbor. Local authorities were unable to track down any witnesses due to the boat having disappeared before they arrived on scene. The ship was found to be carrying one living human body along with several pieces of clothing, a box containing assorted items such as photos and letters, and what appeared to be approximately 400 bottles of whiskey and wine.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
