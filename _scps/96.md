<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-96</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-96 is secured in a standard containment locker at Site-23. A heating pad is to be provided to SCP-96 during the night.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-96 is a medium-sized dog, approximately six years old and weighing 76 kg. SCP-96 is able to use its body to generate extremely high temperatures. No known material or method of insulation has been able to stop SCP-96 from being capable of sustaining temperatures in excess of 1,100 C. SCP-96 appears to have a preference for mainly warm and/or damp areas, which are typically located in or around the confines of large buildings such as hotels and office complexes.</p><p>SCP-96’s preferred manner of movement while in containment is bipedal with an average speed of 7 km/h. SCP-96 is only capable of maintaining a sustained temperature of 1000 C when moving at this speed, and will cease after 3 minutes if not stopped. SCP-96 is incapable of sustaining this temperature indefinitely in its current containment environment, requiring extra heating equipment to be provided on a daily basis.</p><p>When SCP-96 enters a relatively warm building, it will begin walking across the interior until it reaches an area that it regards as suitable for its needs; usually, this involves a number of rooms off the main hallway such as guest bedrooms or employee lounge spaces. Once satisfied with its surroundings, SCP-96 will begin pacing back and forth inside the room repeatedly walking away from (and then back towards) the door in search for more suitable spaces to move around in for extended periods of time. This behavior can result in damage to both the interior and exterior of the building if not properly contained.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-96 was initially contained in a small, cramped containment cell at Site-23. SCP-96’s containment had the following notable features:</p><p>Despite the above conditions, SCP-96 was capable of maintaining a temperature of 1,200 C during its containment. As a result, SCP-96 was euthanized and incinerated by the on-site fire department. Reports indicate that SCP-96 was provided with a heating pad as well as a thermometer to monitor its heat levels.</p><p>Since the above incident, an additional containment locker has been constructed at Site-23 specifically for SCP-96. The new locker contains a heating pad and thermometer, as well as an extra layer of insulation to prevent any damage to the building in the instance of an extended period of high temperature.</p><p><strong>Incident Report 96/12:</strong> On ██/██/1996, an employee at Site-23 reported noticing one of the walls in a bathroom being unusually warm for approximately one hour. After this period of time, the temperature dropped to normal levels and the wall appeared to be undamaged. A follow up investigation determined that SCP-96 had entered the bathroom and was using it as a makeshift sleeping area.']</p>
