<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-166</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The artifact is to be guarded under constant video surveillance at Site-64. All research on the artifact is to be carried out through Site-64's legitimate library, which is to be completely separate from the artifact itself. The staff of Site-64 are to be given class C amnestics upon entering the containment wing of SCP-166. Any personnel who leave Site-66 and enter a Foundation Site are to be considered as having been captured by SCP-166.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-166 is an artifact with the appearance of a 33 cm x 24 cm photograph. The back of the paper is blank, but the front bears various logos, all of which appear to be connected to a company named APS Photo. SCP-166's anomalous effects become active when it is placed in a camera.</p><p>SCP-166 will then activate its anomalous effect to slowly change the images displayed from that picture. Initially, this will begin with very minor changes, such as straightening of perspective or slight additions or removals of objects from the background. As time progresses and more people come into contact with the picture, these changes will become increasingly severe. For example, a person who looks at the image will begin to see their head dissolving and separating into individual particles, while a second would see the particles taking on human proportions. This effect will continue until something takes place with the picture, such as disposing of it.</p><p>If SCP-166 is taken directly from camera to camera instead of being kept in storage, it will also gradually change its appearance over time. However, if any other object is placed into the photo itself before taking it away again (such as holding it up to another camera), SCP-166's ability to change photographs ceases entirely. Attempts have been made to take a photo of SCP-166 itself; however, this appears to have no discernible effect on the object itself.</p><p>SCP-166 was discovered by Agent ████ after he observed two male subjects approaching his office during an investigation into anomalies occurring within Site-66 for several hours without leaving. Upon questioning them about their whereabouts, they had no memory of their behavior and claimed that they were not aware that SCP-166 had been there for some time despite having been working on it. Agent ████ managed to secure a copy of SCP-166 from them and later reported this artifact along with others found related to SCP-972 and SCP-173 to Dr Januszpork1 at Site-64 through Headquarters Security Department 5 ("HSD").</p><p></p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 166:</strong> Incident 166-1</p><p>On ██/██/20██, Agent [REDACTED] was assigned to SCP-166's containment wing as part of a routine security force rotation. This was the first time that any of the site staff had been allowed to enter the wing; however, due to the nature of their duties and the fact that they were not in contact with the artifact itself, they were unaware of its existence.</p><p>When Agent [REDACTED] went to take his meal break, he observed two figures observing him from within a large box in the back of SCP-166. He then returned to his station and ate his meal, but upon returning to his office he found that it had been replaced with a picture of himself playing a violin. Upon inspecting the picture, he realized that it was changing as he watched. After approximately 15 minutes of observation, Agent [REDACTED] was able to determine that the figure in the picture was slowly becoming two separate entities, one male and one female. Agent [REDACTED] then left the containment wing and reported this incident to Dr Januszpork1."]</p>
