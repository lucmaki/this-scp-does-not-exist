<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-335</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Containment is being maintained at the closest available Foundation site. The facility itself is codenamed "The Well", and has been constructed as a means of containing SCP-335. Amy can be contained by use of a soundproofed containment chamber, and SCP-335 should be contained in a separate cell.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-335 is a decaying humanoid corpse with a torso, legs and arms present. The forearms are missing, though SCP-335 retains SCP-339 in their place. Several publications list SCP-335 as being male; at the time of its discovery this was incorrect. No other remains have been identified.</p><p>The first time SCP-335's anomaly was observed, it kept repeating the phrase "I've got bad news" over and over again to any individual who observed it. This behavior continued even after the Foundation took control of its containment. The only way to stop this is by killing SCP-335, or removing its anomalous properties permanently via destruction.</p><p>SCP-335 is hostile toward Foundation personnel, regardless of age and gender, and will attempt to attack them on sight. Should SCP-335 be killed, it will reanimate within 48 hours; three full days of dormancy must elapse before it attempts to reanimate again. This process can be sped up with the use of properly treated amnestics .</p><p>Should SCP-335 reach an age in which it will not be able to reanimate due to denaturation, a process that would normally take roughly 35 years, the anomalous properties of SCP-335 will instead activate once every 2.5 years for a period of 5 years. This is currently ongoing.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> The following is a transcript of a conversation between Dr. ██████, who originally discovered SCP-335, and one of his research assistants.</p><p><strong>Assistant:</strong> What\'s the deal with you and that thing? Every time I come in here you\'re talking to it like it\'s your best friend.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> How would you describe it?</p><p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Well, it\'s not human, but it\'s missing some parts and all of its body feels kind of… weird.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> I can\'t really say. I don\'t really know what it is.</p><p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Oh, well, don\'t worry about it. I mean, it can\'t hurt you or anything. It sounds like the type of thing that likes to talk to itself anyway.</p><p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> Alright, good point.</p><p>The next day Assistant ██████ was found dead in front of SCP-335\'s containment chamber with several stab wounds to the torso and legs. Autopsy revealed that she had been stabbed in the neck and chest areas, presumably by a small knife made of bone. Dr. ██████ reported to security personnel at the scene that he had been "talking" with SCP-335 shortly before assistant ██████\'s death; the remains of this "conversation" were found on a nearby table, along with a hastily scribbled note reading simply "I HATE YOU".</p>
