<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-626</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-626 is currently contained within an anomalous sphere in Sector-PENTAH, a containment bay at Site-46. Exposed materials from SCP-626 and its chamber are to be stored within standard anomalous containment containers.</p><p>Any personnel entering Sector-PENTAH require clearance from at least one member of the research staff. Any personnel approaching SCP-626 without clearance should be detained, with the potential for amnestic treatment if deemed necessary.</p><p>All detections of SCP-626 have been classified as MTF Epsilon-23 ("Wormhole"), tasked with locating the anomaly's vicinity and documenting any changes.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-626 is a black hole, apparently located within Sector-PENTAH of Site-46. The space around SCP-626 is filled with a dense plasma field, which is likely a result of the black hole's extremely high gravitation.</p><p>SCP-626's presence causes an anomalous bulk flow in the plasma field, with the center of the mass being displaced along the direction of said flow. This displacement periodically saturates faster than expected: approximately once every hour, the center of the mass will "uncoil" to a distance of 13 km (8.1 mi) away from its position currently occupied by 52600m/s; it has been hypothesized that this may be caused by SCP-626's gravitational pull on any objects nearby.</p><p>At this distance, 52600m/s undergoes what appears to be massive acceleration and deceleration; however, no visible changes have been recorded over detected accelerations and decelerations. After an unknown amount of time (within two weeks), 52600m/s returns to its original position.</p><p>Scanning equipment is not capable of detecting these "undetected" events; testing was discontinued due to budget cuts, but is still able to locate the area around SCP-626.</p><p>The existence of this event is inconsistent; scans indicate it takes place at irregular intervals, but measurements taken from personnel approaching or entering Sector-PENTAH are consistent with previous observations.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
