<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-545</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-545 has been stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber. The chamber itself is located in the Secure Containment Wing of Site-28.</p><p>A standard Foundation guard force is to be assigned to SCP-545, for security purposes as well as for routine maintenance and cleaning of the chamber.</p><p>No individuals are to enter the chamber other than with prior permission from Dr. Hopkinsness, Senior Researcher of Site-28.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-545 is an adult male humanoid, approximately 2.5 m in height and weighting 100 kg. The subject wears a white beard, and has a voice that sounds like a muted version of [DATA EXPUNGED].</p><p>The subject appears to possess a rudimentary form of sapience, with limited linguistic skills. When questioned about the nature of this sapience, SCP-545 will respond with voiceless gibberish, although SCP-545 will respond to questions in Russian or Modern English. At least one researcher has observed that SCP-545 will attempt to communicate in two different languages simultaneously, and will do so for some time.</p><p>The subject does not appear to require sustenance, nor does it seem affected by gravity. However, it has been noted that SCP-545 experiences mild headaches when wearing eyeglasses.</p><p>Discovery: SCP-545 was discovered at a local church in the rural town of [REDACTED] in Russia. Two elderly women reported hearing crying and moaning coming from the basement of the building. During a search of the building they found the body of [DATA REDACTED], who was later confirmed to be deceased upon autopsy. A search of the area surrounding the building revealed three other bodies, all believed to have been deceased for at least five years. All four corpses were located within a small stone box at the center of the room. Examination of the area around the box showed no traces of blood, leading researchers to believe that these corpses had been embalmed after death rather than being buried at all.</p><p>The bodies were all young men and women, who were dressed in clothing consistent with their respective ages; however, there was no sign of any wounds on them consistent with their supposed cause of death. As such, it is unknown how they were entombed or if they even were entombed at all; however, one body did show signs of having been beaten severely before being placed in its final resting place.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> After the discovery of SCP-545, the church was officially condemned as a hazard and underwent extensive cleanup. However, the local authorities determined that the cause of death in all four corpses was not consistent with any known disease. In light of this, the local authorities claimed that the bodies were "unidentified" and requested that the Foundation take custody of all four of them.']</p>
