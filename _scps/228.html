<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-228</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-228 is stored in a standard containment locker at Site-66. There is to be no attempt to examine SCP-228 while it is inactive and no personnel are to attempt conversation with the creature without being accompanied by a Level 3 or higher security member.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-228 is an audio cassette tape measuring 10.5 cm by 5.4 cm and labeled "B.R.B." The object plays only one track, which is the song "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine" from the original 1966 album "Abbey Road", by The Beatles. SCP-228 was found in a box at the singer Paul McCartney's residence on 29 September 1974. No more cassettes were found and it is presumed SCP-228 was ████th of a full album, as it took only two weeks to record (and three months to produce).</p><p>The image of SCP-228 shows that there are two additional cassettes inside; the third track, part of the song "Here Comes The Sun", is not present. There is also an image of a triceratops on the front cover, wearing sunglasses and holding a baseball bat with its right forefoot. No information is given except for maybe being a dinosaur and potentially loving music.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On 19 February 1978, SCP-228 was found playing the song "The Love Song of a Dead Triceratops" by The Monkees. Only one track was played before the cassette became impossible to access.']</p>
