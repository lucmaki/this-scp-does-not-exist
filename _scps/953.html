<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-953</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-953 is to be stored in a standard humanoid containment chamber. See SCPs:97, 385, 765, 866, and 994 for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-953 is an adult male member of the Homo sapiens species. The subject, originally named ████████ ███████, was taken into Foundation custody on ██/██/20██ in █████████, South Dakota.</p><p>SCP-953 displays a number of anomalous properties:</p><p>SCP-953 will identify itself as "Dave", or "Davison". When questioned about this, it is determined that the object does not recall any past lives prior to its current existence. Further tests have shown that SCP-953 can reproduce information by using its power to brainwash others into believing that it is a human being. Currently, SCP-953 has been able to convince at least 31 individuals to believe it to be human, including family members and friends.</p><p>SCP-953 has the ability to change its appearance at will. This is usually accomplished through the use of a suit of power armor composed of various metals, which SCP-953 calls "Dave's Ultimate Body Armor". The armor appears to have been constructed from scrap parts of vehicles and buildings. The armor creates a shell around its wearer, covering every part of the body except for head, arms, legs, and hands. The armor has two different options for function:</p><p>The armor functions as a complete body; SCP-953 can perform all physical acts normally done with the human body.</p><p>SCP-953's life cycle begins when it enters a new host body. Upon entering the new host body, SCP-953 will utilize its ability to alter its form and take on a humanoid appearance and form the host body's personality. Of note is that SCP-953 requires relatively little effort in order to obtain new bodies. If another suitable host body is present within 100 meters, SCP-953's power will activate and attach itself to that body via unknown means (See Addendum). Once attached to the new host body, SCP-953 will take over control of the body - it is unable to maintain control unless another individual remains alive within 100 meters.</p><p>When outside of an active host body, SCP-953 will create several pieces of technology for use in combat purposes or as guards for itself. These devices are typically made from scrap metal or other materials found in the area where it was discovered (see Addendum). It is not yet known how SCP-953 acquires these materials. When not in use as protection or guard duty, these devices are stored inside an iron box which serves as its container. As well as the device storing SCP-953 itself, this box also contains several other important documents related to its history and containment procedures (See Addendum).</p>
