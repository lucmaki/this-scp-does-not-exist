<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-670</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Containment Grade Fire</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-670 is to be treated as a civilian object and kept in high-security storage. Personnel are to restrict access to testing and Site-17 personnel are not to handle or manipulate any component of SCP-670. All experiment logs for SCP-670 must be reviewed by a member of research staff before the logs are permanently archived. Any component of SCP-670 which is taken from storage for testing must be returned inside of 24 hours, or the subject will become Containment Breach grade and must be terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-670 is a folding Japanese-style tea room table, measuring approximately 50cm x 80cm. The table is comprised of an assortment of variously sized wooden boards and slats which appear to be made out of birch wood. There are four legs at each corner of the table; these also show signs of crude carving in the shape of human hands. Two handtracks extend from the ends on each side, curving upwards and ending at points on the underside of the table.</p><p>SCP-670's anomalous effect manifests once any subject sitting upon it has been completely absorbed into its interior; SCP-670 itself remains unaffected by this effect. All internal components of SCP-670 will change and rearrange themselves to accommodate any subject which is sitting upon it; for example, a human subject sitting upon SCP-670 will cause it to shift around as necessary to make enough space for them to sit down. When an object is completely no longer occupying space inside of SCP-670, whatever has left will be ejected onto a nearby surface at an average speed of 1Â m/s. In the majority of cases, when an occupant sits down SCP-670 will change itself to more comfortably accommodate this event. This occurs regardless of whether the occupant is human or not.</p><p>When any group of nonhuman entities tries to use SCP-670 together, they are transported instantly to a single point in time; either before they attempted to sit down onto SCP-670, or as soon as they had finished sitting down, but not beyond. When a group containing more than one type of nonhuman entity such as, for example, multiple humanoids and a large insect individual, attempt to use SCP-670 together, they will be split up and no longer be able to interact with each other.</p><p>In addition to transporting subjects instantaneously outside [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP-670 has the ability to animate objects inside it and cause them to actively move within its interior by animating instances embedded within them. This effect can be observed when an object is removed from SCP-670 while still being animated by it; in these cases standard containment procedures are sufficient to contain instances still within the affected object before it can escape SCP-670's containment. However, if an instance is animated within an object when that object is removed from SCP-670's interior then only the animation will escape along with the object - previously contained instances remain stationary inside SCP- 670 until reanimation by SCP-670 occurs again.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Experiment Log 670-01</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> D-9477</p><p><strong>Object:</strong> Three (3) wooden chalkboards</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Subject D-9477 is instructed to use a tool to carve the following message into one of the boards:</p><p>"A body is but an empty vehicle for a soul - and where there\'s no soul, there\'s no reason to live. For we are made by God, and God will decide what happens to you."</p><p>D-9477 is then told to place their hand upon the other two boards and use them in place of a table. After approximately 5 minutes, all three boards show signs of having been animated. A single humanoid is visible on each board, and they begin to walk toward the center of the room. After approximately 15 minutes, all three boards have become fully animate, and they stand in a line, facing away from the subject. In addition, a large number of smaller humanoid figures can be seen inside of each board. The humanoid figures look like they are made out of wood and appear to be dressed in variously colored garments. No other features or limbs can be seen on these figures.</p><p>After approximately 30 minutes, D-9477 attempts to remove one of the boards from SCP-670\'s interior; however, after about 20 seconds the entire area surrounding the board completely fills with wood which then leaves it as an instance of SCP-670-1. This instance immediately turns around and walks back towards D-9477; it then stops in front of the subject and remains stationary. The humanoid figure then kneels down onto its knees and begins holding a fist up towards its chest while continuously chanting in a low tone:</p><p>"The flesh is nothing more than dead meat - serve my will."</p><p>When D-9477 attempts to leave SCP-670\'s interior, the humanoid figure stands up again and raises both arms up towards the ceiling; its arms suddenly begin to change shape and grow hair without any visible source for said growth. Its arms then reach out towards D-9477 and grab hold of his wrists before transporting him back into SCP-670\'s interior.']</p>
