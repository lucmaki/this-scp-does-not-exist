<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-382</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-382 is stored in a Class 2 Safe at Site-77. The method of its creation is to be kept strictly confidential and any inquisitive researchers have been given disinformation.</p><p>Foundation agents embedded in the scientific community have been dispatched to verify the findings of Gulliver, Curl, and Popper, and report on any further anomalies. In case of discrepancy, additional research teams are to be sent to most popular biology, climate science, and physics textbooks for the specified year to disprove any negative results.</p><p>After the death of Dr. Gulliver, SCP-382 is not to be handled without his written permission. In addition, Dr. Gulliver's son has been assigned to observe SCP-382 from a safe distance until he reaches adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-382 is a sealed glass tube containing approximately 30mL. The object appears to be made from quartz, and shows no visible signs of aging.</p><p>Should an individual gain access to the outside world for more than several minutes, their brain will undergo physical changes due to exposure to electromagnetic fields. Personality traits are affected firstly via cognitive dissonance, with the more bizarre elements being the most problematic. These changes resemble clinical symptoms associated with schizophrenia. After three months at the maximum dosage, subjects will lose voluntary control over bodily functions (including speech) and revert to a primitive state of incoherent mumbling and walking in circles whilst uttering strings of meaningless phrases like "the game freezes" or "it's wrong". Subjects that survive until this stage are considered candidates for SCP-382's testing, and can be terminated without danger of further anomalous reactions.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
