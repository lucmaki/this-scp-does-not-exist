<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-44</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As SCP-44 does not appear to be mobile, it is currently contained in a soundproof security office located in Site-77's Safe SCP wing. Its containment chamber is to be fitted with a camera and microphone at regular intervals and all data regarding the device recovered from it is to be stored in a secure archive.</p><p>All personnel who have been exposed to SCP-44 are to undergo psychological evaluation and amnesticization, and any personnel lost will be replaced from mundane selection procedures. In the event of an SCP-44 breach containment procedures are to be immediately enacted.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-44 is a digital device weighing approximately one kilogram, with a tapered rectangular base measuring ten centimeters by ten centimeters. A small speaker grill is located on the left side of the device, and the telephone handset is located on the right side. SCP-44 has a power source in its base, but it is not wireless.</p><p>SCP-44 displays a number of different programs; these programs will appear to be designed with the intent of tricking the viewer into believing they were designed with this purpose in mind. It has been tested using a number of programs, including a menu system allowing for the user to select an activity, multiple art programs such as photoshop, dot graph or paint program, various Microsoft Windows applications such as Paintbrush or Excel, and various games. No sequence patterns have been found in the selections made by SCP-44; although there are some similarities between generators of different games, this does not mean any one game is more likely to be chosen over another.</p><p>SCP-44 also displays several images of video monitors and televisions aimed at people who have viewed SCP-44. These images will range from television news broadcasts to animated videos representing various television shows that are currently being broadcast. The images seem to be computer generated, but there does not seem to be any relevant data on SCP-44's hard drive or its operating system (the latter has been destroyed by incineration). The images are used as decoration rather than being an application.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 44-1:</strong> Incident Report SCP-44</p><p>SCP-44 was discovered in the home of ██████ █████████, a research scientist at Site-77. It was apparently used for his personal amusement after he had been fired from his previous position at the facility. He had apparently left a note on the front door of the house, which read "Sorry about [deleted], I won\'t make the same mistake again." The note was found to be written in blood.</p><p>Though SCP-44 was not damaged by the fire that destroyed the residence, it has not been accounted for; all of its memories have been lost as well. There is no evidence of any fire damage to the house itself.']</p>
