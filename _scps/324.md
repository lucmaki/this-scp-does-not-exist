<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-324</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-324 is to be kept in a containment chamber at Site-55. A constant state of high temperature and humidity is to be maintained within the chamber, keeping SCP-324 at 100% humidity. Diameter of the chamber must be kept at a maximum of 2 meters for all testing. Due to the nature of its effect, SCP-324 must be kept away from any type of instrumentation or electronics. Any personnel entering the chamber must wear gas masks and protective gear at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-324 is an electronically detachable, human-shaped object composed of a thick, bluish, vaporous gas. SCP-324 moves in a manner similar to that of a dancing humanoid, with its arms swinging in and out with all five fingers spread out at all times. SCP-324 emits no sound from its movement and appears to have no eyes or discernible facial features. The only visible feature is the red appendage protruding from the back, just above the buttocks. Upon being removed from its containment chamber, SCP-324 begins to rapidly produce a low level hum if placed within 5 meters of an electronic device. Once removed from the device, SCP-324's humming stops and it resumes normal behavior until reentering it.</p><p>SCP-324 exhibits a slight resistance to gravity when moving around the room and seems to prefer standing close to walls. When carrying an electronic device within 10 meters of itself, SCP-324 will begin staring at the device intently. If the item is removed from the radius of approximately 3 meters while this is going on, SCP-324 will then begin dancing in attempt to regain it. It is currently unknown why it reacts this way and further testing is required to confirm this theory.</p><p>Each time a test subject interacts with SCP-324 for less than 60 seconds, they will be "infected" by it as follows:</p><p>After 60 seconds, the subject will begin to experience signs of fever. For the next 24 hours, the subject will become increasingly more agitated and mentally unstable. Over the course of 15 to 20 days, the subject will begin to exhibit symptoms usually associated with schizophrenia. After approximately 1 month, the subject will begin to believe that SCP-324 is a sentient entity and will attempt to communicate with it. After 1 month, the subject will begin to refuse treatment and will die of dehydration.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 324-A:</strong> SCP-324 was recovered in the town of ██████, Italy, in an abandoned subway station. The station was heavily damaged, with the majority of the station walls and ceiling collapsed. SCP-324 was found in a small, unoccupied room at the end of a tunnel. The room itself was destroyed, but the walls and ceiling had been reinforced to prevent any further damage. The room was filled with the same thick blue gas as SCP-324. The hallway was completely destroyed, with the only remains being a small pile of dust.']</p>
