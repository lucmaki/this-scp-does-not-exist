<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-998</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-998 is to be surrounded by a 6-meter wide buffer zone, which is to be patrolled by Foundation agents at all times. No civilians are permitted within the buffer zone. If any civilians enter SCP-998 and are within 50m of the SCP-998 perimeter, they are to be terminated on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-998 is an area of about 3km in diameter, located in [REDACTED] on the western coast of the Yudaya Peninsula. SCP-998 is surrounded by a gray metal fence with no visible entrance. The fence surrounds SCP-998 and is connected to the shoreline.</p><p>SCP-998 resembles a small village, with several wooden buildings and a generator providing power. Wooden steps lead from the beach down to the beach at the foot of the mountain on which SCP-998 is situated. On top of the mountain there are several wooden buildings, some of which have been destroyed or are in disrepair.</p><p>At irregular intervals, SCP-998 will spontaneously generate what appears to be a small child between 2 and 12 years old. The child will wander around SCP-998 aimlessly before disappearing again. If any human being approaches SCP-998 and is within 50m of the SCP-998 perimeter, they will disappear without a trace and reappear within 100m of their original location when SCP-998 generates another child.</p><p>SCP-998 generates approximately 1 new child every 20 minutes. During this time, no children appear outside of SCP-998 and no children appear within 50m of the barrier surrounding SCP-998. Children generated within SCP-998 have displayed several anomalous properties:</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
