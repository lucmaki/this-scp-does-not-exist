<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-127</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All SCP-127 instances are currently being kept in an animal containment facility in Area-27 within the ██████ National Forest.</p><p>SCP-127 instances are to be provided with at least eight (8) daily feeds of lab rat chow and two (2) daily doses of metacam per instance, administered via a standard oral syringe. Feedings are to be carried out by D-Class personnel.</p><p>All non-human subjects within area 27 are to be monitored for signs of SCP-127 infection. Subjects who exhibit behavioral changes indicating an increase in strength or aggression are to be treated with metacam. Any subjects showing survival beyond 1 hour after treatment is considered a failed maintenance dose.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-127 is a parasitic entity that infests animals by attaching to the dorsal nerve ganglion of the brain, apparently via an unknown mechanism. Prolonged exposure to SCP-127 causes the host animal to gradually change into a more aggressive and powerful version of itself, known as an SCP-127 instance.</p><p>SCP-127 instances remain dormant inside their hosts during most of the day, but become active at night when they undergo a "regeneration cycle", which usually takes place every few days or weeks. The duration of this cycle coincides with the time between feedings. During this process, SCP-127 will take on a new appearance and continue learning martial arts and fighting techniques from its previous host. This process is also accompanied by neurological improvements in the host's muscle strength, reflexes and senses.</p><p>SCP-127 instances gain all knowledge and skills as well as physical attributes from their previous hosts in addition to their own, increasing their overall strength, stamina and intelligence. New instances will also eventually start taking on different hosts from different areas such as countries, continents or even oceans.</p><p>Thus far, two known species of SCP-127 have been observed:</p><p>SCP-127 is currently kept under observation in an animal containment facility until further notice.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Testing Log 127-A:</p><p><strong>Test 1:</strong></p><p>Subject: D-1738 (a male, female and juvenile raccoon)</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-1738 was placed in a small enclosure with SCP-127 instance. Both dosed with metacam.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> D-1738 acquired new instincts, including enhanced senses of smell and hearing.</p><p><strong>Test 2:</strong></p><p>Subject: D-1738 (a male and juvenile raccoon)</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-1738 was placed in a large enclosure with SCP-127 instance. Both dosed with metacam.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> D-1738 learned to use its claws and teeth more effectively, but lost some of its previous intelligence.</p><p><strong>Test 3:</strong></p><p>Subject: D-823 (a female elephant)</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-823 was given a large quantity of lab rat chow. The following day, D-823 was placed in a large enclosure with SCP-127 instance. Both dosed with metacam.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> After several days, SCP-127 had completely assimilated all knowledge from the elephant and gained increased strength, reflexes, endurance and overall intelligence. Following this, it started communicating with the other SCP objects in the facility through barking and a few grunts.</p><p><strong>Test 4:</strong></p><p>Subjects: D-823 (the elephant), D-823's baby (a female calf) and D-924 (a male gorilla)</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> All subjects restrained in separate enclosures, with feeding troughs located outside their respective enclosures. Doses of metacam were administered to each subject via oral syringe.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Upon completion of the regeneration cycle, each subject was placed in a different enclosure, with feeding troughs located outside the respective enclosures. The following day, each subject exhibited new aggressive behavior towards other test subjects. The example provided by the gorilla was particularly violent. These results are currently being investigated.</p>
