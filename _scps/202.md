<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-202</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-202's position is known and has been determined, as are its dimensions. Access to the area where SCP-202 is located requires a minimum of two Level 2 personnel. A net with a 1 m clearance around the entire area is to be used to prevent casualties from SCP-202.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-202 is a large American bullfrog that, from the size of its body and the length of its tail, can grow to be over 2 meters in length. SCP-202 has two large, green eyes and two ashy spots on each side of its head. Its skin is dark grey, except for the back and sides of its body, which are light brown. The area around SCP-202’s mouth is an orange colour due to excretions and saliva.</p><p>SCP-202's solidity makes it impossible to pass through. Attempts to do so will result in injuries due to its great physical strength. The only way to get through SCP-202 is via [DATA EXPUNGED]</p><p>SCP-202’s presence causes severe psychological trauma in people that come into contact with it. Even if they have difficulty breathing, people will suffer severe distress until they leave the area or they are removed from SCP-202’s vicinity.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> SCP-202 was first seen in █████, ██ on ██/██/2003. A Mr. ████████, who was a [DATA EXPUNGED] at the time, was driving his wife around the city. They came upon SCP-202, which startled SCP-████. While she was distracted, Mr. ████████ was able to turn and drive away.</p><p>Upon coming back home, Mr. ████████ told his wife about the incident, and she in turn reported it to the Foundation. SCP-202 was retrieved by Foundation operatives led by Dr. ████████ on ██/██/2003.</p><p>SCP-202 was sent to Site ██ and is currently contained in a standard containment cell with a 1\xa0m clearance around it.']</p>
