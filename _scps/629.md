<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-629</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-629 is to be held in a standard containment locker at Site-██. It is to be regularly checked for any changes in its structure, and any change in its weight is to be investigated. At no time are the two halves of SCP-629 to be separated.</p><p>Objects touching the outside edge of SCP-629 (such as items resting on the surface) are to be inspected for any alterations to their shape or texture. If alterations occur and affect the items being examined, they are to be kept in a separate room until further notice and tested for any anomalous effects.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-629 is a wooden board measuring 2.5 m by 0.5 m, with two holes (about 0.4 m diameter) in the center of its surface. When played, SCP-629 produces a variety of sounds similar to those produced by an old-fashioned phonograph. A human being may sit on SCP-629 and will be transported to the location where they had been sitting when playing SCP-629.</p><p>SCP-629 was found in ████████, United Kingdom during an investigation of anomalous entities related to the ██████ family. SCP-629 appeared to be one of many phono tapes owned by the family, and was found in a box labeled "The Summer Words Issue." Audio recordings were subsequently discovered among their other possessions.</p><p>Only one person has been able to use SCP-629 while they were still alive; this person was experimenting with its effects while intoxicated prior to their death. It is believed that the phono tape in this instance was not moving very far from them at any given time, as similar instances have occurred despite living over eight hundred miles apart from each other at the time.</p><p>Upon playback of these audio recordings, subjects have reported feeling a sense of nostalgia for an experience that could only have happened during their summer vacation at a family resort in [REDACTED]. Several psychological examinations conducted with these subjects afterward confirmed that they had spent much of their childhood at this resort and therefore were strongly affected when recalling this incident later in life.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> Audio recordings recovered from the possessions of the ██████ family are listed below.</p><p><strong>Audio recording:</strong> "The Summer Words Issue"</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> [REDACTED]</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The voice of a woman is heard, speaking in an old-fashioned British accent. She is sitting by a window and has her arms folded across her chest. She is wearing a dark shirt and pants, with her brown hair tied back in a bun. Two objects are visible on this subject\'s desk. One of these is a deck of cards, and the other is a wooden phonograph playing a recording of the voice. At the end of this recording, the woman\'s voice can be heard speaking to someone off-camera.</p><p><strong>Audio recording:</strong> "The Summer Words Issue"</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> [REDACTED]</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The voice of a young boy can be heard speaking. He appears to be standing outside and is wearing shorts, as well as his shirt and sandals. He appears to be leaning against a tree while looking down at his feet. He speaks in an American accent, but there is a noticeable difference in his speech compared to the woman\'s recording from the previous one. This difference is noticable even when the recordings are played simultaneously and cannot be accounted for by any known method of speech analysis.</p><p><strong>Audio recording:</strong> "The Summer Words Issue"</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> [REDACTED]</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The same woman as in the previous recording appears leaning against a window sill and looking out at a lake or ocean from inside a building. The same boy as in the previous recording is also seen sitting on the floor with his back against a wall, presumably sleeping. The woman\'s dress appears to have been ripped and stained during this incident. A small pile of sewing supplies is seen on the floor next to their legs.</p><p><strong>Audio recording:</strong> "The Summer Words Issue"</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> [REDACTED]</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The same young boy as in the previous recording is seen standing beside his mother who is standing at a sink with her back towards him while washing dishes. She hastily turns around as he speaks, with both of them jumping slightly as they see each other. It appears that they had both been unaware of his presence until this point. Both are dressed in swimsuits and t-shirts, but it is unclear if either of them has been swimming recently or if this was simply their casual attire for staying at the resort. The woman does not appear to have noticed any damage on her clothing.</p><p><strong>Audio recording:</strong> "The Summer Words Issue"</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> [REDACTED]</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The same woman as in the previous recording is found sitting on the beach, holding a book and staring at an open page containing what appears to be an illustration of some sort of flower or plant. A storm cloud looms in the distance over the water and there are several boats nearby but none are in view at this time; possibly it happened during monsoon season. There appears to be some kind of fluid dripping onto or coming out of the plant in the illustration (the object seen floating at right angles to it). The woman\'s eyes close momentarily and she looks away from the page when she hears someone approaching behind her.']</p>
