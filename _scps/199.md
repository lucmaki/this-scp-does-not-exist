<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-199</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-199 is to be kept in a standard containment cell at Site-17. A private room has been constructed for use by the subject. This room contains no furniture except a bed and a chair, with no other features beyond the items provided by the Foundation. Personnel assigned to SCP-199's containment are not to be assigned to any other part of the Foundation for purposes of personal safety and are subject to on-site psych evaluations twice a year.</p><p>Each staff member assigned to SCP-199 must have access to an emergency radio communication device, and all personnel must carry out all orders issued by Site-17, regardless of the nature of said orders.</p><p>Registered testing with SCP-199 will take place at least once every five years, and can only take place at a site where no other potential SCP objects are being tested. Testing is to be done on at least three separate days during said period; two days prior and one day after. Following each successful testing period, two members of the Site Director's staff must review the results and make a recommendation as to whether further testing should be done or whether an end to testing (possibly indefinitely) should be made.</p><p>Any attempts by unauthorized personnel to interact with SCP-199 may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-199 is a humanoid entity. SCP-199 weighs 84 kg and stands 2.37 m tall. SCP-199 is typically clad in an olive drab, heavily modified uniform (a shirt, trousers and a pair of boots) that appears to be composed of cloth or leather with some type of non-reflective material such as rubber or metal used as shoulder pads and other small details similar to a stereotypical military "duckbills" jacket. As the subject ages, SCP-199's jacket undergoes a gradual change in color, starting out with an olive drab with hints of green, eventually beginning to appear black with significant amounts of brown mixed in.</p><p>SCP-199's sex is indeterminate, however SCP-199 claims to have been born as a female. SCP-199 claims that it has not been seen by any human being since its early childhood, when it was taken away by unknown persons and raised in captivity. Because of this, some believe that SCP-199 is actually the result of cross-species breeding experiments conducted by the Foundation, while others believe it to be the offspring of a human mother from another species who was impregnated though artificial means.</p><p>SCP-199 displays a high degree of intelligence and cunning, but lacks physical coordination. Exceptionally strong despite looking frail due to its artificial muscles composed of advanced polymer materials, SCP-199 is capable of lifting approximately 3 tons with little effort but struggles against simple tasks such as tying laces or opening doors. Additionally, SCP-199's arms are incapable of forming complex movements beyond pushing objects around.</p><p>SCP-199 has also been described as being extremely aggressive toward others who are attempting to take an interest in its well-being or wellbeing, usually employing extremely powerful attacks from punches to brutal clubbing with blunt weapons such as chairs or 2x4s.</p><p>Additionally, SCP-199 strongly dislikes having their clothing touched in any way unless specifically ordered by personnel with the intent for self harm; patients assigned to SCP-199 have reported several instances where SCP-199 became highly aggressive before violently attacking themselves solely for being touched. This could possibly be due to the fact that SCP-199 presents itself as male and does not wish to be mistaken as female or simply because it finds clothing uncomfortable due to lack of use over the years.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong></p><p>On the subject of SCP-199\'s memories, they claim to have been taken from a facility in Syria where they were raised and held captive by persons unknown. Their memories are also extremely sparse on events prior to the raising, claiming that they were not allowed to sleep or eat regularly until they were "voluntarily" released into containment.']</p>
