<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-616</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the fact that SCP-616 is a phenomenon and not an object, containment requires no specific procedures. Attempts at halting SCP-616 should be avoided by all means; if this option is unavailable, information should be leaked to the press in order to negate any threat posed by SCP-616.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-616 is a phenomenon in which no matter the composition or context of an audio recording made on an SCP-616 artifact, the recorded sound will always be the same. It is unknown where SCP-616 artifacts come from or how they are made, but it is theorized that SCP-616 may have something to do with certain anomalous humanoids.</p><p></p><p>SCP-616 artifacts are generally made out of one of two materials; wood and stone. However, they can also be made out of less common materials, such as ivory and ceramic. Of any used material, the most common material found within these artifacts is human flesh, with sapient DNA being the most common material provided to SCP-616 artifacts. When an SCP-616 artifact does not produce sapient DNA, it is necessary for a living subject to be used as a source for the production of sapient DNA. The sapient DNA then creates a member of a new species - which may or may not be humanoid - that resembles the recorded music.</p><p>The first recorded instance of SCP-616 was discovered in 1971, in ██████, Alabama. The only documented recordings have been those produced with sapient DNA from one John ████████ (a serial killer).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Below are the known instances of SCP-616.</p><p>John ████████\'s song "You\'re Gonna Go Far, Kid"</p>
