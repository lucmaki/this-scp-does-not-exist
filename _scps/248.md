<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-248</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-248 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment unit. No individual has been permitted entrance to the containment chamber for study of the anomaly, as testing of any type can have extremely unpredictable results. Any personnel wishing access to SCP-248 for testing purposes must report for testing at least one week in advance.</p><p>SCP-248 may not have any sharp or pointed objects in its cell. This includes but is not limited to: pencils, scissors, knifes, needles, thread and similar objects. Failure to comply with this regulation may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-248 is a humanoid entity, approximately 2.5 m in height with the frame of an “average” human male. The anomalous properties of SCP-248 are that it does not age past a specific age (See attached document for details). The precise nature of the anomaly is as yet unknown.</p><p>SCP-248 shows no signs of any disease, illness, or normal wear and tear on the body. It is apparent that SCP-248 does not require food, water, or rest. However, it does show some degree of fatigue when studied closely (See attached photo). It should be noted that there is no evidence that this specimen is capable of “sleeping” in any sense of the word.</p><p>The most obvious feature of SCP-248 is its lack of several relatively common senses. These include visual, olfactory and tactile. There have been no recorded instances where SCP-248 has been able to perceive certain aspects in this manner. Although other senses such as thermal have never been tested on SCP-248, it is theorized that if they were available the organism would have activated them at some point in time during the aforementioned time frame.</p><p>SCP-248 displays some behavioral patterns which are almost identical to those exhibited by children between ages 0 and approximately 5 years old. The organism emits a high pitched giggle when it is fed a large snack. During this period, it will also engage in very small talk with other adult staff members and attempt to play games with them (See attached image for comparison).</p><p>SCP-248 came to the Foundation's attention after local media reported an attempted kidnapping involving a young child in ██████, ██ on ██/██/1965 (See attachment ███-██), which resulted in his disappearance along with the kidnapper(s). As such, the case was placed under Foundation investigation and SCP-248 was brought into custody.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 1:</strong> Testing Log</p><p>Testing with SCP-248 has been limited to the following 2 areas:</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-248 (See attached photo)</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> SCP-248 is handed a small piece of paper, seemingly at random. The subject must remove the words written on the paper and place them into a large container, as described above. The subject will then be given another piece of paper, without the words written on it. The subject must again copy the words onto the new paper until they are satisfied with the results.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> The subject will attempt to write words onto the blank page until they are satisfied with the result. After this, the subject will proceed to play a game with another staff member, in which they must make 5 successfully completed attempts at drawing a certain shape onto a chalkboard. (See attached image for further details).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> SCP-248 has proven extremely difficult to communicate with. Although it seems able to understand human speech, it does not appear to be able to visually perceive objects or people. It has shown no sign of any reaction when presented with non-human entities, however. This can often lead to confusion among staff members as they try to determine if the entity is capable of understanding them.']</p>
