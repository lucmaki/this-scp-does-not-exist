<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-194</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Foundation's Berlin bunker has been constructed to contain SCP-194. Current plans are for this site to be heavily fortified and to serve as the primary inter-Security coordination center for dealing with the particulars of SCP-194. A full staff of research personnel is assigned to study SCP-194 and any other information regarding it.</p><p></p><p>SCP-194 is contained in a reinforced steel cage, measuring 1 m x 1 m x 0.7 m, suspended by cables from a crane mounted on the roof of the bunker. The cage is equipped with an internal communications array and monitoring equipment, only one entrance is to be opened at any time, and none of the equipment may be removed without consent from two Level 3 researchers.</p><p>The location of SCP-194 is to remain secure at all times. All personnel entering SCP-194 must wear approved SCPs containment garb that include anti-radiation shielding (the shielding should be replaced every day), and be accompanied by at least one armed guard.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-194 is an anomalous construct that can be described as two humanoid figures (hereafter SCP-194-1 and SCP-194-2) with their heads connected via a flexible steel neck. The central body consists of various steel and aluminum plates, many of which bear the image of a star within a circle. SCP-194 has no apparent motor or control system beyond the reflexive twitching of its mouths and eyes, but it obeys human commands by means of what appears to be telekinesis.</p><p>SCP-194 displays a degree of intelligence and self-preservation, having built itself a steel cage and developed a crude language based on the visual symbols carved into its plates. It also owes allegiance to no government or leader, but displays habitually belligerent behavior towards all non-anomalous humans. It responds to both friendly and hostile behavior with verbal taunts and threats.</p><p>In cases where its cage has been opened in an unprotected location, SCP-194 has escaped its containment more than twelve times; however, none of these instances have survived longer than three weeks. As soon as escape becomes feasible, it will kill any non-anomalous humans it encounters.</p><p>History: </p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 194-1:</strong> SCP-194 was discovered on ██/██/1979, in a small abandoned factory in ████████, ███████. It was discovered by Foundation personnel working in the area, and sent to Site-██ for containment. Further investigation revealed that a local man, ███████ ████████, had been experimenting with anomalous items in his garage until his death in a car accident. His collection included SCP-194, SCP-582, and two other unknown items of similar origin.</p><p><strong>Notes from SCP-194:</strong></p><p>"What do you want from me?"</p><p>"A friend."</p><p>"I do not have friends."</p><p>"I\'m not asking for a friend."</p><p>"I don\'t have friends."</p><p>"Then you\'re alone."</p><p>"I don\'t care."</p><p>"Then I\'m alone."</p><p>"You\'re not alone."</p><p>SCP-194 was subsequently contained at Site-██. For more information regarding its containment history, see Addendum 194-1.</p>
