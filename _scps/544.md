<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-544</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-544 is to be stored in a standard containment locker. No testing is allowed with SCP-544. SCP-544 is to be wiped down with ammonia solution at least once per week, the remaining debris is to be disposed of in an approved incinerator.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-544 is a short, unassuming three-stringed lyre (or "cordophone") with a total of 61 strings. SCP-544 has no visible holes or surfaces, and when an individual attempts to grasp it in their hand, they instead perceive a "familiar tactile sensation" of an object they are familiar with. SCP-544's strings are not stiff, and instead have the same material properties as human skin. SCP-544 is flexible enough to be folded up into a flat disc with rounded edges.</p><p>When played, SCP-544 produces sounds that are very similar to the native language of whoever was playing before it was played. This does not occur in any wooden instrument or instrument that does not produce its own sound; when played by an unknown musician, the sounds produced are not similar in any manner.</p><p>SCP-544 was recovered from a home in ███████ Villages, England after reports of domestic abuse were received by local authorities, who later found ██ bodies buried in the basement bedroom. Autopsy reports positively identified each of the deceased persons as being elderly and having been dead for approximately several months at time of death, based on decomposition and other factors. The living room was void of furniture and other belongings besides SCP-544.</p><p>If an individual is acquainted with anything native to the Caucasian languages group (such as English), then they can sense its presence when holding SCP-544.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> On July 29, 20██, SCP-544 was discovered to produce sounds that were similar to the language of the extinct Aryan people. An investigation team was dispatched to ██████, Germany and managed to contact a Foundation linguist. After several months, the linguist determined that SCP-544's sounds were not similar to any language previously recorded by the Foundation.</p><p>The linguists have concluded that SCP-544 does not produce sounds based on any language previously recorded by the Foundation, but instead produces sounds based on a hypothetical language that existed in Ancient Germany. The theory is that since SCP-544 is an instrument that was played in Ancient Germany (or could be played in Ancient Germany), its sounds are representative of a hypothetical language that existed during that time.</p><p>SCP-544 was placed under permanent lockdown. All personnel assigned to SCP-544's containment are to be kept at least two meters away from it at all times.</p><p>Appendage 2 has been attached to SCP-544, and is used for testing purposes."]</p>
