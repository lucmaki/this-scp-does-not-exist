<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-361</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-361 is to be kept in a stainless steel locker at Site-77. Access is restricted to site security personnel with Level 4 clearance and above and a minimum of four (4) years of Supervisory experience. No more than two (2) units may be on hand at any time, and all personnel working with SCP-361 must have been trained in the anomalous effects of SCP-361.</p><p>The containers used for SCP-361 are to be inspected every two hours for possible damage or tampering. All such damage or tampering is to be noted and recorded, and SCP-361 is to be replaced immediately. If SCP-361 should lose its anomalous properties due to breach of containment, an expendable special agent is to deploy the replacement unit into restricted storage before the lost ones can be noticed by non-anomalous personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-361 appears to be a forty-seven (47) inch chef's knife with a wooden handle. The blade is stainless steel and measures approximately one (1) inch in width. When held by an experienced user, SCP-361 can affect the knife's physical properties, causing it to cut as if it were made of a different material.</p><p>The effects of SCP-361 appear only in its vicinity when wielded by an experienced user and only for tasks within a competently performed kitchen. Experienced chefs who use SCP-361 claim that using SCP-361 makes them more efficient in the kitchen.</p><p>When used properly, SCP- 361 is capable of cutting through most ordinary materials with apparent ease, including common vegetables, fruits, meats and cheeses. The outer layer of foods being cut instantly detaches from the rest and appears to dissolve away into air. All matter cut in this manner is sentient, though not sapient. As such, these materials will not willingly come into contact with any living beings except those who perform kitchen tasks regularly and are therefore familiar with the anomalous properties of SCP- 361 .</p><p>However, non-human sapients viewing samples of this food would disagree emphatically: they report the sense of cold that accompanies it and will refuse to eat it unless they are given regular doses of strengthening medicine intended to slow down their metabolism. Eating food from SCP-361 will cause violent gastric distress; therefore all personnel who use SCP-361 must have preternaturally strong stomachs and have been instructed on what to expect in the event that it should get loose from its container.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Following Incident 361-A, no more than two (2) units of SCP-361 may be on hand at any time. Any breach of this protocol will result in immediate termination of all personnel involved and the entirety of the experiment for that day being declared a failure.</p><p>Incident 361-A</p><p>On 05/17/██, a sudden outbreak of non-human sapients began appearing in the areas surrounding Site-77. No anomalous properties were noted until a team of researchers was sent to verify the existence of SCP-361. The following is an excerpt from the log from that day's incident (excerpt begins at 11:00 AM):</p><p><strong>Field Team 2:</strong></p><p>The following is a transcript of their log entry for the incident (excerpt begins at 11:00 AM):</p><p><strong>Field Team 2:</strong>"]</p>
