<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-492</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-492 is to be kept in a plastic storage container located within the containment chamber of Site-██. The chamber is to be regularly inspected for corrosion and any deterioration of surrounding materials. Any degradation of the object's containment chamber is to be documented and a replacement chamber constructed.</p><p>In the event that SCP-492's containment chamber is damaged beyond repair, the object is to be held within the containment chamber currently being constructed for the purpose of containing SCP-093.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-492 is a wooden box measuring 1.5 m x 1.5 m x .75 m in dimensions. Its exterior is lined with what appears to be human skin tissue, of the type commonly used for surgical suturing and wound repair. The skin does not stand out from the wood of SCP-492, but instead appears to match perfectly.</p><p>SCP-492 will, at random intervals, open itself to reveal evidence that shows that it is inhabited by a conscious, sapient entity when it was once inhabited by a living human being who desires the object to contain their consciousness after death. The interior of the interior is filled with items originally belonging to the entity which wishes to inhabit SCP-492, indicating that they are still alive and in good health within the container.</p><p>No harm has ever been done to SCP-492 by any living human entity whether or not they wanted to occupy the object or not. It has been subjected to extreme temperatures (see Incident Log) such as fire and high radiation as well as being knocked askew and pushed around in an attempt to destroy it, yet none of these actions have caused any damage or discomfort to SCP-492. Despite this outcome, it is still kept in containment because of its anomalous property: prior testing has shown that the odds of SCP-492 containing a conscious entity other than the one who originally resided within it - chosen at random for each opening - are 1:1 (a majority of instances will contain no anomalies outside of their natural state), regardless of any destructive tests.</p><p>Incident Log:</p><p>SCP-492 was placed in quarantine following reports that claimed that several canisters filled with smoke located near [REDACTED] had contained a previously unknown organism believed to be made up entirely of smoke without a body. There were no remnants found in any area where bodies were found either inside or outside of the container and no further information could be obtained from NASA or civilian organizations involved with space exploration due to classified issues revolving around National Security Objectives and Intelligence Sources.</p><p>When asked about possible planets known for harboring life, Dr. ██████ informed Site Command that he was looking into possibilities pertaining to accounts concerning extra-terrestrial life on planet Earth over centuries past before being sent away for questioning about his failure to preserve records and notes regarding previous SCP investigations involving organisms of this nature due to his extensive involvement with said endeavors prior to his joining the project. A search through previous files revealed information concerning several individuals claiming various properties pertaining to extraterrestrial life forms, including 'green men' resembling similar depictions used by Native American tribes for stories about strange creatures outside of our solar system many years ago; one subject claiming extraterrestrial life exists on Earth with residents now residing within it having reached the level of technological prowess which allows them greater levels than ours abroad in space; several individuals claiming there is extraterrestrial life on Earth but not on land or sea; only four claims being processed currently additionally including species that resemble manatees and large fish being able to survive indefinitely off vegetation such as algae; and two claims stating that there are several groups or organizations capable of bringing extraterrestrials here if something goes wrong on another planet capable of sustaining them (the Foundation's operation involving SCP-093). Further examination after Dr. ██████'s departure revealed several irregularities which suggest Dr. ██████'s whereabouts may be connected with those suspected extremists now associated with the Kinetic Incident (see below).</p><p>The most recent objects contained within SCP-492 are:</p><p>The following documents were also found along with these contents.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> Incident Log</p><p><strong>Incident Log:</strong></p><p>03/04/20██</p><p>SCP-492 was discovered in a warehouse containing the remains of a [REDACTED] facility located in ██████, California. The area was being used as a temporary storage facility for items that were being sent for disposal. When the site was searched, SCP-492 was found to be missing from its original location but was recovered intact from inside one of the storage containers.</p><p>The contents of the container which contained SCP-492 were replaced with low-alcohol content beverages and food items. It is believed that due to the degradation of the food, drink and other objects within SCP-492 over the course of time, this may have been the reason for SCP-492 opening and allowing for its contents to be transferred into it. The container was then resealed and stored in an approved containment unit.</p><p>Inquiry into possible causes attempting to open SCP-492's containment chamber is pending."]</p>
