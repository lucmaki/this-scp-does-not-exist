<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-226</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-226 is to be kept in a standard Safe-class containment locker at Site-28. Personnel working with or in the area of SCP-226 are to wear full body protection and eye protection during application of SCP-226.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-226 is a pair of flesh-coloured silicone earplugs. SCP-226 weighs 35 grams and is 6.8 mm in diameter, with a length of 13.5 mm. SCP-226 has smooth bumps on each end, similar in shape to the physiological pressure receptors in an ear.</p><p>SCP-226 inhibits the filtering out of external stimuli by the human auditory system, making it appear as if sounds are significantly louder than they actually are to any given individual wearing them. This effect is greatly amplified when the wearer is listening with both ears at once, but reduces substantially when listening with only one ear.</p><p>In addition to its anomalous effects on hearing, SCP-226 also causes auditory hallucinations to occur when worn, triggered by virtually any loud sound regardless of its source or nature. The exact nature and content of these hallucinations vary from subject to subject. Occasionally, subjects will report hearing voices that speak in languages they do not know.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 226-A:</strong> SCP-226 was recovered from the headquarters of a clandestine religious cult in ████████, Texas, US. The Foundation was alerted to the cult's presence by the U.S. Department of Justice, who had been investigating allegations of child abuse within the cult and discovered the existence of SCP-226 during the course of their investigation. The Foundation subsequently took control of the investigation and ultimately acquired SCP-226."]</p>
