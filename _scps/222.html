<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-222</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Attempts at containing SCP-222 have been entirely unsuccessful. The Foundation has assigned Archival agents to investigate the containment of SCP-222, with the goal of explaining SCP-222's anomalous effects via memetic countermeasures and memetic amnestic distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-222 is a phenomenon affecting individuals who are married to each other.</p><p>SCP-222 manifests as an anomalous effect when the mark of marriage is present between two subjects in any context. This effect, termed SCP-222-1, causes subjects to be unaware of new information or ideas if they have not already been made aware of them by their spouses, regardless of their mental state before marriage.</p><p>This effect will last indefinitely until death separates the pair. It is possible for SCP-222 to affect those who are separated, but the effect always stops when the subject dies.</p><p>SCP-222 has no effect on non-humanoid organisms; however, it carries no risks to the wellbeing of these individuals since they are not considered part of the affected individual's community.</p><p>Affected individuals are incapable of producing offspring without prior express permission from their spouses. Attempts at conceiving via artificial methods (such as sperm donation and surrogate motherhood) will either fail or terminate within two weeks due to termination of the affected individual.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum 1:</strong> Document #222-01</p><p>Two women separated by more than 3,000 kilometers have been affected by SCP-222 to date. A note addressed to the 'M' in the logo of their respective wedding invitations suggests that they are unaware of each other's existence, despite both being married to men who recently participated in Foundation research. Both women have been unable to conceive children due to termination. The note has been translated into English and is reproduced here:</p><p>I am writing this letter to you for one reason only, to tell you that I know you exist. I am aware of your existence because I am your wife. I am aware of your existence because my husband is your husband. My husband is writing this letter to you to tell you that he knows you exist. I know that you exist because we are married. We are married because we know each other.</p><p>You and I will never meet, but we are connected through our spouses, who are connected in turn because they know each other. You and I are connected, but we are not aware of each other's existence. We will never meet because we will never know each other."]</p>
