<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-33</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-33 is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-██. It is not currently permitted to be taken out of its chamber by any persons not assigned as a test subject for purposes of investigation of its properties. Three pairs of earplugs are also to be provided to personnel working with it.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-33 is an item manufactured by ████████ Institute of Surgical Technology, Inc. The object is a pair of earplugs (SCP-33 designators SCP-33-1 and SCP-33-2) which, when worn with the convex side facing outward, can achieve the capacity to control a ship weighing approximately 6 tons and crewed by two personnel for periods ranging from 15 minutes to several hours.</p><p>Regardless of whether the convex side faces inward or outward, the object will not function under ambient temperatures below 0°C. Testing has shown that it must be used in conjunction with one's ears at temperatures of at least 10°C in order to be effective: prior to testing, the ear canal should be cleared of debris and wax roughly the size of a small pea. The object should be placed on the affected ear and tightened up to create almost complete occlusion.</p><p>If no individuals are present on a ship when its exterior temperature drops below 5°C, the crew members' mental state will begin to deteriorate if they remain on duty beyond 8 hours; individuals will become confused and disoriented, often beginning monologues about what their duties are or what the name of their ship is. However, if individuals are on board a ship when its exterior reaches 5°C or lower, they will begin to manifest symptoms consistent with high doses of class A amnestics. These effects abate when sufficient time has elapsed since exterior ventilation was stopped. Members of test crews have been noted to cease being coherent entirely after 24 hours at these temperatures; later tests have succeeded in keeping them aware longer than 30 days.</p><p>It is currently unknown whether this effect is carried over to other ships or vessels; however, it has been demonstrated more than once that loss of contact between a command vessel and its crew occurs only when both are inside SCP-33's effective range. This suggests that loss of contact may result only when both vessels are within SCP-33's range.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Testing Log</p><p>Testing of SCP-33's effectiveness in temperatures below 0°C began in early 20██, under the guise of containing a 'Temporary' containment breach. Testing continued with the general assumption that, if the object could be rendered effective in temperatures below 0°C, it would be able to function at very low temperatures for extended periods. The first test was conducted on ██/██/20██, when the exterior temperature of SCP-33's range was lowered from -25°C to -18°C.</p><p><strong>Test #:</strong> 33-01</p><p><strong>Subjects:</strong> D-Class personnel (see Containment Procedures)</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-33 has been instructed to enter SCP-33 and remain inside until he is certain that no other life forms remain on the ship that he can tell are currently alive. He is then to exit SCP-33 and signal termination of testing.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> D-Class is found unresponsive and comatose in his quarters approximately 1 hour after initial entry into SCP-33. After approximately 2 hours, he appears to recover consciousness; however, he exhibits incoherence and confusion while trying to maintain conversation. He returns to the testing chamber and five days later is shown to retain no memory of the events that transpired in SCP-33.</p><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Using a combination of low resolution cameras and motion sensors, it was found that D-Class' body temperature had risen significantly over time; as near as could be determined, D-Class' body temperature rose from an initial value of approximately 32°C to 48°C over the course of several hours before receding to its original value. This is hypothesized to have been caused by heat generated internally by the body itself; given that no other life forms were present on the ship when this test was conducted, this suggests that heat generation alone was enough to protect D-Class by maintaining his body temperature at a level sufficient for survival.</p><p>D-Class was then sent back into SCP-33 and instructed to remain inside for an additional 18 hours before exiting. His body temperature rose again to an average of 53°C over the course of another 3 hours; however, no further increase in body temperature occurred until he was removed from SCP-33 and showed signs of recuperation from his previous incoherence. Further tests have shown that recuperation from incoherence occurs faster at higher temperatures.</p>
