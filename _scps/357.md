<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-357</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation web sites and other fronts have been activated to round up and detain all news crews and civilian witnesses who might provide evidence of an ongoing event.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-357 is a minor, generally peaceful urban disturbance occurring on the Fourth of July across the United States. The initial manifestation occurred in 1960 with the recorded deaths of â–ˆ men at a demonstration against the United States government's decision to continue using nuclear weapons. Foundation personnel have been present during subsequent SCP-357 manifestations, and have successfully contained them each time.</p><p>The cause of SCP-357 is currently unknown. However, it has been strongly suggested that the infrequent presence of Old Testament prophets over this period of time indicates a warning for our species. It is also possible that SCP-357 represents the Biblical "Day of Vengeance" that God would take from us should we continue to inflict death on our fellow humans and animals.</p>
