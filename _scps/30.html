<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-30</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-30 is to be held in a temperature-controlled, oxygenated environment, 1.5 m high at all times, for further study of its behavior. SCP-30 is not to be disturbed.</p><p>As a result of existing in a tightly controlled environment and being an only 'predominantly' aquatic creature, SCP-30 is not considered to be at risk of becoming lost or going extinct as most other SCPs are. Instead, it is in the researchers' best interest and the Foundation's to encourage public interest in SCP-30 and its study and containment. This may involve social media campaigns, scientific publications, press releases, etc.</p><p>Any documentation discovered, regardless of source or method of preservation, may be used by the Foundation to further its goals concerning SCP-30.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-30 is a single celled organism found in the Pacific Ocean. SCP-30, while biologically identifiable and functionally similar to other members of its species, possesses distinctly 'bioelectrical' traits and behaviors.</p><p>SCP-30 consumes oxygen suspended in water and can survive at depths up to 1000 meters. At this depth, it will voluntarily withdraw into an underground tubular structure or burrow for periods lasting up to several weeks. SCP-30 does not breathe normally but instead excretes and absorbs oxygen from the water through pores in the outer shell and through its dermal layer.</p><p>When exposed to atmospheric pressure above this depth, SCP-30 grows a protective exoskeleton consisting of both calcium carbonate and chitin hardened with calcium nitrate. During this time, SCP-30 enters a state of suspended animation. In this state, it begins to show signs of electrochemical activity.</p><p>SCP-30's exoskeleton will rupture under pressure and pull outwards, allowing for greater expansion of the organism and allowing the organism to resurface if necessary. Embedded within its arms are tendrils able to draw in ambient oxygen from the surrounding water and absorb it through modified capillaries that have been constructed from calcium nitrate.</p><p>This hydrostatic action also allows SCP-30 to retain its ability to suspend itself in air indefinitely during daytime hours. These arms also contain a series of bioelectrical cells which produce an electrical field capable of repelling any fish that attempt to touch it or approach it closely. This field is nonlinear, generating an electrodynamic force of roughly 300 g when fully charged (though the exact amount varies depending on variables such as size). Testing shows that animals attempting to pass through SCP-30's lightning bolt form a path through it at more than 3 times the speed they would normally travel over their own bodies.</p><p>Extensive testing has shown that this 'lightning bolt' form is extremely conductive and dense enough to act as a powerful repellent against all forms of biological matter. It is theorized that if SCP-30 was placed in an electrolyte solution (such as seawater) rather than standing water, these properties would not be as pronounced and it may in fact be easier for SCP-30 to interact with living organisms since… well… nothing can stand against it! Reducing SCP-30's water content will cause the organism to show fewer effects related to having one of its most potent defense mechanisms disabled.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong> SCP-30 is not a single species but rather a collection of organisms, each with its own unique set of traits and anomalous properties. Researchers have worked to separate and identify them (see the following list).</p><p>SCP-30 was found in the Ogasawara Islands in 1812 by a Japanese expedition led by Itaya Kinoshita. The organisms were catalogued and given full names, including what appeared to be a series of numbers or letters. A specimen designated SCP-30 has since been taken into Foundation custody. The other organisms are currently designated 'Other SCPs' for the purposes of this document.</p><p>There were two different methods used to catalog SCP-30. The first involved filling an entire room with water and exposing it to SCP-30 for several days. After the organism had been brought to the surface, the room was drained of water, leaving a large pile of calcite at the bottom. This pile was then broken apart, revealing that the organism's exoskeleton had grown over the floor and walls of the room. The organism was also found to be quite resistant to damage from small arms fire or even blunt force trauma. Despite this, testing showed that while SCP-30 was able to maintain its exoskeleton once it had been damaged, it would not repair itself until it had been brought to the surface again.</p><p>The second method involved placing SCP-30 in a glass jar filled with water and subjecting it to atmospheric pressure. SCP-30 was able to suspend itself in air as long as its water content did not drop below 30%. Once removed from the pressure, SCP-30 began to grow a protective exoskeleton made from calcium carbonate and calcium nitrate.</p><p>SCP-30's skeletal structure is similar to that of the Hydra (an organism possessing numerous independent heads) but with a number of differences:</p><p>The cells within SCP-30's body are capable of reacting to changes in water content by switching between their normal electrical charge density and their 'normal' charge density when exposed to atmospheric pressure."]</p>
