<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-484</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-484 is contained within a 3 × 3 m room located in Site-██. Food and water containers are to be placed near SCP-484's main entrance, along with a storage container for the instance of SCP-682 currently held inside SCP-484. All exits from this room are to be monitored by armed guards.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-484 is a saltwater land snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. SCP-484 is capable of emitting and expelling organic matter from its mouth at a rate of 5 cm per hour, which has revealed to be consistent within the presence of water. Through experimentation, it has been determined that an average containment unit is capable of holding 1 instance of SCP-682 (Currently located within).</p><p>SCP-484 was initially discovered on ██/██/19██ after several nearby civilians reported an unusually large crab beneath the water's surface. This resulted in the Foundation covering up this report and providing a false appearance of SCP-484 being a normal specimen.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-682 was originally discovered in the ████████ river in ████, England by SCP-███ on ██/██/19██ and was initially contained in a 10\xa0cm x 8\xa0cm x 5\xa0cm glass jar, with a date of ██/██/19██. SCP-682's anomalous properties were discovered when it began to grow at an exponential rate despite being kept in a non-anomalous setting. During the containment of SCP-682, the Foundation confiscated all known instances of SCP-682, but it is currently unknown if all instances were safely destroyed or not.</p><p>SCP-682's initial containment log appears as follows:</p>
