<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-484</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-484 is contained within a 3 × 3 m room located in Site-██. Food and water containers are to be placed near SCP-484's main entrance, along with a storage container for the instance of SCP-682 currently held inside SCP-484. All exits from this room are to be monitored by armed guards.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-484 is a saltwater land snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. SCP-484 is capable of emitting and expelling organic matter from its mouth at a rate of 5 cm per hour, which has revealed to be consistent within the presence of water. Through experimentation, it has been determined that an average containment unit is capable of holding 1 instance of SCP-682 (Currently located within).</p><p>SCP-484 was initially discovered on ██/██/19██ after several nearby civilians reported an unusually large crab beneath the water's surface. This resulted in the Foundation covering up this report and providing a false appearance of SCP-484 being a normal specimen.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum 999.1:</strong></p><p>On ██/██/████ at 15:57, Agent ██████ of the ██████ ██████ Police Department became the first person to note any anomalous properties of SCP-999 in a public setting. Due to its anomalous nature and lack of traditional means for tracing, it is currently unknown how the fluid was discovered by members of the police department or where it was taken after being sampled by them.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.2:</strong></p><p>SCP-999 was isolated by Foundation personnel at Site-26 on ██/██/████ after information on its anomalous properties had been discovered by members of the ██████ ██████ Police Department and had made its way to the Foundation. After the discovery, SCP-999 was designated SCP-999.</p><p><strong>Addendum 999.3:</strong></p><p>In light of the discovery of SCP-999, a review of all printed material in the United States was undertaken by Research and Development, with the goal of discovering more instances of SCP-999 and potentially identifying any instances previously missed. Of the ████████ individuals questioned, only ██████ subjects reported that they had access to SCP-999; however, none could provide any further information regarding where it was kept or what happens when it is transported from its original location.</p>
