<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-697</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-697 is currently contained at Site-██. Due to its size, SCP-697 is kept in a large holding cell, measuring about 1 km in length and 0.5 km in width.</p><p>The perimeter of SCP-697's containment cell is lined with barbed wire, and patrolled by security teams armed with non-lethal weaponry. Access to SCP-697's containment cell is restricted to Site personnel.</p><p>Any staff members affected by SCP-697 are to be removed from the site and given treatment as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-697 is an unidentified species of large sea turtle, measuring approximately 2 km in length.</p><p>SCP-697's body is covered with a thick layer of armor plating, composed primarily of a calcium carbonate mineral. However, the bulk of SCP-697's shell is composed of kelp, despite not being native to its aquatic environment.</p><p>Incidentally, SCP-697's shell material seems to be unable to penetrate, puncture or otherwise damage any of the building materials present within the site it is kept at, despite the force and size of others that were able to cause this effect.</p><p>SCP-697 alters its body shape and tactics in order to avoid capture. It appears almost completely incapable of communicating verbally or through other sensory means. Instead, it utilizes a series of natural methods to communicate, including the use of large groups of predatory fish as sentinels; a crude method of vocalization; and by submerging itself completely in water, effectively ceasing all activity until reawakened by environmental stimuli.</p><p>SCP-697 will only speak when it is in danger or extremely agitated by another event. The exact content of whatever has caused SCP-697 to become distressed is unknown; however, there have been several cases where this has not been limited solely to verbal communication, but also extended to other forms of behavior shown by SCP-697.</p><p>Due to its size and appearance, SCP-697 is typically unapproachable unless provoked in some manner. In such cases, SCP-697 will fight with all available means necessary to defend itself from capture or death.</p><p>Although most individuals who are captured by SCP-697 show no signs prior to their containment within its enclosure that indicate they are aware that SCP-697 is what they are fighting against, there have been several instances recorded with abnormally long periods of time between being taken captive and showing signs that they realize this fact for what it is. Although these individuals have never exhibited any further anomalous behavior after escaping their confinement, the circumstances surrounding their initial capture remain a mystery.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-697's behavior has been observed to significantly increase in frequency following an event that involved the death of at least one individual. The exact cause of this change is unknown, and has only been observed to occur following events that could easily be considered accidents or coincidences.</p><p><strong>Prior Incident:</strong> A team of Foundation personnel had been carrying out a routine exploration and mapping of the ocean floor near Site-██. A team member was sent down to collect samples from a rock formation, and was not expected to return for several hours.</p><p>During this time, a group of researchers had entered Site-██'s containment cell to carry on with their research. As they were unaware that the containment cell was occupied, they continued on with their work.</p><p>When the researcher returned, he reported seeing a large mass of seaweed just outside of Site-██'s containment cell. Upon inspection, he discovered that there was something living inside.</p><p>At this point, two additional members of the team decided to investigate what they had found. Since it was still early in the morning and none of them had slept in several days, they wanted to take a look at what was inside of Site-██.</p><p>When they reached the containment cell, they began to open the door, only to be confronted by SCP-697, which began to attack them with its claws and teeth. Two other members of the team were able to reach cover behind a wall while two were pinned down by SCP-697. The remaining member attempted to flee, but was intercepted by SCP-697 and dragged back into the chamber.</p><p>Shortly after this incident, SCP-697 began to move towards site personnel who had been located further away from it. It is unclear if SCP-697 was attempting to escape, or if it simply wanted to finish off the other researchers who had not escaped its initial assault.</p>
