<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-327</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A perimeter fence has been erected around the area of SCP-327. All civilians and personnel entering the area are to be searched for signs of a ballpoint pen. In addition, all civilians and personnel entering that area are to sign a document stating that they will not bring any form of writing instrument in with them, even if it does not contain a ballpoint pen. Any civilian or personnel caught attempting to carry in a ballpoint pen will be suspended from duty indefinitely until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-327 is a small building that has been converted into a shop. The structure is covered in graffiti and has been cleaned up on several occasions but appears to serve no other function. Despite the fact that the walls of SCP-327 are covered in graffiti, not a single ballpoint pen has been found anywhere on any of its surfaces. A note scrawled above the doorway reads "What’s for donuts? You be the judge."</p><p>Whenever a civilian or personnel comes within two meters of SCP-327 at any time, they will begin experiencing severe stomach pains which will subside as soon as they leave SCP-327’s range. It is unknown whether or not this effect occurs if an individual is standing outside of SCP-327's range. If an individual is near SCP-327 when they use writing instruments, their stomach pains will grow stronger and last longer before ceasing once they have left the area. The pain rate increases the more advanced the writing instrument used by the subject (see Experiment Log 327).</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> Incident 327-1</p><p>On ██/██/████, a civilian was caught using a ballpoint pen in SCP-327's range. Upon being questioned, the civilian reported that they had forgotten their friend's birthday and were trying to write a note to remind them. The civilian was suspended from their job indefinitely after an interview with Dr. ██████ reveals that they had used a ballpoint pen.</p><p>Incident 327-2</p><p>On ██/██/████, a civilian was caught using a ballpoint pen in SCP-327's range. Upon being questioned, the civilian admitted to having been suffering from severe stomach pains and temporarily forgot about the event. The civilian was suspended from their job indefinitely after an interview with Dr. ██████ reveals that they had used a ballpoint pen.</p>
