<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-737</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-737 is to be kept in a standard containment locker, with no more than five (5) samples of SCP-737 currently in its storage containers. The rest of the stored specimens are to be placed in Storage Locker 29. All samples of SCP-737 are to be inspected for the presence of SCP-174, and if found, those samples have been placed into Storage Locker 29. In addition, a sample of SCP-924 is to be kept in a separate containment locker.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-737 is a brand of adhesive sealant that was manufactured in █████████, Ohio. The primary differences between SCP-737 and other materials are the presence of three (3) blisters on the back of the plastic container that contains SCP-737, as well as the application of a white substance similar to paint. When used, these anomalous properties of SCP-737 cause an effect identical to that of SCP-174. This effect causes the self-assembling of a circular staircase in any location where SCP-737 has been applied, which will continue to gather momentum until it collapses from its own weight. Further testing on this effect is pending approval.</p><p>SCP-737 was discovered after several local police departments received reports from citizens describing their homes transforming into staircases. Authorities were advised to use caution before responding, as any officers or civilians who attempted to enter the affected locations would not be able to retreat due to the area collapsing upon their return. In addition, all mobile phones, including those with satellite imagery, had no record of the affected area. This led researchers to hypothesize that SCP-737 had been manufactured by an unknown entity and deliberately released into society by accident.</p><p>In order to prevent further accidental civilian exposure and any potential breach of containment, a global search for additional instances of SCP-737 began after Incident 736-817. At time of writing, thirty (30) samples have been identified across North America and Europe, many being located in remote areas such as national parks and forests. A full list of known instances may be found at Containment Area 737 Site Documents.</p><p>Attempts at attempting to destroy or remove instances of SCP-737 have been equally unsuccessful; multiple objects ranging from heavy equipment to small drones have been utilized in attempts to breach the affected areas, but all attempts have failed due to gravity causing subsequent collapses. Despite this information being available since Incident 736-817, research into the anomalous properties of SCP-737 has not yet been completed due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 737-1:</strong> On 19/8/2018, the Foundation was contacted by a security guard at ████████ ██████████, who reported that the staircases in the shopping centre had begun to collapse. The Foundation was informed that the affected area contained several stores and restaurants for both civilians and personnel stationed at Area 7██. After abstaining from aiding local law enforcement and civilian authorities due to possible breaches of containment, the Foundation instructed Area 7██ to evacuate all civilians via helicopter. After a brief discussion with their superiors, the head of security requested permission to evacuate her own family before evacuating, which was granted and the civilians were evacuated successfully. Following this incident, the Foundation began negotiations with Area 7██ officials to maintain permanent Foundation presence in the area.']</p>
