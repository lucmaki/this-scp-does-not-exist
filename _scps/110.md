<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-110</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-110 is located in a standard containment cell. The cell is to be kept in high humidity conditions, with a small pool of water inside the cell. If an investigation has led to the loss of mass, it is to be replaced in the water source and returned to the containment cell. In order to keep up the humidity, sheets are hung over the exterior of the cell.</p><p>In addition, a large fan is installed on the ceiling of this room at all hours of day and night. During attempts to "lose" SCP-110, no fewer than ten (10) staff members are to stand around the containment cell and direct wind upon it. No outside observers are permitted in this area during testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-110 refers to a device of unknown design, with a point on one end, used in experiments that attempt to "lose" mass. It consists of an enclosure filled with water, a power source capable of running the device, and a small electronic control panel. The enclosure is cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of about 2 meters. In front of the enclosure is a small flat disk with an elaborate pattern etched into it.</p><p>In order to carry out their experiments, researchers place SCP-110 into the center of a chamber with a large amount of water (at least 20 tons). This chamber is then sealed to ensure the location is stable and contains no air. Researchers then turn the power on and wait for several hours. During this time, they move slowly toward the center of the chamber while writing on sheets of paper they are holding in their hands.</p><p>After several hours have passed, researchers notice that the force exerted on them has decreased significantly; as they get closer to the center of the chamber, this effect increases. As they begin to approach SCP-110, researchers can feel their mass decreasing, but have no way of measuring how much mass they are losing. After SCP-110 has completely removed all its mass from its enclosure and researchers are close to it, it will detach itself from the rest of the chamber and float toward an opening in its top. Thereafter, it will behave normally, except that it will no longer lose any mass when shaken or when it is rinsed out with water afterwards.</p><p>Note: Though subjectively less than one percent of all objects originally in the chamber were taken, testing has shown that roughly .00001% will remain behind once removed from their original location.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum 110-1:</strong> Following the loss of mass, researchers who have been affected by SCP-110 have reported feeling weak and tired. This effect has also been observed in all living animals and plants that have come into contact with it.</p><p>Experiment 110-8 - To test if SCP-110 is responsible for any other anomalous properties, a group of D-class personnel was placed in the center of a large chamber. Following this, a large object, designated SCP-███, was added to the chamber. Immediately after the addition of SCP-███, all personnel were affected by SCP-110; however, the effect was not nearly as severe when compared to what is experienced by subjects who are placed in the chamber without SCP-110. The reason for this difference is unknown.']</p>
