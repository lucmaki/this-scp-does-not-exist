<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-387</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-387 is to be stored in a standard Foundation titanium vault. The interior of SCP-387 is to be kept at a temperature of 5 °C.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-387 is a small, 129 m long ship (engulfing SCP-387 B) which uses a hybrid propulsion system consisting of internal combustion engines and magnetic drive motors. The propulsion system is located in the middle of the ship.</p><p>The engine compartment contains four cylindrical tanks, each lined with rubber membranes intended to prevent impact damage. These tanks, when filled with liquid fuel, expand slightly and are connected by hoses to the drive motors located outside of SCP-387. Gasoline is being burned when the speed of SCP-387 exceeds 25 knots (33.6 km/h). When the speed drops below this value, SCP-387 will begin to reduce its speed by accelerating or simply breaking from it. When SCP-387 has stopped, the fuel will evaporate into the atmosphere and leave no extra residue on it.</p><p>The ship's keel mounts two large underwater surveillance cameras on each side of the hull. They can be turned manually for aiming purposes. The camera housings are made of titanium but every tenth section has been replaced with metal reinforced plastic to better protect sensitive parts from damage caused by corrosion. As such, these parts are marked red on the exterior and internally as well.</p><p>SCP-387 emits a pitch black light coming from the open spaces in its deck and bridge area, despite the lack of any windows on those areas. This anomaly disappears whenever SCP-387 is traveling at speeds higher than 15 km/h with no additional sources of illumination present in those spaces.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-387 was discovered on the 7th of October, 2004 by the crew of a fishing trawler which was working in the North Atlantic Ocean. The body of the captain of the vessel was found inside SCP-387, having died with no immediate cause of death. Other crew members were found at different places inside SCP-387 and they seem to have been killed with blunt force trauma.</p><p>The captain's body was retrieved and taken to the nearest hospital, where it was cremated. However, the corpse did not burn completely, leaving behind a small, black and rusty substance which was recovered by Foundation agents.</p><p>The black material contains a small red letter 'C' on each piece of it. The letter is printed on both sides of each piece, except when the piece is burned up completely.</p>
