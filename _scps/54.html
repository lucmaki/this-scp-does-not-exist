<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-54</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-54 is to be contained in a standard containment cell with an additional isolation chamber containing a human subject. Further testing by SCP-54 has been postponed for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-54 appears to be a 17th Century ink and red seal letter written by the noted French scholar Pierre de Beaune. The message indicates that the author is sending SCP-54 in order to secure a position within the Palatinate of the Electorate of the Rhine. The contents of SCP-54 are as follows:</p><p>with this my heart, I announce you my desire to work useful here at the court of Cologne. I am [deleted] and 20 years old, and have already worked in Strasbourg and Mainz, but I don't know what all the dificulties that you can encounter with the Electorate.</p><p>I know I've said it repeatedly, but it is true that I need more experience, because otherwise I will not be able to give my entire attention to success in your highnesses' service.</p><p>The job I ask for merely has to exist: what we do is collect money from wealthy individuals (that's our ticket!). And from there we distribute it to different noble families, as well as filling countless coffers under the name of taxes (we can also literally empty them). It's a very lucrative business! But then again, being with nobility brings its own problems - they're always suspicious of anyone new.</p><p>And so far so good. But if I don't find a better place soon then I will have no other choice than going back home. That is why it's important that you answer this letter quickly.</p>
<p> <strong>Addendum:</strong> On 12/21/1993, SCP-54 was retrieved from the mailroom of the University of Cologne. The envelope bore the name "Pierre de Beaune", and its contents bore the following note:</p><p>To whom it may concern,</p><p>I\'m sorry for deserting you so suddenly. The job I\'ve been given had made me lose all interest in your service. I guess that\'s not the kind of thing one should be doing in their career. I hope things will work out well for you.</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>[deleted]</p>
