<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-627</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-627 is to be kept in a Secure Containment Locker at Site-48. The locker is to be locked with a standard security keypad entry system, and must be kept in a climate-controlled room.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-627 is a leather satchel, sealed by a brass padlock. The lock on SCP-627 reacts in the presence of salt, and if the correct combination of keys is entered, will open. However, no matter how many times this occurs, the lock remains closed.</p><p>Opening SCP-627 causes it to expand and compress unpredictably, until it has expanded to a dimension that is approximately 2m high, 1.5m deep, and 0.2m thick. After the phenomenon ceases, SCP-627 will appear to be empty.</p><p>Analysis of SCP-627's contents shows it contains a large number of D70 matchbooks (the type used by businesses in the Las Vegas area), as well as several dozen small notebooks with "Martha E Howe" written liberally on their covers. Sample excerpts from these notes are shown below</p><p>It has been suggested that Martha E Howe is an alias; however, due to damage done to these books by expansion during testing, and the fact that they do not appear to be expired, this seems unlikely. SCP-627 was recovered following reports of an elderly woman in Nevada who had collected salted matches for [DATA EXPUNGED]. On investigation of her home, Foundation agents discovered SCP-627.</p>
<p> <strong>["Addendum:</strong></p><p>Incident Log 627-1:</p><p><strong>24/11/1989:</strong> SCP-627 begins to expand, causing a tear in the nearby wall. Agent ████████ enters the room and attempts to secure the door, but becomes entrapped in the room's interior. After several minutes, the door is opened and Agent ████████ is found alive in the room's interior.</p><p><strong>25/11/1989:</strong> Agent ████████ reports disturbing visions of an elderly woman whose face was partially obscured by a piece of [DATA EXPUNGED] over her left eye. After several hours, Agent ████████ successfully leaves the room, and is returned to his quarters.</p><p><strong>28/11/1989:</strong> Agent ████████ reports experiencing pain in his arms, stating these pains have been occurring periodically for several days. Agents are given Class-A amnestics and are returned to their normal activities.</p><p><strong>18/04/1990:</strong> Agent ████████ returns to his office, where he uses his personal computer to search for information regarding SCP-627. He discovers that SCP-627's dimensions change when salted with a mixture containing 20% sodium chloride.</p><p><strong>30/04/1990:</strong> Agent ████████ claims to have had an argument with his wife, who claimed that she had contacted Martha E Howe for help in purchasing a home. Upon investigation, agents find an envelope from an attorney located in Las Vegas to ████████, which is stained with blood. The envelope shows evidence of having been torn across the top.</p><p><strong>06/05/1990:</strong> Agents on site report that they have heard singing coming from within SCP-627's dimensions, which they believe is coming from Agent ████████'s office.</p><p><strong>08/05/1990:</strong> Agents enter SCP-627's interior and discover Agent ████████ alive, but naked and covered in blood, standing directly in front of a [DATA EXPUNGED]. It is described as being approximately 1m tall and 0.1m wide; however, agents note that it appears to be human-sized due to its ability to stand upright on its hind legs, as well as its arms being twice as tall as its head. When questioned by agents about this phenomenon, Agent ████████ states that this object is not unusual for a place like Las Vegas.</p><p>Agent ████████ is brought back to his quarters and given amnestics."]</p>
