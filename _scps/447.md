<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-447</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-447 is to be kept in a large, sealed storage-type container at Site-16. The item itself is not to be removed from the container, in order to prevent any disruption of the wax coating on its surface.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-447 appears to be an electronic memo pad. The item is, however, coated with wax from end-to-end and top-to-bottom.</p><p>When a human visible at least eight (8) inches away from SCP-447 attempts to write on it, regardless of whether or not the writing is in English, or in any language for that matter, the writing will appear on its surface in the same way as ink would if it were applied by normal means. At no point during the process does the writing alter to seem 'foreign', nor will it change over time.</p><p>All writing done on SCP-447 remains on its surface until the item is returned to its original container; after which, writing done within itself will disappear forever.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On █/██/████, a group of researchers attempted to write on SCP-447 with a felt-tip pen. The writing appeared as a combination of various English words, as well as a few Chinese characters. The writing was non-sensical and completely ungrammatical.']</p>
