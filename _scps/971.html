<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-971</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-971 is to be contained in a secure area at Site ██, under armed guard. The mass of SCP-971 is an anomaly and must be handled with extreme caution. No testing involving SCP-971 may take place without the approval of 3 supervising personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-971 is the remains of a mass of approximately ████ metric tonnes of flesh and blood, in the form of a human male. Upon examination, it was determined that SCP-971 has been dead for approximately 40-45 years. The body appears to have been drained of all blood completely and has become a solid mass of flesh and muscle.</p><p>SCP-971 was discovered on ██/██/████ near the location of an old nuclear fallout shelter in [REDACTED] Oklahoma after local authorities were alerted to its presence by a group of hikers who had discovered it when searching for the remains of a crashed UFO.</p><p>The Foundation was contacted after agents relocated the hikers who first found it and then scanned the area with satellite imagery. The next day, two Foundation operatives were sent to investigate and retrieve SCP-971; however, upon approaching the body, both operatives became violently ill and fell unconscious. Containment protocols were enacted as soon as possible and SCP-971 was moved to Site ██ for further observation.</p><p>During tests involving SCP-971, subjects who directly view SCP-971 will develop severe headaches, nausea and loss of concentration around 30 minutes after viewing the object. These symptoms will continue until the subject is removed from SCP-971's vicinity or sedated; even if they are sedated, they will regain consciousness before long. Subjects are advised to avoid any contact with SCP-971 at all costs.</p>
