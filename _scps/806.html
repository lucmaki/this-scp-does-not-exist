<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-806</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A Compound of two (2) security fences, fifty (50)Â miles in length, and five (5) checkpoints must be maintained around the area in which SCP-806 is contained. Due to the anomalous nature of SCP-806, all individuals assigned to the area must sign a non-disclosure agreement before leaving the perimeter. Personnel who wish to take photographs or videos of SCP-806 are prohibited from doing so.</p><p>Any humanoid cadavers found outside of the containment zone are to be incinerated. All personnel must have signed and notarized documentation preventing them from consuming any food during tenure with the Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-806 is a mobile bakery located within an abandoned sealed desert community in southern Utah, USA. SCP-806 has been operating for twenty-five (25) years and appears to be a standard cafe of similar size and appearance. The interior of SCP-806 shows signs of wear, with stains on the walls, equipment and furnishings.</p><p>All members of Foundation personnel assigned to SCP-808 will experience sensations similar to eating a sweet muffin while they are inside SCP-806. The sensation is described as pleasant and flavorful rather than off putting or bitter. This sensation will last throughout the duration that personnel have been present within the premises of SCP-806. Due to its anomalous nature, the effect does not occur outside of SCP-806.</p><p>The sensation produced by SCP-806 was originally observed in 1996. Foundation personnel assigned to examine the area described it as resembling "freshly baked dough", "something crispy" and a "crunchy muffin". Further research into the potential anomalous nature of SCP-806 was initiated after complaints from personnel involved in mundane duties became more frequent due to increased consumption of food brought in from outside.</p>
<p> <strong>['Addendum:</strong> On 08/31/2012, SCP-806 was discovered to have been operating for twenty-five (25) years with no business license. Foundation personnel have been informed of the anomalous nature of SCP-806 and staffing levels were raised accordingly.</p><p>On 09/12/2012, testing has been approved using D-class personnel. Testing has revealed that the effect of SCP-806 is "incomplete", causing D-class personnel to receive a sensation similar to a "bitter donut". Furthermore, D-class personnel are not affected by SCP-806 outside of it.']</p>
